"abortion","Anti-abortion groups furious as FDA approves generic abortion pill","In a move that has left anti-abortion advocates reeling, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) quietly approved a request to manufacture a new abortion pill earlier this week. Thanks to the approval, a company called Evita Solutions will be able to manufacture its generic version of mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in most US medication abortions. A generic version of mifepristone, which was first approved as a brand-name drug in 2000, is already available on the market. Yet the approval stunned and infuriated foes of abortion, who have spent the three years since the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade pressuring the federal government to curb access to mifepristone. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, announced last month his department would review the safety of mifepristone. “FDA had promised to do a top-to-bottom safety review of the chemical abortion drug, but instead they’ve just greenlighted new versions of it for distribution,” Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri and fierce abortion opponent, posted on X. “I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.” Kristan Hawkins, president of the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, called the approval “a true failure”. “This is a stain on the Trump presidency,” she added in a statement. To bolster their attack on mifepristone, anti-abortion activists recently seized on an April paper by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing thinktank, claiming almost 11% of women experience sepsis or other serious complications within 45 days of taking mifepristone. In his letter announcing the review of mifepristone, Kennedy cited the center’s paper. But that paper was not peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal, and experts have uncovered multiple flaws in it. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – wherein an embryo implants somewhere outside of the uterine lining – as a serious complication. Mifepristone does not cause or worsen ectopic pregnancies. Meanwhile, more than 100 studies, conducted across more than three decades and dozens of countries, have concluded that mifepristone is a safe and effective tool to end a pregnancy. Abortion rights supporters celebrated the news of the FDA’s approval, proclaiming it a victory for evidence-backed medicine. “By expanding generic options, the agency is reinforcing mifepristone’s impeccable safety record,” Kiki Freedman, co-founder and CEO of the telemedicine abortion provider Hey Jane, said in a statement. “At a time when politically motivated attacks threaten to undermine science and restrict care, it’s critical to underscore that the science couldn’t be clearer.” The health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, a spokesperson for the department told the New York Times in a statement that “the FDA has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug”. “By law, the secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug,” the spokesperson said.","2025-10-02T23:44:59Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/generic-abortion-pill-fda-mifepristone"
"abortion","What Tuesday’s elections mean for the future of abortion rights","Supporters of abortion rights have spent much of the last year trying to fight Donald Trump’s attempts to undermine access to the procedure. Now, Democrats’ commanding victories in the 2025 elections have breathed new life into the fight. Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill’s respective gubernatorial victories in Virginia and New Jersey will shield abortion rights in two states that have become havens for people fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, voters decided to retain three liberal supreme court justices, maintaining Democratic control of a bench that could decide the future of abortion rights in the deeply purple state. The sweeping support for California’s Proposition 50, a redistricting measure that will help Democrats pick up extra seats in the US House, will also likely defend national access to abortion. If Republicans are able to strengthen their grip on the US House and Senate in 2026, they may secure the votes they need to pass an abortion ban or extend legislation that has already left Planned Parenthood defunded for the next year. In the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, unleashing a wave of state-level abortion bans, the fight over abortion rights has become one of the most important issues in US elections. Democrats’ unexpectedly strong showing in the 2022 midterms were largely attributed to outrage over Roe’s demise, while even voters in Republican strongholds repeatedly voted for ballot measures that protected access to the procedure. Yet when Kamala Harris failed to win the White House in 2024, despite her campaign’s foregrounding of abortion rights, questions rose about whether the issue could still propel Democrats to victory. Recent polling has also suggested that, compared with 2024 and 2023, protecting access to abortion is no longer as important to voters. The elections in Virginia perhaps provided a most revealing glimpse into how voters are now thinking about abortion, as well as the future of the procedure. In a debate against Spanberger, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears accused Spanberger of supporting “abortion up until the very hour that the baby could be born, up until the very minute. “You would have a baby aborted on the table,” claimed Earle-Sears, Virginia’s lieutenant governor. Trump has also spent years making similar – and similarly baseless – claims about Democrats. Only about 1% of abortions take place at or after about 21 weeks of pregnancy, and no abortions take place at or after birth. That would be infanticide, which is already illegal across the US. Although Spanberger – like many of the other Democrats who claimed victory on Tuesday night – primarily focused on affordability, her campaign also emphasized abortion. Of the $11m that her campaign spent on TV ads over the last year, $1.1m went towards ads that, in the last few weeks of the campaign, highlighted Earle-Sears’ views on abortion, CNN reported. While Earle-Sears tried to downplay her views on abortion during her campaign, she has repeatedly said that she personally opposes the procedure. Advocacy groups also poured money into expanding awareness of abortion in the Virginia races. The American Civil Liberties Union, for instance, spent about $1.8m in Virginia on voter education campaigns that predominantly focused on candidates’ stances on abortion. Ultimately, Earle-Sears’ fear-mongering rhetoric on abortion did not appear to hold sway with Virginia voters: Spanberger won a decisive 57% of the vote, according to the most recent polling totals. Democrats will now control the Virginia house, senate and governor’s mansion for the first time since Roe fell. They will likely be able to pass a constitutional amendment that would add abortion rights to the state constitution; although the amendment has already passed the state legislature once, it must pass twice in consecutive years before heading to voters. If Virginia Democrats move forward with the constitutional amendment, abortion will almost certainly dominate the state’s politics in next year’s elections, too. In a statement, Mini Timmaraju, the president of the advocacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, celebrated the fact that Virginia Democrats successfully expanded their majority in the state house. “This sweep proves what we have seen again and again: when candidates run on expanding and protecting abortion access, they win,” Timmaraju said.","2025-11-06T12:00:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/tuesday-elections-future-abortion-rights"
"abortion","Wisconsin Planned Parenthood clinics suspend abortion services amid funding crisis","Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin will stop providing abortions on Wednesday, as the organization’s centers across the country struggle to navigate the fallout of a law that blocks the the reproductive healthcare giant from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid. Thanks to a provision in Donald Trump’s new tax and spending bill, abortion providers that receive more than $800,000 in reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people, are blocked from participating in the program for one year. That provision is so narrowly tailored that it applies almost exclusively to Planned Parenthood, long a conservative target. It is already illegal to use federal Medicaid dollars to pay for most abortions. Instead, Planned Parenthood clinics rely on Medicaid to pay for services such as cancer screenings, STI tests and contraception. By ending its abortion provision, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin appears to be attempting to continue receiving Medicaid reimbursements for those other services. The measure is intended to be temporary, the regional affiliate said in a statement. “This was always the intent of the Trump administration’s law to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood: sow chaos and confusion, shut down Planned Parenthood health centers, strip access to essential health care from patients, and make it harder for everyone, everywhere to get an abortion – even in states where it’s legal,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the organization’s national office, said in a statement. “This is the chaos they wanted to see.” Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is believed to be the first affiliate to cease providing abortions in a state where the procedure remains legal. Autonomy News first reported the news of the suspension. At least two independent abortion providers are still open in Wisconsin. However, a consortium of abortion rights supporters in neighboring Illinois said in a statement that they “stand ready” to receive people traveling from Wisconsin for abortions. Without Medicaid, Planned Parenthood estimates that up to 200 of its clinics may be forced to close. More than 60% of the clinics at risk for closure are in rural or “medically under-served areas”, while roughly 90% of the clinics are located in blue states that protect abortion rights. Maine and Washington state have allocated money to Planned Parenthood affiliates to cover the shortfall caused by the defunding provision. Maine is also sending money to Maine Family Planning, another abortion provider that was also defunded by Trump’s tax and spending bill. However, Maine Family Planning announced on Wednesday that, without Medicaid, it had no choice but to stop offering primary care at its clinics by 31 October. The organization said in a statement that its clinics will continue offering services such as STI screenings and contraception to all patients, regardless of insurance status, “for as long as we are able”. About 70% of Maine Family Planning patients receive all of their healthcare from the organization. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kentucky and Oregon have said that they will try to see Medicaid patients for free for as long as possible. But that’s not a sustainable plan, according to Sara Kennedy, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette in Oregon. Prior to the passage of Trump’s bill, about 70% of the affiliate’s patients used Medicaid. Now the affiliate anticipates losing upwards of $12m in Medicaid revenue over the next year. “Every day we are seeing hundreds to thousands of Medicaid patients and we are not getting reimbursed for any of those services. So that is unsustainable for any business,” Kennedy said. “If the state doesn’t step in urgently to be able to support and protect reproductive healthcare access, there will be no other choice except for us to start charging patients.” Many clinics were already facing dire financial straits even before Trump’s tax and spending bill. This year, at least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics across seven states have shuttered or have announced plans to close soon.","2025-10-01T18:54:52Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/wisconsin-planned-parenthood-abortion-funding"
"abortion","Belén review – gripping true story of woman unjustly accused of illegal abortion","Belén is a pseudonym; in 2014, a 25-year-old woman arrived at a hospital in Argentina with severe abdominal pain that turned out to be a miscarriage. She had no idea she was 22 weeks pregnant, but doctors suspected she had had an abortion, then illegal in Argentina, and called the police. Belén was charged with aggravated homicide and sentenced to eight years in prison. When her case was taken up by feminist lawyer Soledad Deza it sparked protests, thousands taking to the streets in green scarves. This heartfelt drama tells the story, mostly from the perspective of lawyer Deza (played by the film’s director Dolores Fonzi). It begins in the hospital. The doctor in charge barely bothers to look up at Belén from his clipboard – she is a poor working-class woman and this will determine her fate. After a foetus is found in the hospital toilet, police arrive, handcuffing Belén to her bed. They do not carry out DNA tests on the foetus, so there is no physical evidence – a fact not raised by the blood-boilingly lazy defence at her trial. The real-life Belén has always chosen to remain anonymous, which might explain why her character takes a back seat here, though Camila Plaate’s sensitive supporting performance gives us a glimpse into Belén’s growing political awareness. The film is essentially a legal procedural: solid, mostly entertaining and occasionally gripping. It follows Deza and her team step by step as they battle the system to get Belén her appeal. As the case gathers pace, it takes over Deza’s waking hours, causing ripples of resentment in her family. It’s a reminder of expectations around work and home for women – it doesn’t matter how important your job is, missing your child’s violin recital will not be forgiven. The film ends on an absolute punch-the-air high with real-life footage on the streets in December 2020 when abortion in Argentina was legalised, faces filled with delight and tears of joy. • Belén is in UK and US cinemas from 7 November and on Prime Video from 14 November.","2025-11-05T07:00:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/05/belen-review-gripping-true-story-of-woman-unjustly-accused-of-abortion"
"abortion","SA attorney general refers anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe’s fundraiser ‘game’ for investigation","A “fun little game” launched by the anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe to raise funds during an emotional debate over late-pregnancy abortion in South Australia has been referred for investigation. Howe, who has worked with conservative politicians to introduce various state and federal bills to water down abortion rights, said the bingo card-style game was a fundraiser for an anti-abortion war chest. She launched it on Wednesday as SA’s legislative council prepared to debate a bill to roll back access to abortion later in pregnancy. The bill was defeated by 11 votes to eight, with several MLCs becoming visibly distressed and tearful during the debate. Howe worked with the former One Nation MLC Sarah Game, now an independent, on the legislation and stood with her at the press conference about its introduction. In “Sarah’s Game”, Howe urged people to “buy” words and phrases which she said exposed “the cliched, predictable and evil language used by pro-abortion politicians”. The phrases included “between a woman and her doctor”, “misinformation and/or disinformation”, “trust the experts” and “Trumpian-style politics”. Howe initially said it would be accessible only through a private link, although it was publicly available until Thursday morning. The Greens MLC Robert Simms told parliament on Wednesday the game trivialised debate and debased the parliament. The independent MLC Tammy Franks said she was horrified that Howe was charging people to play a game centred on abortion. “This is not an episode of Black Mirror. This is literally something that happened in SA,” she told parliament. “She seems to always be on the grift,” she said, adding that Howe did not include words relating to those who would no longer have access to abortion under the proposal. “Rape, incest, sexual slavery and girls, because that is actually what we are talking about here.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Franks also told parliament Howe was one of the state’s top social media advertising spenders, splashing thousands of dollars on Meta to spread her messages. The SA attorney general, Kyam Maher, said he would refer the game – which has a top prize of dinner with Howe and her furniture designer husband, James – to the “appropriate authorities”. Guardian Australia has asked the Department of Consumer and Business Affairs for details. Howe, who is a law professor and expert in labour migration at the University of Adelaide, has been approached for comment. She said on Instagram that “as predicted the left is melting down over our game”. Game told InDaily she had not heard about the game until after its launch and “did not feel strongly” about it. Howe has been banned from state parliament after alleged “threatening and intimidating tactics” over a previous later abortion bill that she was also involved in creating. She has denied doing anything wrong and said she would challenge the ban. In the lead-up to that debate, she worked with the Liberal MLC Ben Hood on a bill that, if a woman sought an abortion after 27 weeks and six days, would instead make her give birth. During debate over that 2024 SA bill, Howe labelled female opponents members of the “Baby Killers Club”. On Thursday, she added those who opposed the 2025 bill to that “club”, with distorted images of them that appear to be artificially generated. In recent years Howe has been prolific on social media and active in lobbying state and federal parliaments on abortion law. The former prime minister Tony Abbott appeared at a rally she organised in New South Wales in May. The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts promoted her petition on “Priya’s law”, while his leader, Pauline Hanson, has visited Howe at home for a cup of tea and appeared on her YouTube channel. Howe claims on YouTube that her movement can take “full credit” for putting later abortion on the national agenda. She said that after she posted about Priya’s law, Andrew Hastie, Tony Pasin, Barnaby Joyce and Henry Pike spoke out against it. In 2024 she appeared in a press conference with the Coalition senators Matt Canavan and Alex Antic over another anti-abortion bill. Antic has appeared as a guest on her social media posts, including YouTube videos and Instagram reels, and at rallies she has organised. In NSW, the Libertarian party MP John Ruddick thanked her in public for her activism and joined her rally and a speaking tour for his upcoming abortion bill. He has also appeared on her social media posts multiple times. The Queensland state MP Robbie Katter has also been a vocal supporter and features Howe on his media release about another anti-abortion bill. MPs opposed to anti-abortion legislation say they and their staff have received abuse and death threats from third parties after the controversies generated by Howe. Howe also organised a rally on the parliament steps for Wednesday night with speakers including Game and Antic.","2025-11-13T14:00:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/13/joanna-howe-anti-abortion-activist-sa-attorney-general-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Louisiana issues warrant for California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills","Louisiana issued a warrant for a California-based doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to the red state, court records filed earlier this month show. The warrant is part of a burgeoning effort by anti-abortion activists and red states to target telemedicine abortion, which now accounts for one in four US abortions, and abortion providers who ship pills across state lines. These providers operate out of blue states, like California, that have enacted “shield laws” that aim to protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecution. The 2024 warrant for the doctor remains outstanding, according to the documents, which were filed as part of Louisiana’s effort to join a federal lawsuit that seeks to limit access to the common abortion pill mifepristone. Louisiana bans virtually all abortions. In a declaration filed to the court, a Louisiana woman named Rosalie Markezich said that when she learned she was pregnant in 2023, she decided to continue her pregnancy. But her then boyfriend used her email and mailing address to order mifepristone and a second drug, misoprostol – which is typically used in US medication abortions – from Dr Remy Coeytaux. In its own filing, Louisiana does not explicitly name Coeytaux as the target of its warrant, but says it is for the arrest of “the California-based doctor from whom Rosalie’s boyfriend ordered the abortion drugs”. During a drive with her boyfriend, Markezich insisted that she wanted to keep the pregnancy, her declaration alleges. He began shouting at her and, fearful of her safety, Markezich decided to take the pills with the plan of throwing them up later on. She was unable to vomit and, soon after taking the pills, started to bleed. “Had the FDA required an in-person visit with a doctor before dispensing the drugs, my boyfriend would never have been able to obtain the drugs that he made me take,” Markezich said. “I also would have told the doctor that I did not want to take them. And I would have told the doctor that I wanted to keep my baby.” A spokesperson for Coeytaux declined to comment on the Louisiana warrant, which was reported last week by Abortion Every Day. In a statement, Liz Murrill, the Louisiana attorney general, suggested she hoped the Trump administration would roll back rules that expanded access to telemedicine abortion. “Rosalie is bravely representing many women who are victimized by the illegal, immoral and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,” Murrill said. A spokesperson for Murrill didn’t immediately respond to questions about what charges Coeytaux may be facing. Coeytaux has already been at the center of several anti-abortion legal filings. In July, a Texas man sued Coeytaux for allegedly supplying abortion pills to his girlfriend. Then, in August, Texas sent a cease-and-desist to Coeytaux. Texas law prohibits nearly all abortions. Texas and Louisiana have also gone after Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to people in both states. Louisiana has indicted Carpenter, while Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, sued her in civil court. After a New York county clerk refused to enforce a court’s fine against Carpenter, citing the state’s shield law, Paxton sued the clerk. In return, Letitia James, the New York attorney general, announced she would formally intervene to defend New York’s shield law. Legal experts widely expect the US supreme court to ultimately step in to adjudicate legal clashes between states that ban abortion and those that protect the procedure.","2025-09-29T22:27:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/louisiana-california-doctor-abortion-pills-warrant"
"abortion","Farage urged to explain anti-abortion links to meeting with Trump officials","Nigel Farage has been urged to explain why a US anti-abortion advocacy group helped arrange a meeting in London with Trump administration officials and diplomats. The meeting, first reported by the New York Times, took place in March between Farage and a delegation from Trump’s state department, which it said was overseen by the US embassy and brokered by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) group. The meeting was said to have discussed abortion rights, free speech and online safety laws. ADF, which supports free speech and religious freedom, has worked in Britain to help challenge the prosecutions of Christians who were arrested for praying silently outside abortion clinics, breaching “buffer zones”. The group, which is non-politically partisan and says it is a human rights charity, said it was not present at the meeting and had never met with Reform UK politicians to discuss abortion law. In response to the meeting, the Liberal Democrats accused Farage of working with Trump officials and anti-abortion campaigners who want to water down women’s rights and urged him to explain what was discussed. Daisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, also called on the government to summon the US ambassador to get to the bottom of “what looks like a blatant attempt to interfere in the UK’s domestic laws”. “Nigel Farage needs to come clean … and explain if his party would weaken women’s rights if he came to power,” she said. “The Liberal Democrats will stand up against these attempts to turn Trump’s America into Farage’s Britain and roll back the clock on decades of progress.” Reform was approached for comment. Asked by the New York Times about his relationship with the ADF, Farage said his party talks with “all sorts of groups” and denied speaking against abortion, telling a reporter that she was “talking utter bollocks”. He said that abortion was “No 468” on Reform UK’s agenda and noted he had “hardly ever spoken about it in 30 years”. “My point was that the 24-week limit was looking in serious jeopardy given that we actually spend a fortune saving babies at 22 weeks,” he said. “Maybe we need to rethink all of that because there is clearly a legal inconsistency.” The New York Times also reported that the ADF helped to arrange Farage’s three-hour testimony to US Congress earlier this year, where he described Britain as “awful” and criticised the Online Safety Act. An ADF International spokesman said: “The Liberal Democrats have made allegations here that are simply wrong. To be clear, ADF International has never met with any Reform UK politician to discuss abortion law. We never attended any breakfast meeting between US embassy staff and Nigel Farage. And it was the US House Judiciary Committee, not ADF International, that decided who should testify before Congress. “The reality is ADF International is a registered human rights charity in the UK and is non-politically partisan. We are committed to tackling the free speech crisis in this country and to protecting fundamental freedoms for all across the world.” A spokesman for the US embassy in London said officials regularly met those from different faiths and “elements of the political spectrum” in Britain and “anywhere else where freedom of expression is under threat.” In February, the US vice-president, JD Vance, told the Munich Security Conference that UK prosecutions of those defying abortion buffer zones showed a “backslide away from conscience rights” and a “retreat” from free speech. He highlighted the case of Adam Smith-Connor who was convicted last October of breaching a designated “safe zone” outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic.","2025-10-16T15:57:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/farage-urged-to-explain-anti-abortion-links-to-meeting-with-trump-officials"
"abortion","Abortion pill providers targeted by new Texas law refuse ‘anticipatory obedience’","Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, on Wednesday signed into law a bill that lets people sue anyone suspected of manufacturing, distributing or mailing abortion pills to or from Texas. The first-of-its-kind law is almost certain to dramatically escalate the state-by-state showdown over abortion laws in the post Roe v Wade United States – especially as some out-of-state abortion providers have already vowed that they will continue shipping pills to Texans. “Our mantra as a practice is: ‘No anticipatory obedience’,” said Dr Angel Foster, co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), a Boston-area based group that uses telemedicine to ship abortion pills to patients across the United States. “We will continue to provide care until we are legally unable to do so in Massachusetts.” Under the new law, which will take effect 4 December, abortion providers could face penalties of at least $100,000 if they mail pills into the state, which bans virtually all abortions. Pharmaceutical manufacturers who make drugs that Texans use for abortions could also be found liable, but they may be able to defend themselves by proving in court that they adopted and implemented “a policy to not distribute, mail, transport, deliver, provide, or possess abortion-inducing drugs” – though the language of the law is somewhat ambiguous on whether that provision applies to Texas or more broadly. Women who take abortion pills are not eligible to be sued. “We want to create liability for manufacturers that Aid Access is using,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life and a chief backer of the new legislation, in an interview before the bill’s passage. Aid Access is one of the biggest telemedicine abortion services in the US. It shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents between 2023 and 2024. Seago continued: “The best we can do at this point is create a higher liability and start trying to deter some of those individuals.” The law represents the cutting edge of the anti-abortion movement’s campaign against abortion pills and telehealth, which have become increasingly popular in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. By the end of 2024, one in four US abortions were being facilitated through telemedicine, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. #WeCount found that, in December 2024, nearly 4,000 Texans used telehealth to end their pregnancies. Providers like the Map mail pills under legal innovations known as “shield laws”, which have been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions when they send pills into states with bans. However, shield laws have yet to be seriously tested in court. Rachel Rebouché, professor at the University of Texas, Austin School of Law who studies shield laws, said Texas’s new law is the first legislative challenge to shield laws. But the state has already challenged them in other ways. The Texas attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, has sent cease-and-desist letters to abortion pill providers and a website that provides information about abortion pills. He has also sued a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a Texan, as well as a New York court official who said New York’s shield law prevented him from enforcing a Texas fine against the doctor. New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, has declared that she will intervene in that lawsuit. Many post-Roe abortion pill providers, Rebouché pointed out, have already accepted that their work involves a great deal of risk. “But it might chill, it might hamper or dissuade people who don’t want to be implicated, who don’t want to face the risk of liability.” Her Safe Harbor, an organization that uses shield laws to mail abortion pills to people and received one of Paxton’s cease-and-desist letters, has no plans to block Texans from its services, said Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works with the group, in an interview before Abbott signed the law. In fact, as the Texas law neared passage in the state legislature, Her Safe Harbor started receiving so many requests for help from patients that it had to double its number of abortion providers, according to Lynch. “Even if a law was passed that said they would come after us criminally and not civilly – that would not have any impact whatsoever on the services that we provide,” Lynch said. “It’s important that women know that.”","2025-09-18T13:47:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/18/abortion-pill-texas-law"
"abortion","Anti-abortion activists pardoned by Trump face trial for new clinic ‘invasion’","Six anti-abortion activists, include two previously pardoned by Donald Trump, will stand trial on state charges that they trespassed on an abortion clinic’s property and refused to leave. The six, who were also charged with criminal conspiracy, were due in court on Wednesday, but waived their right to appear – a move that is tantamount to pleading not guilty, according to lawyer John Williamson. A trial date has not been set. Abortion rights advocates say anti-abortion activists have become far bolder over the last several months, after the Trump administration announced it would curtail enforcement of the law historically used to prosecute similar disruptions to abortion providers’ work. The group was arrested in July when two women walked into the Delaware County Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Upland, Pennsylvania, for scheduled appointments. But they were not really looking for abortions. Instead, they were there to usher other anti-abortion activists into the clinic, according to police reports and an eyewitness. The activists started trying to talk patients out of having abortions, the reports and the eyewitness said. When clinic staff asked them to leave, the activists refused – and started to sprinkle a clear liquid and white powder around the abortion clinic. When the police arrived, they ultimately arrested six protesters. The clear liquid and white powder, they told police, were holy water and salt. These clinic “invasions” – as abortion rights supporters call them – or “rescues”, as they are known among anti-abortion activists, are nothing new. During these actions, anti-abortion activists enter clinics and attempt to interfere with services, often through trying to talk women out of getting abortions, loudly praying, or physically blocking staffers’ and patients’ way. Between 1977 and 2024, abortion opponents carried out more than 500, according to the National Abortion Federation. Days after Trump took office, the Department of Justice announced that it would limit use of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act, which creates federal penalties for people who go beyond peaceful protest to threaten, obstruct or injure someone who is trying to access a reproductive health clinic. Enacted in 1994, the law was supposed to protect clinics against a rising tide of anti-abortion harassment and violence. But the Department of Justice claimed that the Face Act had been unfairly used to target anti-abortion protesters, to the point of ignoring attacks on crisis pregnancy centers, anti-abortion facilities that aim to convince people to continue their pregnancies. (The Biden administration used the Face Act to prosecute multiple people for vandalizing such centers.) Face Act prosecutions are now only permitted in “extraordinary circumstances” or in cases involving death, serious bodily harm or significant property damage. The department also dismissed several ongoing Face Act cases, while Trump pardoned almost two dozen people convicted under the Face Act. For some abortion rights supporters, Trump’s actions felt like putting a target on their backs. None of the defendants involved in the Pennsylvania case are charged with breaking the Face Act. “Every day, I walk through a protest. I’m very comfortable seeing protests. I’ve participated in protests. I recognize the benefits of those,” said Amanda Kifferly, vice-president for abortion access and director of security at the Women’s Center. But, Kifferly continued: “It is not normal for someone to come into your office and pretend to be someone. It is also not normal for someone to come into your office and sprinkle clear fluids and white powder.” Williamson is representing Bell. In his view, her actions do not constitute a crime, much less a potential Face Act violation. “I think it’s ridiculous to bring any kind of charge against someone who is only trying to save some lives,” Williamson said. None of the lawyers for the other defendants returned a request for comment. Bell and Goodman are the first beneficiaries of Trump’s Face Act pardons to return to entering abortion clinics, according to Melissa Fowler, the National Abortion Federation’s chief program officer. But others involved in Face Act cases have also vowed to resume such actions. In one case detailed in court records, a man who barricaded himself inside a Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood clinic’s bathroom for more than three hours – forcing the clinic to cancel almost 50 appointments – pledged right afterward to “do it again”. (The justice department has dismissed his case.) So far in 2025, anti-abortion activists have carried out six “invasions” and three blockades in 2025, compared with five “invasions” and one blockade in all of 2024, according to preliminary numbers shared with the Guardian by the National Abortion Federation. Clinics have also reported 67,155 incidents of threatening or suspicious mail, calls and social media comments, compared with fewer than 2,000 in 2024. “There’s the feeling, for protesters, of a little bit of invincibility,” said one abortion provider, who does not work at the Women’s Center, of Trump’s decision to curtail enforcement of the Face Act. The provider asked to speak anonymously because of a recent increase in threats. The Trump administration is now using the Face Act in other ways. Last week, it cited the law in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against pro-Palestinian demonstrators who protested at a New Jersey synagogue. Although the language of the Face Act also protects “place of religious worship”, the federal government has never used the act to do so, a justice department official confirmed at a press conference announcing the charges. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on this story.","2025-10-09T16:10:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/anti-abortion-activists-pardoned-trump-trial"
"abortion","Tracking abortion laws across the United States","The US supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade may have abolished the national right to abortion, but the state-by-state battle for abortion rights is far from over. Since Roe was overturned in 2022, 12 states have enacted near-total abortion bans, while four states – Georgia, South Carolina, Florida and Iowa – have banned abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Other states have enacted laws or held ballot referendums to protect abortion rights. In flux In a handful of other states, the future of abortion is in flux due to legal challenges. In May 2025, for instance, the Missouri state supreme court effectively reinstated the state’s abortion ban by vacating lower-court orders that had allowed abortion providers to offer the procedure. Missouri is one of 10 states that held votes on abortion-related ballot measures during the November 2024 elections, with seven of them approving amendments to either overturn bans or enshrine existing rights. All of this tumult has led to a deeply uneven abortion landscape, with access to abortion clinics cut off across much of the south and midwest but standing strong on both coasts. The map below shows where state abortion laws stand as of 28 May2025. Sources: Abortion laws come from Center for Reproductive Rights, AbortionFinder and state statutes.

"abortion","Abortion is on the ballot in three US states, from supreme court to governor","When the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade more than three years ago, unleashing a wave of state-level abortion bans, the justices catapulted abortion rights to the top of US voters’ minds. The issue has dominated every election cycle since – and 2025 is no different. The gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia could have sweeping consequences for abortion access in two states that have become havens for women fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, what should have been a relatively sleepy judicial-retention election has evolved into the most expensive race of its kind in nearly 50 years, largely due to heated fighting over abortion. With voters weighing whether to keep three Democratic justices on the state supreme court, advocates fear that liberals may lose control of the bench and, ultimately, lose abortion access in the purple state. New Jersey New Jersey is one of the most abortion-friendly states in the country, since it does not place a gestational limit on the procedure. But abortion rights activists fear that could soon change, depending on the outcome of the contest between Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former New Jersey representative, and Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a current representative for the state. While Sherrill supports New Jersey’s existing law, Ciattarelli believes abortion should be banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy. He has also voted multiple times to strip government funding from Planned Parenthood and wants to block minors from having abortions unless they have notified their parents. “I’ve always supported a woman’s right to choose,” Ciattarelli said in a recent debate. “What I don’t support is making New Jersey the abortion capital of the country, inviting other people – people from other states – to come to New Jersey and have their abortions performed. I don’t support that, let alone use taxpayer dollars to do that.” “When you put in place things like my opponent has suggested, people die,” Sherrill shot back. “These are not pro-choice positions.” Over the last few weeks, both Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All have announced six-figure ad buys to support Sherrill. Polling from Rutgers University–New Brunswick found that, as of late October, Sherrill was leading Ciattarelli by five points. Pennsylvania Come November, Pennsylvania voters will decide whether to retain sitting state supreme court justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht, all of whom are Democrats. If voters decide to kick any of the justices out, the state’s Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, will appoint a temporary replacement to hold the seat until a competitive election can be held in 2027. But losing any of the justices could tilt the balance of the court, which is currently held 5-2 by Democrats. Because Roe’s fall means that state supreme courts now tend to have the last word on whether abortion laws are legal, spending in US judicial elections has soared. Pennsylvania’s intricate campaign-finance laws make it hard to track spending, but Douglas Keith, deputy director in the Brennan Center’s judiciary program, estimates that roughly $15m to $16m has already been poured into the Pennsylvania race. Much of that money has gone into ads trumpeting the court’s role in determining abortion rights. “The messaging in this race is nothing like what we saw in judicial elections before Dobbs,” Keith said, referring to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the supreme court case that overturned Roe. “You see it in TV ads from the groups supporting the justices and from the justices themselves. You see it in mailers.” The Pennsylvania supreme court has leapt into the abortion debate at least once in recent history: in 2024, the justices ruled that a state ban on using Medicaid to pay for abortions is sex-based discrimination and thus unconstitutional under Pennsylvania’s equal rights amendment. Virginia Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia, and Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former representative, are now vying to become the state’s first female governor. As the last state in the US south without a post-Roe abortion ban, Virginia has become a sanctuary for abortion clinics. Spanberger has backed Virginia’s current abortion laws, which permit the procedure until 27 weeks of pregnancy. She has also publicly championed an amendment to Virginia’s state constitution that would protect abortion rights, which has already passed state’s general assembly once. That amendment has to pass general assembly once more before voters can weigh in. As lieutenant governor, Earle-Sears is legally required to sign bills that the legislature passes, including the abortion rights amendment. But when she signed off on it, she added a handwritten note that read: “I am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child.” And during her 2021 race for her lieutenant governor seat, Earle-Sears said in an interview that she considered abortion “genocide” and wants to make abortion illegal except in cases where the mother’s life is in danger. In her lone debate with Spanberger, however, Earle-Sears said that her personal position on abortion doesn’t matter. “The commonwealth needs to come together and figure out where it wants to be,” Earle-Sears said. “It’s not going to be my view. It’s going to be the view of the majority.” All 100 seats in Virginia’s house of delegates are also up for grabs this year. In order to get the abortion rights amendment to voters in 2026, Democrats must hold onto their majority in the house. Recent polling showed Earle-Sears trailing Spanberger by seven points.","2025-11-03T11:00:33Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/abortion-election-state-explainer"
"abortion","Amy Coney Barrett defends US abortion ruling in memoir: ‘respected choice’","Amy Coney Barrett, the conservative supreme court justice whose controversial fast-track confirmation at the end of Donald Trump’s first presidency led directly to the panel’s vote to strike down abortion rights nationally, has expressed in a new memoir her belief that the ruling “respected the choice” of the American people. Barrett was paid a $2m advance for her book Listening to the Law, according to CNN, which obtained a copy and published brief extracts on Tuesday, a week before its 9 September publication. Her comments about the June 2022 decision that reversed the court’s 1973 Roe v Wade ruling guaranteeing the constitutional right to an abortion are certain to draw scrutiny – and criticism. “[T]he court’s role is to respect the choices that the people have agreed upon, not to tell them what they should agree to,” Barrett writes, according to CNN. The outlet framed Barrett’s comment as reflecting her belief that her predecessors’ 7-2 vote in Roe v Wade had “usurped the will of the American people”. In a May 2024 poll, however, more than 60% of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases. That percentage stood only four points lower in 2021, one year before Barrett joined the court’s four other ultraconservatives in removing national protections and leaving states to set their own abortion laws. Numerous states moved quickly to ban or severely restrict access to abortions, with legal proceedings still playing out in a number of others. According to the New York Times, 19 states have laws that either outlaw the procedure completely, or limit it to earlier in a pregnancy than the “fetal viability” standard of Roe v Wade. Barrett’s book, CNN said, also takes on religious bias and details her decision-making process. But she states at the outset that she would not reveal details of court deliberations about specific cases – or identify her seven children or other family members by name “for the sake of their privacy”. Barrett’s nomination and confirmation were rammed through the US Senate by the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, within weeks of the September death of the veteran liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It gave Trump his third supreme court pick and cemented an unassailable 6-3 conservative majority that has repeatedly ruled in his favor during his second presidency, which began in January, including landmark decisions expanding presidential power. Barrett’s confirmation, just eight days before the November 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden, stood in stark contrast to McConnell’s handling of the aftermath of the death of another conservative justice, Antonin Scalia, in February 2016. Then, McConnell celebrated his successful stalling of Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost a year, until Trump took office and replaced Scalia with Neil Gorsuch in April 2017. CNN said Barrett refers to Trump “only in passing” and states, dispassionately, that the court has always been entangled with its times. “While the intensity of the challenges faced by the Court ebbs and flows, the challenges themselves will never disappear,” Barrett is quoted as saying. “Throughout, the job of every justice is to do his or her best by the law.” Yet the book provides glimpses of life inside the court as the new Trump-shaped panel began to work together. After one “particularly tricky” opinion Barrett wrote, and other justices supported, staff in her chambers celebrated with champagne. Barrett was also dismissive of the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, who joined the chief justice, John Roberts, in opposing the majority abortion decision. Their dissent cited Ginsburg and declared that the 49 years of Roe v Wade being in effect “protected the liberty and equality of women” and guaranteed “government could not control a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life”. But Barrett, in her book, claims that the “complicated moral debate” about abortion distinguishes it from other rights more traditionally recognized as fundamental that enjoy broad public support, including “the rights to marry, have sex, procreate, use contraception”, CNN reported.","2025-09-02T14:42:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/amy-coney-barrett-memoir-abortion"
"abortion","Tennessee demands abortion data from hospitals in ban exceptions case","The Tennessee attorney general’s office has subpoenaed four medical groups in the state for records of abortions performed over the last several years as part of a lawsuit over the exceptions to the state’s near-total abortion ban, court documents obtained by the Guardian show. The four subpoenas were issued this spring to Vanderbilt University medical center and a Tennessee hospital run by the national Catholic chain Ascension, as well as two smaller medical practices in Tennessee, Heritage Medical Associates and the Women’s Group of Franklin. Although each subpoena is different, they broadly ask these organizations to turn over extensive information about instances in which they may have provided abortions, including the number of abortions performed since 2022 and, in some of the subpoenas, all “documents and communications” related to those abortions. When and if the medical providers turn in the records, they are legally allowed to preserve “all patient confidentiality as necessary”, according to the subpoenas. A protective order has also been issued to block the records from being used to investigate the hospitals and medical providers outside of the scope of the lawsuit, as well as to potentially mark even the anonymized patient records as “confidential”. The sweeping requests raise questions about red-state attempts to track abortion providers in a post-Roe v Wade US. In the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe, reproductive rights activists have grown increasingly concerned about government efforts to collect information on abortions, especially as states such as Louisiana and Texas have recently launched efforts to penalize abortion providers. Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the legal history of reproduction, shared her concerns that the Tennessee subpoenas could have “a tremendous chilling effect”. “Republican legislators have recognized that doctors are already not performing procedures that they – Republican legislators – say are justified under exceptions,” Ziegler said. “The message being sent here is that every single decision, even ones that would have been legal, then would be second-guessed.” The subpoenas were issued as part of a 2023 lawsuit brought by several Tennessee women and doctors who are seeking to broaden the exceptions in the state’s abortion ban. Although Tennessee – like every other state with an abortion ban – technically permits abortions in medical emergencies, these women say they were denied medically necessary abortions. Doctors across the country have said that the exceptions embedded in abortion bans are worded so vaguely that they are incompatible with medical standards, forcing doctors to delay or deny care until a patient becomes sick enough to legally qualify for treatment. At least five pregnant women have reportedly died under abortion bans in Georgia and Texas. In the years since Roe fell, more pregnant Texas women have also begun to be diagnosed with sepsis – a life-threatening condition – or almost bled to death after they miscarried, according to reporting by ProPublica. Lawyers for Tennessee, however, have said in court that the state’s abortion exceptions are workable as written. Some doctors’ failure to accurately interpret the law does not justify amending the state’s ban, Tennessee has argued, especially since the state legislature passed a bill in 2025 that sought to clarify the circumstances under which people can get abortions. The subpoenas issued to the medical providers ask them to turn over “all protocols, policies, guidelines, practice guides or handbooks” that they have used to determine whether patients can get abortions. The subpoena for Vanderbilt also demands records from the Nashville hospital’s abortion committee, which deliberates on whether and how to provide legal abortions to patients, including all “documents and communications” that may reveal the resolution of each case considered by the committee. The other subpoenas were issued to at least one medical practice that employs a Tennessee doctor who is a part of the lawsuit. They ask those practices to count the number of abortions they have performed since 2020, two years before Roe fell. They also ask for records from instances in which doctors did not provide abortions because they felt that the Tennessee ban blocked them from doing so. The subpoenaed groups and Tennessee attorney general’s office did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment. Despite the court protections in place to keep the subpoenaed records from leaking, assurances from state officials may not be enough to quell doctors’ fears of prosecution, Ziegler said. She pointed to the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia who was kept on life support until she delivered a baby via caesarean section in June. While Georgia’s attorney general said that the state’s near-total abortion ban did not force doctors to keep pregnant women on life support, Smith’s doctors reportedly felt that the language of the ban was so strict that they still had no choice but to keep her alive. “Prior to any of these data requests, a lot of physicians and providers were really anxious about civil or criminal liability,” Ziegler said. “I don’t see how this is going to help matters.”","2025-08-06T15:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/tennessee-abortion-data-ban"
"abortion","DoJ sues pro-Palestinian activists under law often used to protect abortion clinics","The Trump administration has filed a first-of-its-kind civil rights lawsuit against pro-Palestinian groups and activists, accusing the advocates of violating a law that has traditionally been used to protect reproductive health clinics from anti-abortion harassment and violence. The lawsuit, filed on Monday by the justice department’s civil rights division, alleges that two advocacy groups and six people broke the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act when they protested against an event at a West Orange, New Jersey, synagogue in November 2024. The event at the Ohr Torah synagogue promoted the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are widely considered illegal under international law. Similar events have sparked protests in the years since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, but this event escalated into violence. One man, a pro-Israel counterprotester, pepper-sprayed a pro-Palestinian demonstrator, while another counterprotester bashed the same demonstrator in the head with a flashlight, according to a local news outlet. Local New Jersey prosecutors ultimately filed charges against the two counterprotestors on multiple counts, including aggravated assault. (The pair have denied the accusations against them.) The lawsuit filed by the Trump administration portrays the pro-Palestinian advocates as the aggressors. It alleges that some of the advocates physically assaulted at least one pro-Israel protester, effectively used vuvuzelas “as weapons” – arguing that the horns are “reasonably known to lead to permanent noise-induced hearing loss” – and ultimately disrupted both a memorial service and a lecture on the Torah. “These violent protesters meant their actions for evil, but we will use this case to bring forth good: the protection of all Americans’ religious liberty,” Harmeet K Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the justice department’s civil rights division, said in a press conference on Monday. The Trump administration is asking a court to fine the pro-Palestinian demonstrators more than $30,000 for their first violation of the Face Act, and roughly $50,000 for each subsequent violation. One of the groups named in the lawsuit, American Muslims for Palestine-New Jersey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The national branch of another group, the Party for Socialism and Liberation-New Jersey, also did not immediately respond. The other defendants could not be immediately reached for comment. The Face Act penalizes people who go beyond peaceful protest to threaten, obstruct or injure someone who is trying to access a reproductive health clinic or “place of religious worship”, but the federal government has never used the act to protect houses of worship, Dhillon confirmed during the press conference. Instead, it has historically been used to guard abortion clinics, since former president Bill Clinton signed the 1994 bill into law amid unprecedented violence against abortion providers and clinics. The Face Act is so unpopular among anti-abortion advocates that Republicans have repeatedly called for its repeal. For Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California’s Davis School of Law, the new case is especially striking because the Trump administration announced earlier this year that it would dramatically curtail its use of the Face Act to protect abortion clinics. Donald Trump has also pardoned several anti-abortion protesters who had been convicted under the Face Act. “It probably feels like a slap in the face to people who support reproductive rights,” said Ziegler, who studies the legal history of reproduction. “The administration has said it’s open season when it comes to the Face Act and reproductive health clinics – but is being pretty aggressive in enforcing it when it comes to places of worship.” Ziegler also sees this use of the Face Act as a means of bigfooting local prosecutors in blue states – and, potentially, cracking down on protests writ large. “If you’re the Trump administration and you want to shut down pro-Palestinian protests altogether, reaching for the Face Act makes sense,” Ziegler said. “The reason the Face Act was put into place is because people were worried that clinic blockades were dangerous and were leading to violence – and, more importantly, because other criminal laws weren’t getting the job done. So the Trump administration is looking to a federal law with steeper penalties probably for a similar reason.”","2025-09-30T19:41:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/trump-justice-department-palestinian-activists"
"abortion","RFK Jr hints access to key abortion drug could be cut back","The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has suggested that Biden-era regulations expanding access to abortion pills could be rolled back because the Biden administration had “twisted the data” behind the pills. Kennedy made the remark more than an hour into a tense interrogation by members of the US Senate judiciary committee over his chaotic tenure at the health department, which has been marked by thousands of layoffs and the promotion of leaders with little background in public health and medicine. Kennedy did not back up the accusation, which runs counter to more than three decades of research. More than 100 studies, conducted across dozens of countries, have found that mifepristone and misoprostol, the abortion pills typically used in the United States, are a safe and effective way to end a pregnancy. The comment came when James Lankford, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, asked Kennedy whether the Trump administration intended to reverse the Biden-era changes to access to mifepristone. In 2016 and 2021, the FDA rewrote its regulations of the drug to allow healthcare providers other than doctors to prescribe it and to make it easier for patients to receive mifepristone through telemedicine. “You’d said there would be a review on that, just to be able to look at it, make sure we’re following all safety protocols,” Lankford said. “Do you know a timing on that review?” “I can’t give you an exact timing,” Kennedy said, adding that he had talked to FDA commissioner Marty Makary about the issue. “We’re getting data in all the time. New data that we’re reviewing. And we know that during the Biden administration, they actually twisted the data to bury one of the safety signals, a very high safety signal, around 11%,” Kennedy said. “We’re gonna make sure that doesn’t happen any more.” Kennedy appeared to be referring to an analysis published in an April paper by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing thinktank, that claimed almost 11% of women experience sepsis, hemorrhaging or other serious complications within 45 days of taking mifepristone. Experts have found multiple flaws in the analysis, which was not peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – wherein an embryo implants somewhere outside of the uterine lining – as a serious complication, but mifepristone neither causes nor worsens ectopic pregnancies. Nevertheless, anti-abortion groups have used that analysis as fodder to target abortion pills, which have become a major avenue of abortion access in the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Other parts of Kennedy’s testimony were also marred by inaccuracies. Later in the hearing, Kennedy claimed: “For the first time in 20 years today, we learned that infant mortality has increased in our country. It’s not because I came in here. It’s because of what happened in the Biden administration – that we will end.” Infant mortality in the US spiked for the first time in 2022, not 2025, according to the Commonwealth Fund. At least part of that spike is likely due to the emergence of abortion bans, particularly in Texas, which outlawed virtually all abortions in 2021. Numerous studies have linked abortion bans – which are now in effect in more than a dozen states and have been championed by Republicans – to rising infant deaths, as they can require women carrying nonviable pregnancy to give birth to infants who do not survive.","2025-09-04T18:36:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/trump-rfk-mifepristone-abortion-pill"
"abortion","Republican representative’s ectopic pregnancy clashes with Florida abortion law","A Florida Republican congresswoman is blaming fearmongering on the left for the reluctance of hospital staff to give her the drugs she needed to end an ectopic pregnancy that threatened her life. Kat Cammack went to the emergency room in May 2024 where it was estimated she was five weeks into an ectopic pregnancy, there was no heartbeat and her life was at risk. Doctors determined she needed a shot of methotrexate to help expel her pregnancy but since Florida’s six-week abortion ban had just taken effect medical staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did. Cammack looked up the state law on her phone to show staff and even attempted to contact the governor’s office. Hours later, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication. Abortion rights activists say the law created problems. Florida regulators say ectopic pregnancies are not abortions and are exempt from restrictions, but Molly Duane, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the Wall Street Journal the law does not define ectopic pregnancy, which can be difficult to diagnose. Alison Haddock, the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, told the outlet care in early pregnancy is a “medically complicated space” and that doctors in abortion-restricted states worry “whether their clinical judgment will stand should there be any prosecution”. Cammack, who opposes abortion and co-chairs the House pro-life caucus, told the Wall Street Journal she blames messaging from pro-choice groups who have created fear of criminal charges for delaying her treatment, which is not banned under Florida’s restrictive statutes. Over a year later and once again pregnant and due to give birth soon, Cammack says the politics of the incident have stuck with her. “It was absolute fearmongering at its worst,” Cammack told the publication, but acknowledged that abortion rights groups might interpret her experience differently and blame Republican-led, restrictive anti-abortion laws for the issue. “There will be some comments like, ‘Well, thank God we have abortion services,’ even though what I went through wasn’t an abortion,” she told the outlet. Florida’s strict abortion ban, which took effect on 1 May 2024, makes abortions illegal after six weeks, when most people are not even aware yet that they are pregnant. After months in which medical staff were concerned that the law’s wording made emergency procedures illegal, the state’s healthcare agency issued official guidance to “address misinformation” on permitting an abortion in instances where the pregnant person’s life and health are in danger. Cammack said she hoped that going public with her experience would help opposing political groups find common ground. “I would stand with any woman – Republican or Democrat – and fight for them to be able to get care in a situation where they are experiencing a miscarriage and an ectopic” pregnancy, she said.","2025-06-22T22:21:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/22/kat-cammack-republican-florida-abortion-law-ectopic-pregnancy"
"abortion","Trump officials look to block abortion services at veterans affairs hospitals","The Trump administration is seeking to block veterans from receiving abortions at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy has imperiled their health, according to new paperwork filed by the administration. The administration is seeking to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VA to counsel veterans and their eligible family members about abortion, as well as offer the procedure to veterans in limited circumstances, even in states that banned abortion after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. At the time, veterans affairs secretary Denis McDonough called the move a “patient safety decision”. More than a dozen states ban virtually all abortions. As of 2024, more than half of female veterans live in states that ban abortion or are likely to, according to the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families. However, in a Friday filing in the federal register, the Trump administration said that the Biden-era policy was “legally questionable” and out of step with congressional actions that limited the VA’s ability to provide abortions. Anti-abortion activists have spent years advocating against federal funding for abortion access of any kind. Due to their efforts, it is already illegal to use federal dollars to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency. In its filing, the administration said that, despite the rollback, veterans who are undergoing miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies – which are nonviable pregnancies in which an embryo implants outside of the uterus – would still be able to receive care. Veterans would also be able to get abortions “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. (The Department of Veterans Affairs did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.) However, the administration’s assurances may face practical hurdles in states that outlaw abortion. Since Roe fell, dozens of women have said that they were denied medically necessary abortions, despite the fact that abortion bans typically permit abortions in situations where a person’s health or life is under threat. Doctors have also said that, because abortion bans are worded so ambiguously, they are often unsure if or when they can step in to end dangerous pregnancies. Instead, doctors have been forced to delay care until patients get sick enough that they can legally intervene. “Those who fight for all our freedom must have the most basic freedom to control their own bodies and futures – and this rule robs them of it,” Alexis McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement on Monday. “Taking away access to heath care shows us that the Trump administration will always put politics and retribution over people’s lives.” The rollback of the Biden-era policy has not yet been finalized. The public has until early September to comment on the Trump administration’s proposal.","2025-08-04T21:56:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals"
"abortion","Abortion pill manufacturer asks to join suit that could rewrite US abortion access","The manufacturer of the generic version of a major abortion pill has asked to join a federal lawsuit over the pill’s future, marking a new step forward in litigation that could rewrite US abortion access. The manufacturer, GenBioPro, filed court papers on Monday to become a defendant in the lawsuit over mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in a US medication abortion. That lawsuit, which was brought by the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Missouri and Kansas, seeks to reverse FDA regulations that dramatically expanded access to the pill, such as provisions that permit providers to prescribe it through telehealth. Medication abortions account for more than 60% of US abortions. Last year, tens of thousands of them were provided through telehealth, including to women living in states with abortion bans, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. “Despite the overwhelming majority of Americans – including constituents of these attorneys general – supporting the legal right to abortion, these politicians remain determined to severely restrict access to a critical drug that women across America depend on,” Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. Lawyers from Democracy Forward are serving on GenBioPro’s legal team. Perryman continued: “Their baseless attacks not only jeopardize the availability of mifepristone, but also threaten the integrity of our nation’s drug regulation system.” The lawsuit is a continuation of a case that reached the US supreme court last year. It was first brought by an anti-abortion coalition known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. In a 9-0 ruling, the justices found that the coalition lacked the legal standing to bring the case and sent it back to a lower court. However, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the northern district of Texas, ruled in January that the attorneys general from Idaho, Missouri and Kansas could continue the case for now. Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by Donald Trump, had in the earlier version of the case issued a court order that would yank mifepristone from the market entirely. That order was frozen by higher courts. Under Joe Biden, the FDA defended itself against the lawsuit and argued in favor of maintaining the FDA’s current regulation of the drug. Under Trump, however, the FDA is widely expected to drop out of the case. Danco Laboratories, which manufactures mifepristone under the brand name Mifeprex, is already a defendant in the suit. More than 100 studies, conducted across decades and dozens of countries, have found that mifepristone and misoprostol, the second drug normally used in US abortions, are safe. Other states, meanwhile, are taking aim at providers’ ability to dispense abortion pills across state lines.

"abortion","Texas threatens to sue organizations and doctor for increasing abortion pill access","The heated US war over abortion pills warmed up another degree on Wednesday, as the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sent cease-and-desist letters to two organizations and an individual that he accused of mailing abortion pills to Texans or facilitating their shipment. Paxton threatened to sue if they do not stop their alleged activities. “These abortion drug organizations and radical activists are not above the law, and I have ordered the immediate end of this unlawful conduct,” Paxton said in a news release announcing the letters. The state of Texas bans virtually all abortions. Paxton sent the letters to Plan C, a website that provides information about how to obtain abortion pills; Her Safe Harbor, an organization that provides abortions through telemedicine; and Rémy Coeytaux, a doctor who has been accused of mailing abortion pills to a Texan. Debra Lynch, a nurse practitioner who works with Her Safe Harbor, said that Paxton’s letter would not stop the organization from sending abortion pills to people. If anything, Lynch suggested, it would spur the group on. “None of our providers are primarily concerned with our own wellbeing or our own legal status,” Lynch said. “All the horrors that women are facing because of these ridiculous bans and restrictions outweigh anything that could possibly happen to us as providers, in terms of a fine or a lawsuit or even jail time, if it were to come to that.” Lynch said that in the hours after news of Paxton’s letter broke, Her Safe Harbor received more than 150 requests from Texans who were afraid about abortion access and want to obtain pills that they may use in the future. Normally, Her Safe Harbor has around four to five providers taking calls from patients. Now, they plan to have at least 10 working “until this wave of fear subsides”. Neither Plan C nor Coeytaux immediately replied to the Guardian’s request for comment. In the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and unleashed a wave of state-level abortion bans, abortions have surged in the United States. This rise is due in large part to the availability of abortion pills and the emergence of “shield laws”, which have been enacted by a handful of blue states and aim to protect abortion providers who mail pills across state lines from out-of-state prosecution. By the end of 2024, clinicians working through shield laws were facilitating an average of 12,330 abortions per month, according to data from #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. Enraged by this development, anti-abortion advocates have in recent months stepped up their campaign to crush abortion pill providers. In his cease-and-desist letters, Paxton – a Republican who is running to become a US senator – repeatedly cited the Comstock Act of 1873, an anti-vice law that bans the mailing of abortion-related materials. Although legal experts have long regarded the Comstock Act as a dead letter, several anti-abortion activists now believe that the fall of Roe has left the federal government free to fully enforce the act. Alongside 15 other state attorneys general, Paxton earlier this summer signed onto a letter imploring Congress to pass a law that would pre-empt states’ shield laws. He has also sued a New York-based doctor whom he accused of mailing abortion pills into Texas. Then, after a New York county court official said that the state’s shield law prohibited New York from enforcing a fine against the doctor, Paxton sued the official. Paxton’s cease-and-desist letters also follow similar letters sent by the Arkansas attorney general, Republican Tim Griffin. In July, Griffin sent a cease-and-desist letter to Possibility Labs, the parent company of Plan C, and to Mayday Medicines, the parent company of Mayday Health. Like Plan C, Mayday Health offers information about abortion pills, but does not directly sell them. Other anti-abortion activists are going after abortion providers through other legal avenues. A Texas man who said that Coeytaux supplied abortion pills to aid his female partner’s abortion has also sued Coeytaux in a federal wrongful death lawsuit. The man is being represented in court by Jonathan Mitchell, an anti-abortion attorney who masterminded a six-week abortion ban that took effect in Texas in 2021. Last week, Mitchell filed another federal wrongful death lawsuit against a different abortion provider.","2025-08-20T19:32:26Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/texas-abortion-pills"
"abortion","Texas man sues doctor for allegedly supplying abortion pills to girlfriend","A Texas man has filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against a doctor who, he says, supplied abortion pills to his girlfriend. In the lawsuit, which was filed in Texas on Sunday, Jerry Rodriguez alleges that the doctor, Remy Coeytaux, mailed the pills to Texas, where virtually all abortions are outlawed. Rodriguez’s girlfriend then allegedly used the pills to end two pregnancies. Coeytaux not only broke a series of Texas anti-abortion laws, the lawsuit alleges, but also a 19th-century federal anti-vice law known as the Comstock Act. That act bans the mailing of abortion-related materials, but has been unenforced for decades, its scope narrowed by laws and court rulings – including Roe v Wade, which has since been overturned – that came into effect in the 20th century. “Assisting a self-managed abortion in Texas is an act of murder,” the lawsuit alleges. Although Rodriguez’s girlfriend, the lawsuit continued, “cannot be charged with murder for her role in killing her unborn child, immunity does not shield Coeytaux from liability for aiding or abetting or directly participating in the murder”. Rodriguez is seeking damages against Coeytaux as well as an injunction that would forbid Coeytaux from mailing abortion pills across state lines. Rodriguez wants that injunction, he said in his lawsuit, “on behalf of a class of all current and future fathers of unborn children in the United States”. Rodriguez also claims the injunction is necessary because his girlfriend is allegedly pregnant again, and he fears her husband – from whom she is separated – may urge her to have another abortion. His girlfriend’s previous abortions were also at her estranged husband’s convincing, according to Rodriguez’s lawsuit. This lawsuit marks the latest attempt by anti-abortion activists to target the mailing of abortion pills, which have become a major avenue of abortion access in the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe, and to revive enforcement of the Comstock Act. In December, Texas sued Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor, over allegations that she violated Texas law by mailing abortion pills to a Texas woman. In January, a Louisiana grand jury criminally indicted Carpenter over accusations that she mailed a pill to that state, too. Anti-abortion activists’ have been urging men who are angry about their female partners’ abortions to come forward and launch litigation. However, because the Carpenter lawsuit was ultimately filed by the office of Ken Paxton, the Texas Republican attorney general, experts believe it may be fatally hobbled by a quirk of US constitutional law. Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis, law school professor who studies the legal history of reproduction, has told the Guardian that while the US constitution forces states to recognize fines levied in lawsuits between people, it does not necessarily do the same for fines that result from lawsuits that have been brought by states. Because Rodriguez is suing as an individual, his lawsuit may sidestep that hurdle. Coeytaux declined to comment on the litigation. According to his LinkedIn profile, Coeytaux is based in California, where abortion remains legal, and which has a “shield law” in place to protect abortion providers who mail abortion pills across state lines. They have never been put to the test in court. Rodriguez is being represented in his lawsuit by Jonathan Mitchell, an attorney who masterminded a six-week abortion ban that went into effect in Texas in 2021. Although Roe was still the law of the land when the ban took effect, it withstood legal scrutiny because of its unique design: rather than being enforced by the state, it deputized people to sue one another over suspected illegal abortions.","2025-07-23T21:10:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/texas-man-sues-doctor-abortion-pills"
"abortion","Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Hastie rebuked for ‘playing politics’ on abortion in debate on stillbirth leave","A group of Coalition parliamentarians, including Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Hastie, have seized on a proposed new law to give paid parental leave to parents of a child who is stillborn or dies, arguing it should not be available to anyone needing a late-term abortion. A senior doctor has labelled the comments as “terrible, cynical, awful” things to say about an often heartbreaking decision, as experts point out that the vast majority of later terminations are forced by major health issues and warn fearmongering about the issue is straight out of the anti-abortion handbook. Federal parliament has been debating “Priya’s law”, an amendment to the Fair Work Act, which would protect employer-funded paid parental leave for parents of a child who is stillborn or dies. The bill has bipartisan support but a quartet of conservative Coalition members – Joyce, Hastie and Liberal MPs Tony Pasin and Henry Pike – gave speeches to parliament backing the broad intention of the change but raising reservations about whether paid parental leave would apply to parents who undergo a late-term abortion. “A number of us feel we do not have a clear answer on this, so, unfortunately – I hate to bring it up – there remains the issue of late-term abortion. We have a right to know if it includes that,” Joyce said. Hastie, a Liberal leadership aspirant, praised the bill’s “noble” intent but said “I do have a question about the unintended consequences of this bill and it applies to late-term abortions … It’s no secret that I am opposed to late-term abortions.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Pasin said he was concerned the bill would “treat an intentionally late-term aborted child in the same way as it would a natural stillbirth or a baby who dies shortly after birth”. “I think it’s clear in the title ‘paid parental leave’ that it should be available to parents and that it should be available to people who had wished to become parents but for the grace of God have not become parents through an incident or outcome – but it shouldn’t be available to people who don’t wish to become parents,” he said. Academics and doctors have accused those politicians of “a lack of understanding” about stillbirth. “Losing a baby after 20 weeks is losing a baby. We should treat anyone who loses a baby with compassion, instead of playing politics with people’s emotions and people’s distress,” said Dr Nisha Khot, the president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog), adding that she thought the comments were “terrible, cynical, awful”. Greg Johnson, the managing director of abortion provider MSI Australia, urged parliamentarians to debate the legislation with “empathy and respect for the facts”. “We are seeing a troubling trend of American-style abortion politics being imported into Australia,” he said. “It’s not coming from moderate voices but from a small group on the right seeking to politicise a deeply personal issue. It should stop. “Misrepresenting abortion care not only causes distress to families and clinicians, it undermines compassion for those who experience loss or complex pregnancies.” Kirsten Black, a professor of sexual and reproductive health at the University of Sydney, said people were “very rarely terminating a pregnancy after 20 weeks that’s not wanted”. “Ninety-nine per cent of abortions occur before 20 weeks,” she said. “We’re talking about 1% of abortions anyway and the absolute vast majority [of those] are done for medical reasons.” Black said later-term abortions were still very distressing for parents. “That most losses of pregnancies after 20 weeks are wanted, and they may occur in the presence of genetic syndromes or major foetal abnormality or situations where continuing pregnancy would severely harm the mother’s mental or physical health,” she said. Speaking in the debate on “Priya’s law”, the Labor MP Jerome Laxale said the bill was “about fixing a loophole in a law identified by her grieving parents”. “It is not about anything else. It is not about a culture war.” The shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, said the Coalition remained committed to supporting the bill and in a press conference declined to endorse or repeat the claims from her colleagues. “We maintain absolute bipartisan support to make sure that mothers who have stillborn children, who have lost their child soon after birth, get the same consideration for somebody who has a child,” she said. Asked whether she held the same reservations as Joyce and Hastie, Ruston replied: “I think this bill is about something completely different and I’m very focused on making sure that we keep our bipartisan commitment to Priya’s mother.” Prudence Flowers, a Flinders University senior lecturer who looks at the importation of anti-abortion tactics from the United States, said the focus on later gestation abortions was a US tactic and the “thin edge of the wedge”. “The idea is to generate disgust and revulsion towards abortion more generally as a procedure and to use that to chip away at rights,” she said.","2025-10-30T14:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/30/abortion-stillbirth-leave-barnaby-joyce-andrew-hastie-playing-politics"
"abortion","The abortion pill is safe. But why should Trump let facts get in the way?","Robert F Kennedy Jr’s health department is conducting a new review of mifepristone, the drug used in the majority of American abortions, claiming that a new study from a conservative thinktank has raised concerns about its safety. Mifepristone, which was approved by the FDA 25 years ago this month, has repeatedly been proven safe and effective for use terminating pregnancies in both multiple medical trials and in widespread patient use over the past quarter of a century. The report cited by Kennedy, meanwhile, comes from the Ethics and Public Policy Center – a group that applies “the Jewish and Christian traditions” to modern law and pushes back “against the extreme progressive agenda while building a consensus for conservatives” – and was not peer reviewed. The study has been heavily criticized by medical experts for its methodology and lack of transparency regarding how it obtained and analyzed its data. The report appears to have dramatically inflated the rate of serious adverse health outcomes in patients who took mifepristone – in part by seemingly conflating the bleeding that occurs in the normal course of a medication abortion with hemorrhaging, and in part by relying on unclear terminology. The Ethics and Public Policy Center report classified “serious adverse events” as occurring in almost 11% of mifepristone patients. More reliable studies, subject to data transparency, peer review, and a more rigorously honest set of definitions, have found that such adverse health events happen in fewer than 0.5% of users. In a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies, the vast majority found that more than 99% of people who use mifepristone have no serious complications. Mifepristone is safe. But why let the facts get in the way of the Trump administration’s political agenda? The review of mifepristone marks the second time in less than a week that the Trump administration has marshalled false medical claims and junk science in an effort to constrain the freedoms of pregnant women and curtail their access to relief. On Monday, in a bizarre, rambling and frequently nonsensical press conference, the president appeared alongside Kennedy Jr to claim, falsely, that Tylenol use during pregnancy can cause autism in the resulting children, and to instruct pregnant women to avoid the painkiller and instead “tough it out”. The Trump administration has long been under pressure from the anti-abortion movement – which, not satisfied by the end of Roe v Wade (in a decision delivered to them by Trump’s appointees, hand-selected for the purpose), has continually pushed the administration to further limit access to abortion. Donald Trump has seemed unwilling to directly attack abortion, appearing to think that the issue is a political loser for him. But his administration has already curtailed access nationwide. His massive domestic spending bill included a provision barring most abortion providers from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any services they provide – abortion related or not – for a year, a move that makes it dramatically more expensive for clinics to offer abortion services. As a result, clinics are already shutting their doors in Democratically-controlled states like California. In Wisconsin, where the battle for abortion legalization led to a fantastically expensive state supreme court race and massive voter mobilization, the state Planned Parenthood affiliate made the decision to stop providing abortions in order to retain access to the Medicaid funding they need to stay open – even though that enormous political effort succeeded in re-legalizing abortion in the state. But that’s not enough for the anti-choice right. Three Republican-controlled states – Missouri, Idaho and Kansas – are suing the FDA, seeking to reverse changes to mifepristone regulations that allowed the drug to be prescribed via telemedicine and sent through the mail, and to restore other restrictions on the drug. Texas, Florida and Louisiana are seeking to join and expand that lawsuit to further restrict mifepristone. The new regulations, which have been endorsed by leading health experts, have made mifepristone dramatically more accessible in the years since the Dobbs decision, as women living in states that ban abortion seek out ways to have the medication prescribed and mailed to them by physicians abroad or in Democratically controlled states. Kennedy’s move against mifepristone could restrict access even further. Compared with surgery, the pill is a more accessible, safer and less resource-intensive way for clinics to provide abortions. It does not require a surgical room or very much of a provider’s time; patients can take the pills and have their abortions in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. Getting rid of the abortion pill, or making it harder to access, would put even more strain on abortion providers who are already having a difficult time keeping their heads above water. Even more tragically, the move could be devastating for women’s health and lives. In the pre-Roe era, when abortion was illegal and mifepristone had not yet been invented, many women in need of abortions sought out surgical procedures on the black market. But surgery is much riskier than taking a pill, and many of these women experienced injuries and infections that killed or permanently maimed them. There is exactly one reason why the US has not yet seen a return to those bad old days of unsafe surgical abortions and mass female death: that reason is mifepristone. The drug saves women’s dreams and dignity by allowing them to control their own reproduction; it saves their lives by allowing them to avoid a dangerous surgery in an illegal market. Even in liberal states, abortion has become much harder to access than it was before Dobbs; that alone is an injury to women’s citizenship and status. With mifepristone under threat, it looks like the Trump administration is threatening their lives, too.

"abortion","Abortion drug could help reduce risk of breast cancer, group of medics says","A drug used in medical abortions could help prevent women at high risk of breast cancer from developing the disease, according to an international group of doctors and scientists. However, “stigma” around mifepristone is stopping pharmaceutical companies from investigating its potential as a new treatment doctors could offer to reduce the risk of breast cancer, they say. Companies appear reluctant to carry out trials despite the fact that three previous studies all found that the drug shows promise as a way of slowing down the growth of cancerous cells. Mifepristone’s role in medical abortions and fact that access to abortion is restricted in some countries is preventing much-needed research being done, the experts claim. It is one of two drugs, alongside misoprostol, that women in the UK take when ending a pregnancy that began up to 10 weeks earlier. They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for 24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol. “It is deeply disappointing that the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’s Health says. All are experts in reproductive health or reproductive cancer working in London, Edinburgh, Stockholm and Erbil in Iraq. “The time is long overdue to give mifepristone the opportunity it deserves to be investigated as a non-surgical option for primary prevention [of breast cancer],” they add. Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in most countries in the world and kills an estimated 670,000 women globally every year, according to the World Health Organization. Although small-scale, the three previous studies offered evidence mifepristone can limit the effect of the hormone progesterone, which drives the cell growth found in breast cancer. They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024. Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator. If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say. UK cancer charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion. Dr Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: “More risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to achieve this. “So early research into mifepristone is an important step forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and effective.” Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent the disease”. She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably. Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer. “But we need more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would benefit most from it.” Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively researched for prevention of breast cancer. “Taken together, our data support the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for two or three months.”","2025-08-14T22:30:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/14/abortion-drug-could-help-reduce-risk-of-breast-cancer-group-of-medics-says"
"abortion","The Guardian view on abortion prosecutions: decriminalisation can’t wait","The Crown Prosecution Service has yet to explain why it thought that pursuing a case against Nicola Packer was in the public interest. Thankfully, jurors last week cleared the 45-year-old of illegally terminating her pregnancy. But more than four years of police and criminal proceedings have had a lasting impact on a woman already traumatised by discovering that she was 26 weeks pregnant, not about 10, when she acted. The trial dragged her private life – even her sexual preferences – into the public eye. Understandably, she called it “humiliating”. But it is prosecutors who should feel shame. Ms Packer was prescribed abortion pills in a remote consultation, due to a Covid lockdown. Prosecutors alleged that she deliberately breached the abortion time limit. Jurors believed Ms Packer, who said that she was horrified to realise how advanced her pregnancy was when she saw the foetus and that she “wouldn’t have put the baby or myself through it” had she known. Her case is an extreme one, but part of a growing trend. About 100 women are believed to have been investigated for possible illegal abortions in the last five years, with five cases coming to court in 2023. Before then, only three women were thought to have been prosecuted since abortion was made illegal in 1861. The judgment of the CPS was appalling. But the underlying issue is the criminalisation of abortion. The 1967 Abortion Act did not repeal the Victorian law but created exemptions under set conditions, leading to the wide availability of the procedure. The remote prescription of pills for early abortions has more recently expanded access. Many campaigners and politicians have been reluctant to re-open the abortion issue for fear the debate could be exploited and lead to reduced availability, for example through pressure to lower the term limit, now 24 weeks apart from in exceptional circumstances. Abortion’s legality, and the conditions of its availability, are distinct though related issues. But the surge in investigations, along with the influx of money and influence from anti-abortion activists invigorated by their triumph in the US, have persuaded many people that legislative change is now necessary. Medical opinion has swung decisively behind decriminalisation. More than 30 organisations – including the British Medical Association and the royal colleges of midwives, obstetricians and gynaecologists, nurses and GPs – have condemned the “trauma and cruelty” caused by the law and said that abortion should be simply a healthcare matter. In Canada, where abortion has been legal for more than three decades, rates have been stable and the proportion of later abortions has fallen. Criminalising the rare women who obtain abortions after the term limit, often vulnerable individuals in difficult circumstances, is unlikely to deter such cases. But it may deter them – and other women who have acted near the term limit or have miscarried naturally – from seeking medical help. MPs have already decriminalised abortion in Northern Ireland. In coming weeks, they have the opportunity to do so in the rest of the UK, thanks to two amendments tabled to the policing bill by Labour backbenchers. The first, from Tonia Antoniazzi, has widespread backing, including from more than 50 MPs across parties. Stella Creasy believes her alternative amendment would ensure that decriminalisation did not open the door to abortion access being tightened via secondary legislation in future. MPs may well be concerned, however, that it raises constitutional issues, and this additional complexity could deter them from backing change. The choice between two amendments, introduced with the best intentions, must not hole the campaign for decriminalisation. MPs must coalesce to push through change. There must be no more Nicola Packers. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"abortion","South Carolina supreme court upholds six-week abortion ban","South Carolina’s state supreme court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban in a decision issued on Wednesday, in a disappointing loss for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which operates clinics in South Carolina, sued over the state’s abortion ban, which outlaws the procedure after the emergence of a “fetal heartbeat”. Generally, these kinds of “heartbeat” bans have been interpreted to prohibit abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, when providers can detect cardiac activity from a fetus. But because a fetus’s heart is not formed until nine weeks of pregnancy, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic argued that such activity does not constitute a real “heartbeat”. Instead of outlawing abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, the reproductive health organization said, South Carolina should permit the procedure until nine weeks. The South Carolina supreme court rejected that argument. Legislators, the justices wrote in a 5-0 ruling, clearly intended for the law to ban abortion after six weeks. “We count at least sixty separate instances during the 2023 legislative session in which a member of the House or Senate referred to the 2023 Act as a six-week ban on abortion,” Justice John Few wrote in the majority opinion. Few added: “In particular, we could find not one instance during the entire 2023 legislative session in which anyone connected in any way to the General Assembly framed the Act as banning abortion after approximately nine weeks.” Abortion is banned at six weeks of pregnancy or at conception throughout the south-eastern US. South Carolina and Planned Parenthood South Atlantic are also at the center of another legal dispute around abortion. Last month, the US supreme court heard arguments in a case over South Carolina’s attempt to kick the group out of its state Medicaid program because Planned Parenthood provides abortion. If the supreme court sides with South Carolina, its decision could pave the way for other red states to cut Planned Parenthood out of their Medicaid programs – and financially devastate the organization.","2025-05-14T17:28:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/14/south-carolina-abortion-ban-ruling"
"abortion","Texas woman files wrongful death suit saying she was dosed with abortion pills","A Texas woman has sued a man she says dosed her with abortion pills against her will as well as the provider who she says supplied the pills. The woman, Julia, whose name has been changed for privacy, on Monday filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against the telemedicine abortion service Aid Access and its founder, Dr Rebecca Gomperts, as well as a man, John (whose name has also been changed), a US marine who Julia said impregnated her and subsequently dosed her with abortion pills. Julia is being represented in the lawsuit by Jonathan Mitchell, a lawyer who masterminded the Texas six-week abortion ban and has become one of the major architects of anti-abortion strategy in the post-Roe v Wade era. Mitchell has represented men in lawsuits who have sued abortion providers after accusing their female partners of undergoing abortions against their wishes, but this case is thought to be the first of its kind with a female plaintiff. After Julia revealed her pregnancy to John, he repeatedly pressured her to get an abortion and went so far as to order abortion pills online from Aid Access, a service that ships abortion pills to all 50 US states, according to Julia’s lawsuit, which includes extensive screenshots of texts between John and Julia. When Julia refused to take the pills, John allegedly browbeat her and suggested that he testify against Julia in her ongoing divorce proceeding against her ex-husband. Julia told John that her ex-husband had physically and emotionally abused both Julia and her three children, the lawsuit alleges. Then, in April 2025, John proposed that he come over to Julia’s house for a “trust building night”, according to the lawsuit. While Julia stepped outside to let her dog in, John allegedly dissolved at least 10 abortion pills into her hot chocolate. Typically, US abortions consist of two drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol. While mifepristone is usually swallowed, misoprostol is meant to dissolve slowly in the vagina, under the tongue or in the cheeks. Soon afterward, Julia began cramping and bleeding, her lawsuit alleges. John said that he would pick up Julia’s mother, so that she could watch Julia’s children while they went to the emergency room. However, John did not return. Julia then allegedly discovered the box of mifepristone that John had ordered from Aid Access, which John had left at her house. The box was empty. Julia also allegedly found an orange pill bottle containing both mifepristone and misoprostol pills. She rushed to the ER but ended up miscarrying eight weeks into her pregnancy. There is no medical test that can determine whether abortion pills, if taken orally, caused the end of a pregnancy. The lawsuit, which was previously reported by Autonomy News, is now seeking “nominal, compensatory, and punitive damages”. In addition to accusing John, Aid Access and Gomperts of violating multiple laws in Texas – where virtually all abortions are banned – it alleges that the trio also violated the federal Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that outlaws the mailing of abortion-related materials. Legal experts long regarded the Comstock Act as a dead letter, since Roe v Wade kept its ban on abortion-related materials from taking effect for decades. However, since the US supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, anti-abortion advocates such as Mitchell say it can now be revived. They have repeatedly cited the Comstock Act in lawsuits, in the hope that courts will decide to let it take full effect. Aid Access, Gomperts and the US marines did not respond to a request for comment. Reached by phone, John said he had no comment on the lawsuit. Telemedicine groups including Aid Access are currently mailing abortion pills through the use of “shield laws”, which have been enacted in a handful of blue states since Roe fell. These laws, which aim to protect abortion providers from facing civil and criminal liability if they mail pills to people who live in states that ban abortion, have proven critical to post-Roe abortion provision, as abortion pills make up an increasing share of all US abortions. Between 2023 and 2024, Aid Access shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents, according to a new study released on Monday. However, shield laws have not been tested in court. Recently, Texas sued a New York court official for refusing to fine a New York-based abortion provider, as the official had said that New York’s shield law blocked him from enforcing the fine.","2025-08-11T20:40:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/texas-lawsuit-abortion-pill"
"abortion","MPs vote to decriminalise abortion in step forward for reproductive rights","British MPs have voted to decriminalise abortion, marking the biggest step forward in reproductive rights in almost 60 years. In an amendment to the government’s crime and policing bill, parliament voted to change the criminal laws that govern abortion in England and Wales so that women procuring a termination outside the legal framework cannot be prosecuted. The framework of access to an abortion – including the need for two doctors’ signatures, and the time limits at which terminations can be carried out – will remain the same and doctors who act outside the law will still face the threat of prosecution. But women who terminate their pregnancy outside the rules, for example after the time limit or by buying pills online, will no longer face arrest or prison. The offence of inducing a miscarriage carries a maximum sentence of life. The amendment, put forward by the Labour backbencher Tonia Antoniazzi, passed in a free vote of MPs, with 379 voting in favour, and 137 voting against. It came after growing calls for a change in the law as the number of women investigated, arrested or prosecuted has increased in recent years. In 2022, a judge at Oxford crown court said he was “flabbergasted” that a prosecution had been brought against a then 25-year-old mother, who had been reported to police when a clinician found pills in her body believed to be abortion medication – even though her 4lb 4oz baby had survived. The recorder, John Hardy KC, described the case as “sad and tragic” and the intended trial as a “waste of court time [that] exacerbates the absence of any public interest I can detect in pursuing this prosecution”. In June 2023, Carla Foster was sentenced to 28 months in prison for terminating a pregnancy between 32 and 34 weeks. She had obtained pills supplied in good faith, after a remote consultation during lockdown. A month later, her sentence was reduced to 14 months and suspended. Sitting at the court of appeal, Dame Victoria Sharp said Foster’s was “a case that calls for compassion, not punishment”. In 2024, the CPS dropped its case against Bethany Cox, then 22, from Teesside. Her barrister, Nicholas Lumley KC, said at the time that she had been interviewed by police in the “throes of grief” and had been investigated for three years. Prosecutors offered no evidence against Cox, who was not in court when she was formally acquitted, because, Lumley said, “she has suffered so extensively over this prosecution and investigation, all the while grieving what took place”. Most recently, just last month, Nicola Packer was cleared of taking abortion pills beyond the time limit after a trial at Isleworth crown court. She had spent almost half a decade waiting for the case to come to court, before she was finally found not guilty. “To waste five years of my life that I’m never going to get back, I don’t know how anybody could justify that – to drag out the trauma continuously,” Packer said. “I would not wish this on anyone,” she added. “It has been the worst four and a half years of my life.” Urging colleagues to vote for her amendment, Antoniazzi highlighted several cases, including Packer’s and a woman called Laura, who had been jailed for two years while her abusive partner, who had coerced her into taking abortion pills, had never faced any consequences. She said parliament had a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to put an end to this” and that there was a “moral imperative here”, which she said was “namely, vulnerable women being dragged from hospital bed to police on suspicion of ending their own pregnancies”. “This is urgent,” she added. “We know multiple women are still in the system, awaiting a decision, accused of breaking this law. They cannot afford to wait.” Among those calling for an urgent change to the law were six medical colleges, the British Medical Association, and charities including Women’s Aid and the Fawcett Society. Prof Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the vote was “a victory for women and for their essential reproductive rights.” “At a time when we’re seeing rollbacks on reproductive rights, most notably in the United States, this crucial milestone in the fight for reproductive rights sends a powerful message that our lawmakers are standing up for women,” Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, said. Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the vote was “a landmark moment for women’s rights in this country and the most significant change to our abortion law since the 1967 Abortion Act was passed”. “This is a hard-won victory,” she added, “and we thank all those who have campaigned alongside us, and in particular those women, like Nicola Packer, who have spoken out about their traumatic experiences in the hope of achieving the change parliament has delivered today.” Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Canada, Keir Starmer indicated that he would have backed the amendment if he had been in parliament, saying that, while it was a free vote, he was a longstanding supporter of safe and legal abortion. “It is a conscience issue, therefore it is a free vote. And therefore in that sense, it’s in the same category as assisted dying,” Starmer said. “But my longstanding in principle position is that women have the right to a safe and legal abortion.” A rival decriminalisation amendment put forward by another Labour backbencher, Stella Creasy, was not put to a vote, while an amendment from Conservative MP Caroline Johnson, which sought to restrict access to telemedicine, did not pass. The changes will not become law until the bill in its entirety passes through the House of Commons and House of Lords, and receives royal assent, but given the size of the government’s majority, it is expected to pass without issue.","2025-06-17T18:17:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/17/decriminalisation-abortion-vote-mps"
"abortion","Texas sues New York official for refusing to take action against abortion provider","Texas has sued a New York official for refusing to take action against an abortion provider, teeing up a state-versus-state battle that is widely expected to end up before the US supreme court. Ken Paxton, Texas’s attorney general, has petitioned the New York state supreme court to order a county clerk to enforce a fine against Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills across state lines. Paxton accused Carpenter last year of mailing abortion pills to a Texas woman in defiance of Texas’s ban on virtually all abortions. After Carpenter failed to show up in a Texas court, a judge ordered her to pay more than $100,000 in penalties. But the acting Ulster county clerk, Taylor Bruck, in New York has twice rejected Paxton’s efforts to levy that fine. Under New York’s “shield law”, state law enforcement officials are blocked from complying with out-of-state prosecutions against abortion providers who ship pills to patients, even if those patients are located outside New York state. “No matter where they reside, pro-abortion extremists who send drugs designed to kill the unborn into Texas will face the full force of our state’s pro-life laws,” Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement announcing Monday’s filing. Bruck, 34, said that he was just following New York state law. “I’m just proud to live in a state that has something like the shield law here to protect our healthcare providers from out-of-state proceedings like this,” Bruck said. “This has the potential of getting appealed up and up and up.” Paxton’s petition marks the latest escalation in the burgeoning clash between states that protect abortion rights and those that do not. In the three years since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion opponents in red states have repeatedly tried to push for legislation and litigation that would curtail people’s ability to cross state lines for abortions or to receive abortion pills in the mail. Meanwhile, blue states, including New York, have enacted an array of shield laws to preserve people’s abortion access. The US supreme court will probably be forced to step in to settle these debates between states, legal experts say. “Ultimately, it’s a states’ rights argument,” Bruck said, adding that he remains “still stunned by the whole thing”. “It’s not something I was really expecting, coming into this role,” Bruck said. “It’s really unprecedented for a clerk to be in this position.”","2025-07-29T16:58:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/29/texas-new-york-lawsuit-abortion-provider"
"abortion","US anti-abortion group expands campaign in UK","A rightwing US group backing an anti-abortion campaigner whose case has become a new source of UK tensions with the Trump administration is significantly expanding activities and spending in Britain. The UK branch of Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which is funding the case of Livia Tossici-Bolt – who is being prosecuted for an alleged breach of a “buffer zone” outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic – increased spending on campaigning and other activities in the UK to more than £1m last year. ADF UK’s income was more than £1.3m in the year up to June last year, according to records filed to Companies House on Friday. It included “ADF support” of £1,119,975. The organisation held discussions with a delegation from the US state department, which visited the UK last month before the release of a statement in which the US voiced concern about “freedom of expression in the UK”. ADF UK, which describes itself as an advocate for “the right of Christians and others to freely associate and share their faith in public”, has been heavily involved in lobbying against the introduction of buffer zones around reproductive health clinics. Its cases have included that of Adam Smith-Connor, who was cited by the US vice-president, JD Vance, as an example of free speech being under threat in Europe, after Smith-Connor was prosecuted for breaching a public space protection order. Tossici-Bolt, ADF UK’s latest high-profile case, was mentioned in the US state department statement on Sunday. A verdict on her alleged breach is expected on Friday. She denies the charges. ADF, which is designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the US, has close links with Donald Trump’s White House and has spoken of working with his administration on areas including the reversal of trans rights. The current speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, is a former ADF lawyer. Filings show that the organisation’s British wing has a staff of nine, one earning a salary of £100,000 a year and two others paid between £90,000 and £100,000. The same records give an overview of ADF UK activities in Britain, which range from briefing MPs to supporting campaigns against the assisted dying bill, and “free speech” cases. The organisation is planning a big event in September in Britain as part of a plan to train law and public policy students. ADF UK has five directors. Two, including the lawyers Robert Clarke and Paul Coleman, are based in the organisation’s international branch headquarters in Austria. UK reproductive healthcare providers have voiced concern about ADF’s role and cited the reversal of abortion rights in the US and pressure exerted by rightwing campaigners. Louise McCudden, the UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, said: “Before safe access zones were implemented last year, the behaviour we saw outside our clinics included spitting, calling women ‘murderers’ and physically blocking people from entering our clinics. “In the US, abortion clinics have been bombed and burned down, and anti-abortion campaigners have been known to gather outside clinics with guns. Doctors have been assassinated.” Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “It is deeply concerning that US anti-abortion extremists are using their significant financial resources to attempt to influence women’s access to safe, legal reproductive healthcare here in the UK. “Following the overturning of Roe v Wade and the re-election of Trump as president, the anti-choice movement in this country have become emboldened in their continued attempt to strip women of their rights, dignity, and future.” An ADF spokesperson said it was a registered human rights charity in the UK and was grateful to the US for bringing attention to what it described as the “free speech crisis” in Britain. “We advance the right to live and speak the truth for all people and are proud to support Livia’s case and the cases of our other clients who have been victims of ‘buffer zone’ censorship,” they said. ADF was named in a Facebook post by the US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office in the US state department, as being among organisations its delegation met while in the UK. It also met officials from the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office and Ofcom, using its talks with Britain’s communications regulator to challenge it on the impact of new online safety laws on freedom of expression. The freedom of expression statement was issued after the delegation met Tossici-Bolt and ADF UK. Among the group was Samuel D Samson, who previously worked for US conservative organisations and was pictured wearing a Make America Great Again cap. He was appointed as a senior adviser at the DRL in January. On the day of Trump’s US election, he tweeted: “Today we choose God over pagan idols.” The DRL’s interest in Britain marks a pivot by an agency set up in the 1970s to advance democracy around the world against the backdrop of the cold war. • This article was amended on 4 April 2025 to remove an incorrect reference that Alliance Defending Freedom had endorsed Donald Trump’s election campaign.","2025-04-02T16:44:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/02/us-anti-abortion-group-expands-campaign-in-uk"
"abortion","Creasy attempt to change abortion law ‘not supported by service providers’","An attempt to change the law on abortion led by the Labour MP Stella Creasy is not supported by “any of the abortion providers in the country”, a leading pro-choice charity has said. Rachael Clarke, the head of advocacy at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas), said Creasy’s NC20 amendment to the criminal justice bill “is not the right way” to overhaul abortion laws. Bpas is instead backing a separate proposal, NC1, put forward by another Labour backbencher, Tonia Antoniazzi. Antoniazzi’s amendment has the support of more than 50 pro-choice organisations. They include Bpas and MSI Reproductive Choices, the two largest abortion providers in England, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “We are not supporting NC20, and neither are any of the abortion providers in the country,” Clarke told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday. She added: “Abortion law is incredibly complex. It governs 250,000 women’s healthcare every single year. “Because of that, it is essential that any huge change to abortion law is properly considered. That means involvement with providers, medical bodies, regulators – and proper debate time in parliament.” She warned that MPs were being asked to back a “generational change” after just three hours of debate next week. Votes on amendments, which must first be selected by the Commons speaker, are due to take place on 17 and 18 June during the report stage of the bill. “For us, unfortunately, although we truly believe that we need overwhelming and generational change for abortion law, Stella Creasy’s amendment is not the right way to do it,” Clarke said. Abortion in England and Wales remains a criminal offence, most often prosecuted under a piece of Victorian legislation, the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. However, the Abortion Act 1967 set out criteria under which abortions could be carried out legally, with most carried out up to 24 weeks, and terminations allowed at any point in certain strict circumstances, such as when the mother’s life is at risk or the child would be born with a severe disability. Antoniazzi’s amendment would remove “women from the criminal law related to abortion”, meaning “no offence is committed by a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy”. The framework by which abortion is accessed would remain the same. “The police cannot be trusted with abortion law – nor can the CPS or the wider criminal justice system,” she said. “My amendment NC1 to the crime and policing bill will give us the urgent change we need to protect women.” Creasy’s amendment seeks to decriminalise abortion up to 24 weeks, negating elements of the Abortion Act. It would also ensure that late-term abortions outside the Abortion Act did not result in prison sentences. “Our proposal explicitly leaves in place the well-established time limit under which you can access an abortion,” Creasy said. “It removes the threat of criminal prosecution for abortion because it is a healthcare matter.” A number of recent criminal prosecutions, including that of Nicola Packer, who was last month found not guilty of carrying out an illegal abortion, have brought the issue to the fore. A petition has gathered more than 103,653 signatures urging the government at Westminster to “remove abortion from criminal law so that no pregnant person can be criminalised for procuring their own abortion”.","2025-06-10T10:54:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/creasy-attempt-to-change-abortion-law-not-supported-by-abortion-providers-bpas"
"abortion","Louisiana investigates New York doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills","Louisiana is investigating a New York doctor over accusations that she mailed abortion pills into the state, Liz Murrill, the state attorney general, said on Monday. The case marks the second investigation into the doctor, Margaret Carpenter, whom Louisiana had indicted earlier this year for allegedly prescribing abortions pills via telehealth to a Louisiana resident. “The young woman was 20 weeks pregnant,” Murrill said. “She and her boyfriend after she gave birth took the baby, wrapped it in a towel and threw it in a garbage can.” Murrill said that police in Shreveport, where the abortion allegedly took place, were investigating the incident alongside her office. A spokesperson for Murrill’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment or documentation of the case. The couple ultimately went to the hospital, according to Murrill. Medical experts widely agree that it is safe to “self-manage” your own abortion using pills in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, these pills can also safely induce an abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. Doctors Without Borders offers guidelines on how to use abortion pills through 22 weeks of pregnancy. Murrill made the comments while speaking at a state legislative hearing about a bill that would allow people to sue an individual or an entity that “performs, causes or substantially facilitates” an abortion. Louisiana already bans virtually all abortions. “This bill provides for civil liability and allows another mechanism – it is another tool in the toolbox for people who are harmed by somebody who is intent on violating our laws,” Murrill said. Carpenter has so far avoided making public statements in the case. An organization that she co-founded, Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we’ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women’s rights,” the organization said in a statement when news of the first Louisiana case against Carpenter broke. “It’s no secret that the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.” Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, has signed an extradition warrant for Carpenter, but she has not been extradited to Louisiana and New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, has vowed to never sign an extradition order for her. New York is one of a handful of blue states that, in the wake of the fall of Roe v Wade, have enacted so-called “shield laws”, which guard abortion providers such as Carpenter against out-of-state prosecutions and civil lawsuits. In spring 2024, such shield laws helped facilitate more than 7,700 monthly abortions in states with total or six-week abortion bans, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. Texas has also sued Carpenter for allegedly mailing abortion pills into the state, in defiance of its abortion bans, but a New York clerk has rejected a Texas request to force Carpenter to pay a fine. Legal analysts expect the issue to wind up in front of the US supreme court.","2025-05-13T20:32:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/louisiana-abortion-pills-ny-doctor-investigation"
"abortion","London mayor reverses TfL ban on ads calling for abortion decriminalisation","The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has stepped in to reverse a ban on adverts on the London transport network calling for abortion to be decriminalised. It is understood that the mayor is seeking an “urgent review” of a Transport for London (TfL) decision to ban the adverts from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) charity on the grounds they may bring the Metropolitan police into disrepute. Bpas had placed the adverts in locations across England and Wales urging people to lobby MPs ahead of an anticipated parliamentary vote on whether to decriminalise abortion. The campaign posters feature the anonymised stories of real women who have been investigated by police and in some cases prosecuted after a termination or pregnancy loss. Bpas was told in correspondence with TfL that it would not run the adverts because “the proposed advertisement makes serious allegations about the police”. The transport body later said in a statement that the material “did not comply with TfL advertising policy because it made negative references about the police”. The decision to ban the ads came despite TfL previously allowing pro-choice campaign material on buses across London, sponsored by Doctors for Choice and Abortion Talk and featuring the slogan “abortion is healthcare, not a crime”. Last year, campaign material on assisted dying from Dignity in Dying was also approved to run on the network, including in Westminster tube station. Bpas had said it planned to appeal against the TfL decision “at the highest levels” and asked for “an immediate in-depth explanation” of the reasoning behind the rejection. A source close to the London mayor said: “As chair of TfL, Sadiq is going to seek an urgent review of this decision. Women’s voices must be heard.” It is understood that the mayor is expecting the transport body to act quickly and there to be acknowledgement of the fact that Bpas’s campaign is aimed at changing the law, not criticising the police. Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of Bpas, said: “This campaign was launched in support of Tonia Antoniazzi MP’s amendment to the crime and policing bill, and we expect a vote in parliament in a matter of weeks. This is a pivotal moment for MPs to reform our abortion law and prevent more women from suffering the trauma and injustice of police investigations and the risk of criminalisation.” The amendment to the government’s crime and policing bill would remove women from the criminal law related to abortion in England and Wales. It is backed by charities, trade unions and medical colleges, including Bpas and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. A separate amendment, put forward by the fellow Labour MP Stella Creasy, seeks to decriminalise abortion as well as write into law a human right to access abortion. Earlier, Antoniazzi said she was “stunned” by TfL’s decision to refuse to run the adverts on its network. “The police cannot be trusted with abortion law – nor can the CPS or the wider criminal justice system,” she said. “My amendment NC1 to the crime and policing bill will give us the urgent change we need to protect women.” She later said on X that she planned to write to Khan about the “unacceptable” decision and on Sunday said she was “really pleased” that the London mayor had stepped in. Stewart said: “Ahead of the vote in parliament, it is absolutely vital that the voices of the women who have been so deeply harmed by the current law are allowed to be heard. We urge the mayor to take swift action and allow our charity to share these stories as a matter of urgency.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2025 to remove text stating that the Bpas adverts had been “approved by the Advertising Standards Authority”. The ASA does not approve adverts.","2025-06-02T06:00:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/02/london-mayor-reverses-tfl-ban-on-ads-abortion-decriminalisation"
"abortion","Paramedic jailed for 10 years for secretly giving woman abortion drug during sex","A paramedic who tricked a woman into having an abortion by secretly inserting drugs inside her during sex has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Stephen Doohan, 33, was married when he met the woman on holiday in Spain in 2021 and began a long-distance relationship. In March 2023, the woman travelled to Edinburgh to see him after learning she was pregnant, the high court in Glasgow heard. On 17 March, Doohan inserted an abortion drug in her vagina without her knowledge during consensual sex and the following day insisted on seeing her underwear after she noticed white discharge, the court heard. Last month he had pleaded guilty to sexual assault and depositing a drug into her vagina causing her to abort, and depositing with intent to cause her to abort. On Monday the defendant, a clinical team leader at the Scottish ambulance service, was sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison. The court heard that the paramedic convinced the woman, who has not been named, to lie to doctors at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary because he thought he would be arrested if she told the truth. The victim attended another regional hospital with her sister and was told that she was having a miscarriage. The court heard that in May 2023 the woman complained to the Scottish ambulance service, which launched an investigation. On 14 March, the day the woman told Doohan she was pregnant, he used a work intranet to search for abortion drugs, the court was told. Sentencing, Lord Colbeck said: “You put her through considerable pain over a number of days, and left her facing a lifetime of pain and loss.” He also said Doohan caused “long-term psychological injury” to his victim. The court heard that the crimes occurred over 48 hours, starting on 17 March at Doohan’s flat in Edinburgh. Colbeck said Doohan had told the woman he did not want children, but she later became pregnant. The judge said: “She felt something hard being inserted into her vagina and believed this was a sex toy.” However, the following day, after discovering unusual discharge in her underwear, and suffering stomach cramps, she returned to Doohan’s flat. The judge said: “She took some diazepam and went into a deep sleep, and felt you initiating sexual contact. “She felt you inserting something hard from under the mattress. She was suspicious of your actions. “When you went to the bathroom, she took the opportunity to look under the mattress.” The woman found some tablets hidden under the mattress, the court heard. Colbeck said: “The complainer then carried out an internet search for abortion tablets and confronted you over your actions.” He added: “You planned out what you did to your victim using resources available to you as a paramedic.” Defending, Mark Stewart KC said: “I express Mr Doohan’s deep sorrow and regret for the actions he is now in the court charged with. “His position is that he is filled with remorse for the harm he has caused, and the breach of trust his actions represented.”","2025-07-07T17:16:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/07/paramedic-jailed-for-10-years-for-secretly-giving-woman-abortion-drug-during-sex"
"abortion","Calls for abortion law change grew louder as number of prosecutions rose","Calls for decriminalisation of abortions have been growing louder in recent years – in line with a growing number of women being prosecuted for terminating their pregnancies. Until 2022, it is believed that only three women had ever been convicted of having an illegal abortion in the 150 years since 1861, when the procedure was made illegal under the Offences Against the Person Act. But in the last four years, at least half a dozen women have found themselves in the dock of a crown court accused of ending their pregnancy, and dozens more have been arrested or investigated by police. Two high-profile cases in particular fuelled the calls for change. Carla Foster was jailed in 2023 for an illegal abortion, before having her sentence suspended a month later by the court of appeal. And just weeks ago, Nicola Packer was cleared by a jury after spending almost five years facing the threat of prison. Thirteen people, both men and women, made a first appearance at magistrates court charged with abortion-related offences in 2022, according to freedom of information data from the Crown Prosecution Service, compared with four people in 2019 and three in both 2020 and 2021. Data from about half of Britain’s police forces showed at least 11 people were arrested in 2023 on suspicion of child destruction or inducing a miscarriage, including a 31-year-old woman in north Wales “reported to have taken illicit substances to initiate an abortion”. There are several more known cases of women arrested in the past 18 months that are not included in the data. In the last parliament, Diana Johnson, now a Home Office minister, attempted to change the law by bringing an amendment to the previous government’s criminal justice bill, but the 2024 general election meant the legislation never made its way through parliament. Parliament had already brought in a move towards more liberal abortion laws. In 2020 telemedicine brought the biggest reform to abortion provision in England and Wales since the 1967 Abortion Act, which set out the current framework by which terminations can be carried out. Instead of women seeking a termination in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy needing to take the first pill under medical supervision, they could receive both pills by post after a remote consultation. Although it was introduced as an emergency measure during the pandemic, telemedicine was made permanent in 2022, with MPs voting 215 in favour to 188 against. The same year, parliament also voted 297-110 to introduce safe access zones, commonly known as “buffer zones” around clinics, to stop women seeking abortion care from being harassed by protesters. In 2019, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws were also modernised, with terminations allowed up to 12 weeks, and later under limited circumstances. In a referendum in 2018, Ireland had also made abortion legal on request up to 12 weeks, and later if the foetus would be likely to die before or shortly after birth or if there is a risk of death or serious harm to a pregnant woman. In both Northern Ireland and Ireland, the culpability for a termination carried out outside legal time frames lies with anyone who assists a woman procure an abortion, rather than the woman herself. Both countries had also previously had some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, with terminations banned in almost all circumstances. In other parts of the world, change is moving in the opposite direction. In June 2022, the United States supreme court overturned the decision of Roe v Wade, and ruled there was no constitutional right to abortion. Laws are instead now decided state by state, with 19 of them either banning abortion or restricting access. Parliament’s latest vote is unlikely be the last on the subject. Medics, lawyers, politicians and campaigners recognise that the 1967 act is in need of reform. Work to establish what a new framework should look like has already begun, but as Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, a reproductive health NGO, said: “Getting abortion law reform right will take time, and we want to make sure we do that in a way that takes into account expert opinion, takes into account women’s voices [and] human rights groups.” But, McCudden said: “The women who are being investigated and facing prosecution and jail can’t afford to wait.” And parliament’s latest vote means that now there will be no more Carla Fosters, or Nicola Packers.","2025-06-17T18:19:22Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/17/abortion-vote-decriminalisation-prosecutions-rising"
"abortion","Arizona court permanently blocks 15-week abortion ban","A court permanently blocked Arizona’s 15-week abortion ban from taking effect on Wednesday, months after Arizona residents voted to pass a ballot measure adding abortion rights into the state constitution. “For two years, I’ve seen firsthand how our state’s abortion ban has harmed my patients, with countless lives and futures changed because politicians thought their views of the right healthcare was more important than pregnant people and their medical providers,” Dr Eric M Reuss, one of the healthcare providers who brought the lawsuit over Arizona’s 15-week ban, said in a statement. The 15-week ban had already been paused since December, when Reuss and other providers filed their lawsuit, which argued that the ballot measure, which adds constitutional protections for abortion until about 24 weeks, meant the ban was now unconstitutional. Arizona’s attorney general, Democrat Kris Mayes, had agreed not to enforce the ban while litigation played out. The short ruling on Wednesday, from Judge Frank Moskowitz of Maricopa county superior court, agreed that the 15-week ban was unconstitutional and forbade Arizona officials from enforcing it. Arizona spent much of 2024 at the center of the contentious US abortion wars, after a state supreme court agreed to let a near-total abortion ban take effect. The threat of that ban – which dated back to 1864, before Arizona had become a state – unleashed nationwide outrage. State legislators, including Republicans, quickly scrambled to repeal the 1864 ban and let the 15-week ban, which was already on the books, stand in its place. Arizona then became one of seven states to pass pro-abortion rights ballot measures in the 2024 elections. However, these measures did not immediately restore or strengthen access to abortion – rather, activists have had to push for litigation or legislation to make good on the ballots’ promises. After a lengthy court battle, Missouri, which banned virtually all abortions before its residents voted in favor of a pro-abortion rights measure, has also now restored access to the procedure. In a statement on Wednesday, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, vowed to continue trying to topple other barriers to abortion access in Arizona. “Burdensome and pointless requirements leveled at abortion providers and mandatory waiting periods for patients continue to undermine the voters’ will,” Northup said. “We will keep fighting to ensure that Arizonans get all the freedoms they voted for and rightfully expect.”","2025-03-05T16:56:22Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/05/arizona-court-ruling-15-week-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Trump launches fresh attacks on US abortion rights","The Trump administration fired off a series of dramatic attacks on abortion rights on Tuesday, as it signaled its plan to drop out of a case defending access to emergency abortions while asking the US supreme court for permission to join a case against the abortion provider Planned Parenthood. The justice department said it would move to dismiss the case over emergency abortions, which had been originally filed by the Biden administration, according to court papers filed by the largest hospital network in Idaho. The Biden administration had sued Idaho over its near-total abortion ban, which it accused of running afoul of a federal law that protects patients’ right to health care in emergencies. The dismissal could come as soon as Wednesday, St Luke’s Health System wrote in a court filing. The hospital has previously said that Idaho’s ban forced its providers to fly women out of state for emergency care. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has filed paperwork asking the US supreme court to let it join the upcoming oral arguments in a case over South Carolina’s attempt to eradicate Medicaid funding for medical services offered by Planned Parenthood. Although it is already illegal to use federal dollars to pay for abortions, South Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, ordered the state department of health to block Planned Parenthood from Medicaid because, McMaster said: “payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life”. The Trump administration hopes to help defend South Carolina’s actions, asking for 10 minutes of the April oral arguments’ running time. South Carolina is being represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a powerhouse Christian legal group that was the architect of much of the conservative attack on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Under Medicaid rules, patients may choose to see any provider who is qualified to treat them. Planned Parenthood typically provides an array of reproductive and sexual health services, such as STI testing and birth control. South Carolina also bans abortions past six weeks of pregnancy – before many women even realize they are pregnant. These moves appear to mark some of the administration’s first major actions on abortion. In his first term, Donald Trump appointed many of the supreme court justices who voted to overturn the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. “The Trump administration has made clear they would let women die rather than get an abortion,” Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer at the ACLU, said in a statement after news of the Idaho filing broke. “On the campaign trail, President Trump repeatedly promised not to interfere with women’s ability to access abortion and patients’ ability to get the care they need. His failure to keep that promise, six weeks into his administration, goes against the will of the vast majority of people in this country who want and expect their loved ones to be able to get the care they need at a hospital.” The Tuesday filing from St Luke’s came as the hospital seeks a court order allowing doctors to continue providing abortions in emergency situations as they deem necessary. Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from US emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v Wade amid questions about what care they could legally provide, federal records showed. The supreme court stepped into the Idaho case last year and ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to continue performing emergency abortions as doctors deemed necessary. The high court did not, however, resolve key legal questions in the case, and it was argued before the ninth US circuit court of appeals in December. The appeals court has not yet ruled, but Idaho has argued that its state law allows for abortions in life-threatening situations and that the Biden administration was trying to improperly expand its exceptions. A justice department spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Idaho officials also did not immediately reply to requests for comment. “This case is about preserving South Carolina’s authority to govern itself in a way that aligns with the law and our state’s values,” Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for McMaster, said in a statement. “Governor McMaster thanks the Trump administration for defending our ability to protect life.” “Governor McMaster welcomes and appreciates the Trump administration’s support in Medina v Planned Parenthood. This case is about preserving South Carolina’s authority to govern itself in a way that aligns with the law and our state’s values. Governor McMaster thanks the Trump administration for defending our ability to protect life.” About 50,000 people in the US develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive. Before the court blocked the state from enforcing the ban in health-threatening emergencies, some Idaho doctors reported that pregnant women were facing delays in care and in some cases being flown to out-of-state hospitals for treatment they would have previously been able to get at home. Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy.","2025-03-05T00:43:57Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/trump-attacks-abortion-rights-idaho-south-carolina"
"abortion","More than 50 cross-party MPs back amendment to decriminalise abortion","An amendment proposing to decriminalise abortion has been tabled in parliament, backed by a group of more than 50 cross-party MPs. Put forward by the MP Tonia Antoniazzi, it is supported by several of her Labour colleagues including Nadia Whittome, Jess Asato and Antonia Bance. It has the backing of Liberal Democrats including Christine Jardine, Wera Hobhouse and Daisy Cooper, as well as the Green party’s Siân Berry and Carla Denyer, Sorcha Eastwood from the Alliance party, and Liz Saville-Roberts and Llinos Medi from Plaid Cymru. Conservative MP Caroline Dineage also added her name to the amendment, as well as Claire Hanna from the SDLP. Antoniazzi’s amendment seeks to remove “women from the criminal law related to abortion”, and would mean “no offence is committed by a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy”. It would mean women would no longer be criminalised under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, the piece of Victorian legislation that most recent abortion cases have been prosecuted under. Nor would they be criminalised under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, which carries the offence of “child destruction”. The amendment, to the government’s crime and policing bill, follows on from one the Labour MP Diana Johnson, now a Home Office minister, had attempted to put forward to the last Conservative government’s criminal justice bill, but which was never voted on as the legislation fell because a general election was called. Antoniazzi said she had put forward the amendment because a change in the law “is necessary”. “We’ve seen a sharp rise in the number of women and girls facing criminal investigations following pregnancy loss and abortion,” she said. “It’s just wrong to put women in this situation, to put them into the criminal justice system, because this is not a criminal law issue, this is essentially a healthcare matter.” She added: “I find it unbelievable that in the last five years, around 100 women have been investigated by the police. It’s just wrong. It’s a waste of taxpayers’ money, it’s a waste of the judiciary’s time, and it’s not in the public interest. Therefore, the law has to change.” The most recent woman to be prosecuted, Nicola Packer, 45, spent almost five years waiting for her case to come to court, before being unanimously cleared by a jury at Isleworth crown court last week. Antoniazzi attended court for a day of the trial with her colleague Tracy Gilbert MP to support Packer. “I think it is, it is utterly, utterly disgraceful that she was put in this position, and shame on those people that brought this case forward,” Antoniazzi said. The amendment, which if passed could become law as early as this summer, mirrors Johnson’s previous amendment, Antoniazzi said, and “doesn’t change anything about the provision of abortion services”. Rather than seeking to create a new framework, it retains the existing abortion law, she said: “There’s no change to time limits, and also how women access care, the need for two doctor signatures.” A change to the law is being supported by professional bodies including the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing, and the Royal College of General Practitioners. “This is a simple amendment that looks after women, which is our principal aim here, to make sure that they are not criminalised for something that is not in the public interest,” Antoniazzi said. “It’s in their interest that we make sure that these women get the right support, the right help, and are not reported to the police for a pregnancy loss, a miscarriage, or a situation that they find themselves in that has become impossible,” she added. “These women are vulnerable. They need our help, and they don’t deserve to have their lives ruined.”","2025-05-14T06:25:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/cross-party-mps-back-amendment-decriminalise-abortion"
"abortion","New York county clerk rejects Texas’s effort to fine doctor in abortion pill case","A New York county clerk again rejected an effort by Texas to fine a New York-based doctor accused of shipping abortion pills across state lines, in a case that could tee up a US supreme court showdown between states that protect abortion access and those that ban it. On Monday, the acting Ulster county clerk, Taylor Bruck, rejected a court filing by Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, which sought to collect a $113,000 penalty against Dr Margaret Carpenter. Paxton had sued Carpenter in December 2024 over allegations she shipped abortion pills to a Texas woman in defiance of the state’s ban on virtually all abortions. When Carpenter did not show up to a court hearing earlier this year, a judge automatically ruled against her and ordered her to pay the fine as well as stop mailing pills to Texas. However, New York is one of a handful of blue states that has enacted a “shield law”, which blocks state officials from extraditing abortion providers to other states or complying with out-of-state court orders. In his initial refusal to levy the fine, issued in March, Bruck cited the shield law. “The rejection stands. Resubmitting the same materials does not alter the outcome,” Bruck said in his response to Paxton on Monday. “While I’m not entirely sure how things work in Texas, here in New York, a rejection means the matter is closed.” As a signoff, Bruck added New York state’s motto: “Excelsior.” The word means “ever upward” in Latin. Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After the first rejection, Paxton said in a statement that he was “outraged”. “New York is shredding the constitution to hide lawbreakers from justice, and it must end,” he continued. “I will not stop my efforts to enforce Texas’s pro-life laws that protect our unborn children and mothers.” Shield laws like New York’s, which sprang up in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, have never been tested in court. However, anti-abortion activists are trying to change that, as they have grown increasingly frustrated by the accessibility of abortion through out-of-state travel and the availability of abortions pills through telehealth. Despite the wave of state-level abortion bans unleashed by the fall of Roe, the number of abortions performed in the US is still on the rise, in large part thanks to providers’ ability to facilitate the procedure through shield laws. In December 2024, shield law providers facilitated almost 14,000 abortions in states that ban almost all abortions or that restrict telehealth abortions, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. Experts widely expect that the Texas case, or another similar case involving shield laws, will ultimately be decided by the supreme court.","2025-07-15T18:47:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/15/new-york-doctor-abortion-pill-lawsuit-texas"
"abortion","Letitia James will ‘step in to defend’ New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to Texas","Letitia James, New York’s Democratic attorney general, has formally announced her intention to intervene in a Texas attempt to penalize a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills across state lines, escalating one of the most consequential fights in the US abortion wars. The move on Monday tees up a showdown between states that ban abortion and those that protect it – one that, legal experts say, challenges fundamental constitutional issues and will probably end up in front of the US supreme court. The Republican Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, first sued the doctor, Margaret Carpenter, late last year, accusing her of violating Texas’s near-total abortion ban by shipping pills to a Texas woman. After Carpenter failed to turn up for a court appearance, a Texas judge ordered her to pay more than $100,000 in fines. However, an acting New York clerk in Ulster county refused to enforce the fine against Carpenter, as New York has a “shield law” that forbids state officials from extraditing abortion providers to other states or complying with out-of-state court orders such as the one issued in Texas. Paxton then sued that clerk, Taylor Bruck. On Monday, James formally notified an Ulster county supreme court judge that she will intervene in Paxton’s lawsuit. She is set to file briefs in court later this month that will argue that Texas cannot use New York courts to enforce its abortion laws. “I am stepping in to defend the integrity of our laws and our courts against this blatant overreach,” James said in a statement. “Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here.” Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The outcome of the landmark case between Texas and New York will reverberate across the country, as abortion pills and shield laws have become increasingly vital to US abortion provision in the three years since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. By the end of 2024, providers who live in the handful of blue states with shield laws were mailing more than 10,000 abortion pills a month to people who live in states that ban virtually all abortions or prohibit abortion via telemedicine, according to data from the research project #WeCount. Incensed by this development, anti-abortion activists have launched numerous legal and legislative broadsides against abortion pills. Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent anti-abortion lawyer in Texas, has represented multiple plaintiffs suing abortion providers for allegedly facilitating abortions. Last week, the Texas state legislature passed a law that lets people sue abortion pill providers who are suspected of mailing the pills to Texas. The following day, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, suggested that the US government would curb access to a key abortion pill. Many of these efforts raise fundamental questions about the relationship between US states and their obligations to respect each other’s laws. The closest parallel to the fight over shield laws, experts have noted, are the pre-civil war battles between states over how to treat enslaved people who had escaped slaveholding states and fled into states that banned the practice.","2025-09-08T14:57:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/letitia-james-new-york-doctor-abortion-texas"
"abortion","TfL blocks ads calling on people to lobby MPs to decriminalise abortion","Transport for London has blocked adverts that urge people to lobby their MPs to vote to decriminalise abortion from running on its network because it claims they could bring the police and City Hall into disrepute. Parliament is expected to vote on whether to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales in the coming weeks, with amendments tabled to the crime and policing bill seeking to change the law. The adverts from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) charity have appeared on display boards across England and Wales. They feature anonymised case studies of women who have been investigated by police, and in some cases prosecuted, after terminations or pregnancy loss. “The language is not inflammatory, derogatory or hateful,” Bpas said in a letter to TfL, seen by the Guardian. “It is an accurate representation of real women’s experiences. It is intentionally simple, to the point, with a clear democratic call to action.” In 2024, campaign material from Dignity in Dying was displayed on the TfL network, including in Westminster tube station. In the same year, it allowed pro-choice campaign material on buses across London, sponsored by Doctors for Choice and Abortion Talk, which featured the slogan “abortion is healthcare, not a crime”. At the time, a TfL spokesperson said: “We reviewed this advertising campaign against both our advertising policy and the Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) code, and it was found to be compliant.” Bpas said it had requested “an immediate in-depth explanation of the decision to reject our material” from the transport body. In a response from TfL, also seen by the Guardian, Chris Reader, the organisation’s head of commercial media, told the charity: “The reason for the rejection is that the proposed advertisement makes serious allegations about the police. “The Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Mopac) is a member of the GLA group and one of its functions is to hold the Metropolitan police service (MPS) commissioner to account for the police service in London.” He added that “because Mopac’s functions in respect of the MPS are to some extent regulatory”, the “nature of the copy could bring Mopac into disrepute, given its responsibilities in relation to the MPS”. Bpas’s chief executive, Heidi Stewart, said the charity intended to appeal against the decision by the transport body. “At a pivotal moment for abortion law reform in this country, TfL regulations have silenced the voices of women who have been left utterly traumatised by our archaic legislation and by those enforcing it,” Stewart said. “This cannot be allowed to happen again. Women deserve to have their stories told – and the public has a right to hear them. We will be challenging this decision at the highest levels.” Tonia Antoniazzi, one of the Labour MPs putting forward an amendment aiming to change the law, said she was “stunned” by the decision to ban the adverts from the network, adding it was an attempt to “silence desperate women’s voices and dodge accountability”. She added: “In the last month, we’ve heard how police forced through the prosecution of a woman for abortion offences, have issued guidance telling police to search the homes of women who’ve had stillbirths, and that decisions about enforcement on abortion are made at the highest levels of the Met. “It’s not hard to see why they wouldn’t want the public to know. It’s not these women’s stories that bring the police into disrepute – it’s their own actions.” Antoniazzi’s amendment, which would remove women from the criminal law related to abortion in England and Wales, is backed by charities, trade unions, and medical colleges, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as well as Bpas. “The police cannot be trusted with abortion law – nor can the CPS or the wider criminal justice system,” she said. “My amendment NC1 to the crime and policing bill will give us the urgent change we need to protect women.” A separate amendment, put forward by another Labour backbencher, Stella Creasy, seeks to decriminalise abortion, as well as write into law a human right to access abortion. A TfL spokesperson said: “The proposed advertisement did not comply with TfL advertising policy because it made negative references about the police.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2025 to remove text stating that the Bpas adverts “have been approved by the Advertising Standards Authority”. The ASA does not approve adverts.","2025-05-31T05:00:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/31/transport-for-london-tfl-blocks-ads-bpas-decriminalise-abortion"
"abortion","UK woman who took pills during lockdown cleared of illegal abortion","A woman has been cleared of illegally terminating a pregnancy, after taking abortion pills during lockdown. Nicola Packer took the pills at home in November 2020. She had been prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol after a remote consultation. She later delivered a foetus, which the court heard was estimated to be about 26 weeks in gestation, which she brought with her to Chelsea and Westminster hospital, Isleworth crown court heard. She was arrested in hospital and later charged with “unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing” with the “intent to procure a miscarriage”. Packer had been prescribed the medication under emergency pandemic legislation – later made permanent – that allows for pills to be dispatched by post after a remote consultation in pregnancies up to 10 weeks. The prosecution had alleged that she believed she was more than 10 weeks pregnant at the time she took the pills. But she denied the charges, and was found not guilty by a jury of nine women and three men, who returned a unanimous verdict, after the two-week trial. “The facts of this case are a tragedy but they are not a crime and Ms Packer is not guilty of this offence,” Fiona Horlick KC, defending Packer, said in her closing speech on Tuesday. “It is hard to imagine how traumatically awful it must have been for Ms Packer thinking that she would only see blood clots to look into the toilet bowl and see a small but fully formed baby,” she told the jury. “Four and a half years later you can see how she is still utterly traumatised by that.” Remote prescribing legislation introduced during the pandemic allowed pills to be dispatched by post for pregnancies up to 10 weeks. The normal time limit for abortions in England and Wales is 23 weeks and six days, with no time limits in place if certain criteria are in place, such as a severe foetal anomaly or a risk to the mother’s life. The prosecution had alleged that Packer had known she was more than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the pills that she received in the post. Packer, 45, who was supported by five people in the public gallery, cried and wiped her eyes as the verdict was delivered by the foreperson of the jury, which had been deliberating since Wednesday morning. She had been allowed to sit at the back of the court, behind her defence team, rather than in the dock, for most of the trial. Addressing the court, Judge Edmunds KC said that “one can only hope that if there are cases relating to other events that happened during that very difficult period of Covid” that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would “balance whether it is in the public interest for those matters to be prosecuted”. At a previous hearing, before the case went to trial, the judge had asked the CPS to carry out a review into whether continuing with the case was in the public interest. A CPS spokesperson said: “Following a request from the judge to review the case in view of the length of time which passed since the alleged offending, we acted to carry out a full further review of the case before the decision was taken to continue the prosecution. The judge was informed of our decision.” The case, which loomed over Packer for almost half a decade and resulted in the most personal details of her life, including medical history, sexual preferences and even intimate photographs, shared in court, has led to renewed calls for abortion to be removed from the criminal statute books. Katie Saxon, the chief strategic communications officer at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “A woman who sought medical attention after experiencing a traumatic event has had to endure a protracted police investigation and public trial, her private life picked apart by prosecutors and reported in the national press, at a huge emotional and financial cost. “Prosecuting women for ‘illegal’ abortion is never in the public interest, and no woman should ever have to go through this again.” Dr Ranee Thakar, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “As a doctor, I am acutely aware of how vital it is that women can access essential healthcare in a safe and supportive environment. “Restrictive abortion laws in England and Wales nurture an environment of fear, stigmatisation and criminalisation. They needlessly subject women to prolonged investigation, criminal charges, and custodial sentences for ending their own pregnancy.” She said Packer’s case “shows just how outdated and harmful these laws have become”, adding: “Abortion reform is urgently needed and now is the time for change.”","2025-05-08T15:37:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/08/uk-woman-who-took-pills-during-lockdown-cleared-of-abortion"
"abortion","Argentina used as a ‘testing ground’ for eroding abortion rights, warns Amnesty","Argentina is being used as a “testing ground” for stripping back abortion rights internationally as it cuts funding for contraceptives and ends the distribution of abortion pills, Amnesty International warned on Wednesday. Before the inauguration of President Javier Milei in December 2023, the state bought abortion pills, which were then distributed for free through the public health system. In 2023, the state supplied more than 166,000 doses of misoprostol and a joint mifepristone-misoprostol therapy known as a combipack, according to data collected by Amnesty. But it delivered none last year, with responsibility quietly handed over to the country’s 23 provinces. Amnesty said the switch was “hindering access to abortion services for women”, and that more than half of the provinces reported a shortage of misoprostol, and almost all reported shortages of mifepristone and combipack. According to the Argentine Network for Access to Safe Abortion, the change is having the biggest impact in provinces where politicians are anti-abortion or have fewer economic resources. Project Mirar, an initiative that monitors implementation of the abortion law, said provinces had struggled to negotiate prices as effectively as the state, and that some did not have the budget to buy the drugs. One report found that in some cases women had been forced to buy the medication themselves, which it said could cost about $160 (£120). Amnesty has warned that reproductive health policies being pushed by Argentina’s far-right government are linked to Project 25, the ultra-conservative policy blueprint being championed by the Trump administration in the US. Mariela Belski, director of Amnesty International Argentina, said she believed that “Argentina has been used as a testing ground for several of the policies featured in the Heritage Foundation’s 2025 plan”, including restricting access to abortion and limiting broader sexual and reproductive rights. “It is part of a global backlash that seeks to dismantle hard-won gains secured by women. It is also happening under Donald Trump’s leadership in the United States and in countries such as Hungary,” said Belski. Argentina legalised abortion in all cases up to 14 weeks of pregnancy in 2020, after sweeping protests known as the “green wave” movement. Previously, the procedure was permitted only in cases of rape or if the woman’s health was at risk. The legalisation heralded a success for women’s rights in Argentina and regionally. Between 2021 and 2023, 283,000 voluntary and legal abortions were provided by Argentina’s public sector, while abortion-related deaths more than halved between 2020 and 2022. But Milei has dismantled dozens of public policies relating to women’s rights since taking power. He has closed the ministry of women, genders and diversity, slashed programmes aimed at combating gender violence, and drastically cut funding for contraceptives. The Argentinian leader told an audience of high-school pupils that abortion should be considered “aggravated murder”, and declared to the World Economic Forum that feminists were “promoters of the bloody, murderous abortion agenda”. On the campaign trail, Milei said pro-choice Argentines were “brainwashed by a homicidal policy” and vowed to launch a referendum to overturn the abortion law. In February 2024, a small group of legislators from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party went further still, filing a bill in congress to repeal the landmark 2020 abortion law. The bill was quickly withdrawn, but in December a high-ranking member of the government said that a push to repeal or change the law could go ahead this year. In Tucumán, a conservative province in north-west Argentina, healthcare providers say they are witnessing a rise in unsafe abortions amid supply delays and misinformation. Adriana Alvarez, a gynaecologist who provides abortions at a public hospital in Tucumán, said supplies had repeatedly been disrupted over the past year. “We’re now seeing, as we saw many years ago, unsafe abortions. They are being driven underground,” she said. “We’ve gone backwards.” Amnesty said it had received 120 complaints from women requesting help and reporting being obstructed in trying to access abortions last year, up from 32 in 2023. Between January and April this year, Amnesty said it had received reports of 160 such cases. Alvarez said women were arriving at the clinic with “fear in their eyes”. “They say they don’t want their family to find out, or to go to certain hospitals because people work there that they know,” she said. “We have women who come and ask if they are still allowed to have an abortion,” she said. “They’re scared of going to jail.” Those most affected are the poorest and most vulnerable women in society, with some susceptible to misinformation on social media, healthcare professionals warned. Soledad Deza, a lawyer and president of Fundación Mujeres x Mujeres, which helps women access abortions, said the shift in official policy had confused women about the legality of abortion. “There has been so much discourse around thinking of abortion as homicide that women do not know if they are exercising a right or committing a crime,” she said. Milei’s anti-abortion rhetoric has also prompted growing numbers of doctors in Argentina to refuse to carry out terminations, according to medical professionals across the country. Julieta Bazán, a doctor in Buenos Aires, said professionals – whether ultrasound staff, nurses or doctors – “no longer want to guarantee” abortion rights due to discrimination and a lack of resources. The “noticeable” abortion pill shortage was a “violation of our law”, she said.","2025-05-28T10:00:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/28/argentina-womens-rights-javier-milei-testing-ground-eroding-abortion-rights-seek-reverse-landmark-legalisation-warning-amnesty"
"abortion","The Trump administration is defending abortion pill access in court. What?","The Trump administration on Monday asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit that takes aim at the abortion pill mifepristone – a move that stunned many observers for what seemed a defense of the drug by a president who has overseen the most dramatic rollback of abortion rights in modern US history. At first blush, it may seem a victory for abortion access – but experts worry that, in reality, the move preserves the administration’s ability to play coy about any future plans to attack abortion rights. When Donald Trump first returned to the White House earlier this year, US anti-abortion activists had high hopes for the man who helped orchestrate the downfall of Roe v Wade. They thought he might use a 19th-century anti-vice law to in effect ban abortion nationwide. Failing that, they imagined that he might use the power of the Food and Drug Administration to roll back access to mifepristone or even yank it from the market entirely. Instead, over the last few months, the Trump administration has attempted to dodge the issue entirely. The Monday request, to a Texas judge who has become a reliable vote for abortion opponents, continued that pattern. The lawsuit seeks to roll back several FDA regulatory changes that have, over the last decade, considerably expanded access to mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in US medication abortions. It revives a lawsuit that led to a stinging 9-0 defeat for abortion rights opponents when the court ruled the lawsuit’s plaintiffs, a group of anti-abortion doctors, did not have the legal standing to sue in the first place. Rather than let the matter die, the Republican attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri moved to take over the case as its new plaintiffs. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the US district court for the northern district of Texas, where the case is being heard, agreed to let the attorneys general move forward. However, in its Monday filing, the Trump administration argued that there was no reason why the case should proceed in Texas. “At bottom, the states cannot keep alive a lawsuit in which the original plaintiffs were held to lack standing, those plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims, and the states’ own claims have no connection to this district,” the administration wrote. Abortion rights supporters have long pointed to one reason why the case was filed in Texas: Kacsmaryk. A Trump appointee with a track record of abortion opposition, Kacsmaryk once took the unprecedented step of ruling to reverse the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone, which would lead to its removal from the market. Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health, found it “a little funny” that the Trump administration’s filing seemed to call out its own side for judge-shopping. It is possible that Trump, who was never exactly a true believer in the anti-abortion movement, has now soured on it. While the movement helped propel him to the White House in 2016, it became something of an albatross for him in 2024, as outrage over Roe’s collapse led abortion rights to become one of the election’s top issues. Yet Huberfeld found the filing more notable for what it did not say: namely, it shied away from revealing the Trump administration’s plans for mifepristone. She believes the administration may try to change mifepristone access through the FDA, and that the legal reasoning in Monday’s filing could be used against a future lawsuit by blue states against new restrictions. “They’re basically saying that the states don’t get to just challenge FDA policy because they want to,” Huberfeld said. “Which, in my view, is a set-up for anticipating that blue states may try to challenge any changes on mifepristone rules.” The FDA commissioner, Martin Makary, could, for example, move to reverse regulations that permit people to dispense abortion pills through telehealth – which accounts for about a fifth of all US abortions – or eliminate mifepristone’s approval. Project 2025, the notorious playbook of policy proposals authored by the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, urged the FDA to do exactly that. Last month, Makary told the Semafor World Economy Summit that he had “no plans to take action” on mifepristone. However, he added: “There is an ongoing set of data that is coming into the FDA on mifepristone. So if the data suggests something or tells us that there’s a real signal, we can’t promise we’re not going to act on that data.” Decades of studies, conducted in more than a dozen countries, have found that mifepristone is safe and effective. However, anti-abortion groups have repeatedly pushed studies that claimed to find that mifepristone is dangerous. (Some of those studies have been retracted.) “My guess is that the Trump administration is trying to walk the fine line of not looking like it’s threatening access to mifepristone while also, potentially, through the FDA trying to limit access to mifepristone,” Huberfeld said. “In other words, I don’t think the FDA’s actually going to be hands-off.”","2025-05-06T20:00:12Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/06/abortion-pill-trump-administration"
"abortion","Trump’s aid cuts in east Africa led to unwanted abortion and babies being born with HIV – report","Aid cuts in east Africa have led to cases of babies being born with HIV because mothers could not get medication, a rise in life-threatening infections, and at least one woman having an unwanted abortion, according to interviews with medical staff, patients and experts. A report by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) sets out dozens of examples of the impact of disruption to Pepfar – the president’s emergency plan for aids relief – in Tanzania and Uganda. Pepfar, a leading US global health programme, launched in 2003 and is credited with saving millions of lives, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The report is based on interviews with 39 doctors, nurses, people living with HIV, service providers and other experts. It focuses on the first 100 days after Pepfar-funded programmes were instructed to stop work as part of a US government freeze on foreign aid. Health workers reported shortages of drugs to control the virus, resulting in increased serious infections in people living with HIV and children being born with the virus because mothers could not get medication to prevent it being passed on. Clinics have closed, and people are skipping vital doses to eke out their supply of medication, raising the risk of drug-resistance. Some programmes have been able to resume activities in the months since the interviews, said Emily Bass, one of the report’s authors, offering “temporary mitigation” of the harms, but there exists a “narrow window” for the US Congress to act to secure resources that will stabilise remaining services and prevent the loss of decades of progress. The Trump administration is reportedly refusing to release about half of the $6bn (£4.5bn) funding allocated by Congress for Pepfar in the 2025 fiscal year. In Tanzania and Uganda, HIV prevention and treatment programmes were reliant on Pepfar. The stop work order meant clinics were unable to dispense drugs bought with US money for several days, before a waiver came through allowing treatment to continue. Even then, disruption to supply chains meant doctors could not dispense as many drugs as usual, they said, perhaps giving patients supplies for a few weeks rather than months. Rumours spread that normal access was unlikely to return. A mental health project research coordinator told PHR: “Someone did an abortion because of that rumour [that antiretrovirals were no longer available]. She said, ‘Oh well, I don’t want to have a baby who is HIV positive. I will be blamed myself, so I don’t want.’” By late April, one clinic reported that 25% of the pregnant women living with HIV that it supported had given birth to a child with HIV. Its clinician said drugs had not been delivered and existing stocks would not stretch far enough. The US government waiver allowed HIV prevention programmes to continue only for pregnant or breastfeeding women. It left key at-risk groups unprotected – in Tanzania and Uganda, LGBTQ+ people, sex workers and people who use drugs face criminalisation and stigma. Specialist services making it easier for them to access care have been hardest hit, the report found, warning of worsening discrimination when those people sought help from mainstream government clinics. The report also found that people’s trust in domestic government, US foreign aid and antiretroviral medications had been damaged. Many said they feared a “dark” future, anticipating increased costs for care and opportunists pushing fake cures. The US government must “immediately restore, renew, preserve and protect global health funding for essential HIV services, including full funding commensurate with need for global HIV programs in the FY 2026 budget, and subsequently reauthorise the Pepfar program”, the authors concluded, so that there can be “a planned, feasible, and transparent transition to country leadership and ownership of programs”.","2025-09-03T13:00:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/03/trumps-aid-cuts-in-east-africa-led-to-unwanted-abortions-and-babies-being-born-with-hiv-report"
"abortion","New Rio de Janeiro law requires public hospitals to display anti-abortion signs","A new law has just come into force in Rio de Janeiro requiring all public hospitals and clinics run by the municipal government to display anti-abortion signs bearing messages such as: “Did you know that the unborn child is discarded as hospital waste?” Reproductive rights activists view the act as the latest example of a growing trend across Brazil to further restrict access to abortion in a country that already has some of the world’s most restrictive laws. In Latin America’s largest country, abortion is only legal in cases of rape, when the pregnant person’s life is at risk, or if the foetus has anencephaly, a fatal brain disorder. In recent years, however, politicians, doctors and even judges have taken steps to prevent abortions even in those circumstances. Brazil’s main hospital for such procedures, in São Paulo, stopped offering terminations after a decision by the city’s mayor, a staunch supporter of former president Jair Bolsonaro, a strident anti-abortion advocate. A congressman from his party proposed a bill punishing abortions after 22 weeks – even in cases of rape or risk to life – with up to 20 years in prison. The federal medical council, which is reportedly dominated by Bolsonaro loyalists, last year banned doctors from using the safest method recommended by the World Health Organization for pregnancies over 22 weeks – a measure later deemed illegal by Brazil’s supreme court. “This is a direct result of the Bolsonaro years in power,” said anthropologist Debora Diniz, a professor at the University of Brasília and one of the country’s leading reproductive rights researchers and activists. She acknowledges that the dispute between pro- and anti-abortion positions is not new. Diniz herself had to leave the country in 2018 after receiving death threats for her involvement in a campaign to push the supreme court to discuss decriminalising abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy – a reform that ultimately stalled. What has changed now, she says, is that the issue, once confined to the federal level, has become “scattered” across local and regional authorities. “Authoritarian governments in Latin America have a particular trait: they don’t just disappear when their leader leaves office. Bolsonaro may be gone, but forces aligned with him and his ideas have occupied bodies like the medical council,” said Diniz. Such attempts are even more harmful given that legal abortion is not widely available across Brazil – only 4% of Brazilian cities have facilities and trained professionals to carry out the procedure, and that does not include even all state capitals. In the state of Goiás, a 13-year-old girl who had been raped turned to the courts after she was denied a legal abortion at a hospital, but a judge prohibited any method that would induce the death of the foetus. A higher court eventually authorised the abortion. In that state, the governor – also a Bolsonaro loyalist – signed a law requiring women seeking a legal abortion to first listen to the foetal heartbeat. Rio’s anti-abortion signs law was approved last Friday by Mayor Eduardo Paes – who is not a Bolsonaro supporter and is aligned with the current leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The mayor’s decision not to veto the law – which was proposed by three far-right city councillors – is being seen as a political move, as he is expected to run for state governor next year. Under the law, hospitals providing abortions must also display signs saying: “You have the right to give your baby up for adoption anonymously … Give life a chance!” and “Abortion can lead to consequences such as infertility, psychological problems, infections and even death.” Diniz said the second sign was even more problematic as there is no scientific evidence that abortion, when carried out safely and with medical support, causes any of those effects. “This law is perverse because it is based on a false narrative of ‘care’ for women and girls, when in fact it is persecuting them,” said Diniz. On Tuesday, a public prosecutor filed a lawsuit arguing that the law is unconstitutional and requesting that the city government be barred from putting up the signs. The case is yet to be reviewed by a judge.","2025-06-19T10:00:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/rio-de-janeiro-anti-abortion-signs"
"abortion","Medication abortions drove up number of US procedures after Roe’s repeal, study shows","An abortion provider shipped almost 120,000 packs of abortion pills to US residents between July 2023 and August 2024 – nearly 100,000 of whom lived in states that outlaw the procedure or have laws on the books that ban the mailing of abortion pills, according to a new study published in the prestigious medical journal Jama on Monday. To the shock of experts, the number of abortions performed in the US rose in the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban virtually all abortions. Much of that rise has been driven by the use of abortion pills, or medication abortion, and providers’ ability to supply the pills through telehealth. US abortion providers performed 1.14m abortions in 2024 – the highest number on record in recent years, according to data from #WeCount, a Society of Family Planning project. By the end of the year, #WeCount found, a full quarter of all abortions were being facilitated through telehealth. This study, which was led by a University of Texas at Austin professor and studied shipments from the telemedicine abortion service Aid Access, more fully fleshes out the portrait of US abortion access, as it is the first to examine abortion pill provision at the county level. The poorer a county was, the more likely its residents were to order abortion pills, researchers discovered. Counties where the poverty rates hovered between 10% and 20% had provision rates that were 1.63 times higher than counties where the poverty rate was lower than 5%. In counties where the poverty rate was above 20%, the provision rate was 1.93 times higher than in richer counties. Abortion pill provision rates were also more than three times higher in states that ban abortion compared with those that do not. In states that specifically ban telemedicine abortion, the provision rates were more than twice as high. Counties that were located farther from abortion clinics were also likely to see higher rates of abortion provision. Aid Access ships to all 50 US states through the use of “shield laws”, which have been adopted by a handful of blue states in the years since the repeal of Roe. These laws aim to guard abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions; if an abortion provider living in a state with a shield law ships pills across state lines, they are in theory protected from liability. But these laws have yet to be tested in court. Late last year, Texas sued a New York doctor over allegations that she had mailed abortion pills to a Texas woman. After the doctor, Margaret Carpenter, failed to show up for a court date, a judge ruled against her by default and ordered her pay a fine of more than $100,000. Citing New York’s shield law, a New York state clerk has repeatedly refused to enforce the fine. The Texas attorney general, Republican Ken Paxton, sued the clerk in July. Experts widely expect that the dispute, which tests the relationships between states that ban abortion and those that protect it, will eventually reach the US supreme court.","2025-08-11T15:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/medication-abortions-performed-study"
"abortion","MPs set to vote on decriminalising abortion in England and Wales","MPs are expected to vote on whether to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales this summer, with two Labour backbenchers to put forward amendments to government legislation to change the law. The Labour MPs Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy are believed to be putting forward separate amendments. For six decades, abortion in England and Wales has been largely governed by the Abortion Act 1967, which has allowed women to end their pregnancies under medical supervision up to 24 weeks, or beyond in certain circumstances, such as if the life of the mother is at risk or if the foetus has a serious abnormality. In 2020, emergency legislation introduced during the Covid pandemic brought in telemedicine and with it the biggest shake-up in abortion provision since 1967. Instead of women seeking an abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy needing to take the first pill under medical supervision, they could receive both pills by post after a remote consultation. It was made permanent in 2022, with MPs voting 215 in favour to 188 against. However, inducing a miscarriage remains a crime, punishable with up to life in prison, and in recent years several women have found themselves in the dock for ending their own pregnancies outside the strict legal parameters of the 1967 act. According to freedom of information data from the Crown Prosecution Service, 13 people made a first appearance at a magistrates court charged with abortion-related offences in 2022; four people in 2019; and three in each of 2020 and 2021. The numbers include both men and women. Separate data, from about half of Britain’s police forces, showed at least 11 people were arrested in 2023 on suspicion of child destruction or inducing a miscarriage, including a 31-year-old woman in north Wales “reported to have taken illicit substances to initiate an abortion”. Until 2022, it is believed that only three women had been convicted of having an illegal abortion in the 150 years since the introduction of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, under which illegal abortions are most commonly prosecuted. In the last parliament, MPs had put forward proposals to change the law under the criminal justice bill, with Creasy and a fellow Labour MP, Diana Johnson, proposing different changes to the law. However, the plans, along with the legislation, fell by the wayside with last summer’s general election. Johnson, now a Home Office minister, can no longer table amendments to government legislation. Antoniazzi’s amendment is believed to be similar in scope to the one put forward by Johnson in the last parliament. It is the second so-called vote of conscience in quick succession, with assisted dying legislation expected to come before the Commons before any abortion vote. In a referendum in 2018, Ireland made abortion legal on request up to 12 weeks, and later if the foetus would be likely to die before or shortly after birth or if there was a risk of death or serious harm to a pregnant woman. In 2019, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws were also modernised, allowed up to 12 weeks – and later under limited circumstances. However, in the US, change has gone in the opposite direction. In June 2022, the supreme court ruled that there was no constitutional right to abortion, with the laws now decided at state level. About 22 million women of reproductive age have had access restricted, with abortion banned in more than a dozen states. Whether either of the amendments are selected for debate and put to a vote will be a matter for the speaker. But with broad cross-party support for a change in the law, it is likely there will be a vote on the issue. “In the last five years, around 100 women have been investigated by police for a ‘crime’ that does not even apply in two nations of the United Kingdom,” Antoniazzi told the Guardian. “The damage this outdated law is inflicting upon women affected is immeasurable. I feel a moral imperative to act. I am leading a cross-party group of parliamentarians and have been working with the sector on the reform we desperately need to put a stop to this. I will be laying an amendment in that vein to the crime and policing bill in the coming weeks.” Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said: “BPAS, alongside a coalition of royal colleges, medical bodies and women’s rights groups, are calling on MPs to reform our archaic abortion law and end the prosecution of women accused of ending their own pregnancies. We fully supported the amendment tabled by Diana Johnson MP to the criminal justice bill in 2024 and we hope that this parliament will take these proposals forward as a matter of urgency.” Creasy’s amendment seeks to write a human right to access abortion into law. “Other countries have enshrined a human right to access abortion – doing that here and writing this right into law for the first time ever could help prevent any rollback in rights and provide a future for ensuring everyone can access a safe and legal abortion if they choose to do so,” she said.","2025-05-01T12:50:13Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/01/mps-to-vote-on-decriminalisation-of-abortion-in-england-and-wales"
"abortion","Why abortion rights in the UK are getting more and more perilous","Earlier this month, Nicola Packer was found not guilty of illegally terminating a pregnancy, after taking abortion pills beyond the legal limit of 10 weeks. She had spent more than four years living in the shadow of this prosecution, every detail of which – as reported by Phoebe Davis – is completely harrowing. In 2020, Packer was arrested before she left Chelsea and Westminster hospital, still bleeding from major surgery. Packer is one of six women to be prosecuted for this crime in England since the end of 2022, under the Offences Against the Person Act, which had previously only been used in such cases three times since its introduction in 1861. Even that striking, inexplicable figure doesn’t begin to describe how many people have fallen victim to these prosecutions. There have been cases of women denied contact with their children while police investigated a charge that came to nothing. A teenager who had a late miscarriage was arrested in front of her entire street – her privacy, her education, her peace of mind completely destroyed. The consequences are so dire if you get caught in this net that informed women would rightly think twice about being honest with healthcare professionals – so quality of care is undermined for everyone. And while attempts are being made in parliament to take abortion legislation out of criminal law altogether, so that no woman is ever prosecuted in this intrusive and barbaric way in the future, as things stand at the moment, the situation is getting more perilous for women, not less. Campaigners in the field – notably Jonathan Lord, who is co-chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists abortion taskforce, and Hayley Webb, co-chair of Doctors for Choice UK – believe that some midwives and nurses are mistaken or confused about their duty of patient confidentiality. Abortion providers such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) wonder whether the emergency measures taken during Covid – to allow abortion pills to be prescribed remotely, rather than in person – have ushered in new anxiety around women’s autonomy. Last December the National Police Chiefs’ Council issued new guidance on “child death investigation”, advising that women’s devices be checked for period tracker apps, Google searches, any communications that might “establish a woman’s knowledge and intention in relation to the pregnancy”. When Hampshire police found a human placenta in woodland in 2023, they asked BPAS for a full list of women who had made inquiries about a termination and then disengaged. BPAS was astonished by the request – it could have swept in hundreds of women, and didn’t even have the legitimacy of a court order. Sometimes it is the police that seem overzealous, as in Packer’s case; the Crown Prosecution Service wanted to drop it, and the Met successfully appealed that decision. Ultimately, though, it would be far-fetched to try to chase down a new anti-abortion tendency in assorted police forces. If there are increasing numbers of investigations and prosecutions, which there are, it is for the director of public prosecutions for England and Wales to explain why. Two years ago, I sought that explanation from the then DPP, Max Hill KC. The most formulaic response came back: he said he had “a duty to ensure that laws set by parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions”. This law having been in place for more than 150 years, further explanation would have been helpful as to why that duty had become so pressing after 2020. Hill was succeeded the same year by Stephen Parkinson, who is now being urged by campaigners to do a more robust public interest test on cases like Packer’s. Many women’s groups question whether there is ever a public interest case for prosecuting a woman under these circumstances. It remains unknown what is driving these prosecutions, between an excess of caution post-Covid, a new wave of cultural misogyny finding its expression in reproductive surveillance, and a failure of institutional memory on the part of some healthcare workers as to what their duties are to their patients – or all these factors and more in some tangled feedback loop. Whatever the cause, everyone must now do their bit. Parliamentarians must take abortion out of the criminal law altogether, and the law itself, in the meantime, must rediscover its proportionality and reason. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"abortion","RFK Jr orders mifepristone review as anti-abortion groups push for ban","The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said on Wednesday that he had directed the FDA to review the regulations around the abortion pill mifepristone. The review, he said, was necessary due to “new data” – data that emerged from a flawed analysis that top US anti-abortion groups are now using to pressure the Trump administration to reimpose restrictions on the abortion pill, if not pull it from the market entirely. “It’s alarming,” Kennedy told the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, during a congressional hearing. “Clearly, it indicates that, at very least, the label should be changed.” The analysis, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, came after the Food and Drug Administration commissioner said he was open to reviewing new safety data on the pills, which are used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide. The conservative organizations are rallying behind a paper published on 28 April by a rightwing thinktank, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims there are higher complication rates from taking mifepristone than previously known. The paper has attracted scrutiny for appearing to dramatically overstate what it characterizes as “serious adverse effects” associated with the pill, according to medical experts. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining – as a serious complication. Mifepristone does not cause an ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients are counseled in advance about the pills’ failure rate of about 3 to 4%. The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy – but they do not intend to stop there. The authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help “determine whether this drug should remain on the market”, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member. Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an “interim step” to revoking mifepristone’s approval altogether. More than 100 scientific studies have found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy. Telehealth, plus blue-state “shield laws”, have enabled thousands of people living in states where abortion is banned to continue to access mifepristone and misoprostol, which frustrates abortion opponents. One in five abortions nationwide are done via telemedicine, and in spring 2024, mail providers facilitated more than 7,700 abortions per month in states with total or six-week abortion bans. Anti-abortion leaders said during a private Zoom call that they intend to use the EPPC paper to pressure the FDA and lawmakers to dramatically roll back access to the drug, “if not suspend” their approval entirely, Politico reported. It is part of a plan they are privately calling “Rolling Thunder”. Activists on that call – which included representatives from Americans United for Life, Live Action, Students for Life, and Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America – stressed that they viewed ending telemedicine prescriptions only as a “first step”. According to the Politico report, the EPPC president, Ryan Anderson, argued on the call that this plan aligns with Donald Trump’s stated desire to leave abortion policy to the states because, he said, “you’re not leaving it to states if California can mail pills to Texas”. Activists tried to push back on criticism that the paper was not peer-reviewed by arguing that academia is “broken” and they could not trust journals or reviewers not to “sabotage” their effort or leak it to the press. Politico reported that one medical professional on the call, Christina Francis, the CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs, warned her colleagues not to misrepresent the paper, acknowledging that the report was “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything”. Still, Francis argued that it warranted government action and more research. During his January confirmation hearing, Kennedy said that Trump asked him to review mifepristone’s safety data. The FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, said in March that he, too, would “do a review of the data”, and would act if necessary. Hawley, the Missouri senator, later wrote a letter to Makary asking him to review the paper the day it was published; Hawley also introduced a bill to end telemedicine of mifepristone. It is not expected to pass Congress, but the FDA could take action on its own, especially under pressure from groups on the call. While abortion opponents have promoted research linked to anti-abortion thinktanks claiming that mifepristone is dangerous, some studies have been retracted, including one cited heavily by a federal judge in a case seeking to roll back the pill’s availability that went to the supreme court last term. The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors, did not have legal standing to sue the FDA. That case is still ongoing, with three Republican attorneys general suing the FDA on behalf of the states of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas. The Trump administration made news last week when it argued in a filing that the judge should dismiss the case, the same position taken by the Biden administration earlier this year. But the Trump administration did not defend the FDA’s actions on mifepristone, instead saying only that the plaintiffs were not the right people to sue. As a health law expert recently told the Guardian, the administration could use that argument in the future if it chooses to restrict the drug and Democratic-led states sue over the changes. Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project, told the Guardian she was not surprised by either the existence of a plan to restrict the drugs or that the push is based on what she called “manufactured misinformation”. Moore said that reproductive rights supporters had long known that anti-abortion advocates “will stop at nothing to put mifepristone – a safe, effective FDA-approved medication that has been used for 25 years in this country to end a pregnancy at 10 weeks or less – back under lock and key”.

"abortion","Bill to restrict abortions later in pregnancy defeated in South Australia after emotional debate","A bill to restrict access to abortion after 22 weeks and six days has been defeated in the South Australian parliament. The former One Nation MLC Sarah Game, who is now an independent, worked with the controversial anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe on the legislation that went before the SA parliament on Wednesday night. It was voted down by 11 votes to eight. Several MLCs became visibly distressed and tearful during the debate on Wednesday evening. The attorney general, Kyam Maher, referred to comments from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog) that the bill was premised either on an ignorance of reality or a wilful misrepresentation of the facts. “I can only imagine the pain and anguish that mothers and families must experience when having such a difficult decision so late in a pregnancy for a variety of complex and very deeply personal reasons,” he said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The current law allows abortions from 23 weeks when there is significant risk to the physical or mental health of the mother. Game’s proposed amendment bill would have watered that down to only allow abortion where it would save the life of the mother or another foetus, or if there was a significant risk of foetal abnormalities. She said if a mother’s life was at risk or her health threatened, doctors should do an emergency caesarean or induce labour so the baby is born alive. “Let’s be clear about what good medical practice looks like,” she said when she introduced the legislation. “In a genuine emergency, where a mother’s life is at risk – for example, with extreme pre-eclampsia, or even in non-emergency situations where her physical health is threatened – the safest and most effective treatment is to end the pregnancy by delivering the child alive.” Independent MLC Tammy Franks told parliament that would then disallow abortion in cases of young girls, women who were prevented from accessing earlier abortions, in cases of domestic violence, including in cases of the abuse of minors and vulnerable adults, and in cases of sexual and physical violence including rape, incest and sexual slavery, as well as deteriorating maternal physical health. The Liberal MLC Michelle Lensink voted against the bill and said the facts were settled, that the bill undermined “one of the fundamental principles in health decision-making, which is informed consent for the patient”, and that the policies of “a certain US administration” were not “contagious”. Howe has been banned from the state parliament indefinitely after alleged “threatening and intimidating tactics” over a different later abortion bill introduced last year by the Liberal MLC Ben Hood. The Legislative Council president, Terry Stephens, said in parliament at the time it was “entirely unacceptable for visitors to roam the corridors and other areas adjacent to the chamber unaccompanied. It is even more unacceptable that any member should feel intimidated or threatened by visitors while carrying out their free performance as a member of the council.” Howe denied she had done anything wrong. “I refute every allegation that has been made, and I’ll be considering my options in terms of what I can do to challenge it,” Howe said at the time. She has subsequently requested that her response to the decision to ban her be read in the parliament – which has not occurred – but otherwise it is unclear whether she has formally challenged the ban. Maher said in parliament on Wednesday the last time later abortion had been debated – after which Howe was banned from the building – was the most unedifying he had seen. Experts have said anti-abortion tactics from the US that focus on later abortion – which happens rarely, and for medical reasons – are being imported to Australia to “chip away at rights”. The Liberal MLC Nicola Centofanti voted for the bill and said it “represents a reasonable and compassionate safeguard, a clear restriction on late-term terminations while maintaining the ability to provide appropriate medical care and compassion where circumstances require”. Ranzcog said the bill was “based on a fundamental misunderstanding” of the “extraordinarily rare” procedure, which “almost always invariably involve circumstances of severe foetal abnormalities incompatible with life, or serious threats to the pregnant woman’s health and life”. The South Australian Abortion Action Coalition has referred to the bill as introducing “forced birth”. Co-convenor Brigid Coombe said the failure of Wednesday’s bill and of last year’s was a reminder “that these anti-abortion MLCs are out of touch with the SA community’s expectation and appreciation of evidence-based and compassionate healthcare”. It comes less than a fortnight after a similar, ill-fated federal move, which Howe also claimed credit for. The Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce and Liberal backbencher Andrew Hastie were among those suggesting a law to allow parental leave after a stillbirth would be used by women needing an abortion later in pregnancy. • This article was amended on 13 November 2025.

"abortion","Conservatives are trumpeting a new abortion-pill study. One problem: it’s bogus","Almost two-thirds of US abortions are induced with pills. The drug mifepristone blocks the pregnancy hormone progesterone, ending the growth of the fetus. Mifepristone was designed for abortions: its primary purpose, from its development through its regulatory approval and now on the market, has always been to allow women to control their own bodies and lives by ending their pregnancies. Because it exists as a tool of women’s independence, mifepristone has been the object of controversy, misinformation and intense scrutiny for the entirety of its existence. Originally synthesized by French pharmaceutical researchers in 1980, the drug went through a rigorous, prolonged and heavily politicized approval process in the US, and wasn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the US market until 2000. The anti-abortion movement – including several prominent Republican lawmakers – is looking to undo that. Since the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that eliminated the nationwide right to abortion, women living in anti-choice states have relied increasingly on mifepristone, particularly pills shipped by mail from providers in pro-choice states who prescribe the drug via telehealth. It is estimated that as many as 20% of abortions in the US are now accessed via telehealth appointments, a technological marvel that has allowed many people living in anti-choice states to avert the worst consequences to their lives, health and dignity that were threatened by the Dobbs decision by circumventing the unjust abortion bans that their states have attempted to impose on them. Dobbs has already been devastating for American women, causing needless deaths, driving up maternal mortality, derailing women’s lives, constraining their prospects, and injuring their standing as equal citizens. The post-2022 explosion of telehealth abortion using mifepristone is the reason why the consequences have not been even worse. Now, Trump’s new FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, is under pressure to restrict access to the drug. Pressed by reporters at the Semafor World Economy Summit late last month, Makaray said that he had “no plans” to review the status of mifepristone. But he added a crucial caveat: that he would reconsider the drug’s accessibility if new information emerged about the drug’s safety. “If the data suggests something or tells us that there’s a real signal, we can’t promise that we’re not going to act on that data,” he said. As if on cue, a conservative thinktank published a new study just days later that purported to find that mifepristone caused serious adverse effects in more than 10% of patients. The study – which contradicts all previous tests of the drug and the resounding consensus of the medical field – was published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing advocacy group that aims to “apply the richness of the Jewish and Christian traditions to contemporary questions of law” and “push back against the extreme progressive agenda while building a consensus for conservatives”. The study was rapidly amplified on conservative social media, and was pushed by several Republican senators who had previously called on Makaray to ban mifepristone at his March confirmation hearing. Missouri’s Josh Hawley, the author of a book on “manhood” who once raised a fist in solidarity with the January 6 insurrectionists, declared in a statement directed at Makaray: “Well, the new data is here. And it’s a signal that can’t be missed: Mifepristone is not safe.” Hawley went on to urge the FDA to restrict access to the drug and revert to pre-pandemic regulations, in which mifepristone could only be dispensed by a doctor after multiple in-person visits: a regulatory regime that would cut off abortion access to millions of women in anti-choice states. But the study that is being proposed as a pretext for restricting abortion access has come under scrutiny from doctors and statisticians for its questionable methodology. Drawing from insurance claim data from 2017 to 2023, the EPPC study claims that 10% of women who take mifepristone experience “sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, an emergency room visit, or another serious adverse event within 45 days”. This would be alarming if it were true, but it isn’t. Instead, the study seems to have been designed to dramatically overstate the side-effects of mifepristone, in part by counting the normal and intended functioning of the drug – such as vaginal bleeding as the pregnancy terminates and post-medication doctor visits to confirm the completion of the miscarriage – as serious adverse effects. The study also claimed that a vast range of health experiences in the 45 days following the medication – such as mental health symptoms – were caused by the drug, a claim that the data does not support. The EPPC study also seems to include those who were prescribed mifepristone for non-abortion uses, such as miscarriage management, as well as those who took it alone, without the standard misoprostol dose that accompanies it. The study is not peer-reviewed and has not been published in a medical journal, because its authors could not meet the standards that such publication requires: their work is not up to snuff. Dr Stella Dantas, the president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, called the paper “seriously flawed” and said that it “manipulates data to drive a myth that medication abortion isn’t safe”. The truth is that abortion pills have a lower rate of serious complications than Tylenol, and that the anti-abortion movement is in fact a great danger to American women’s health. It is because of abortion bans – not abortion access – that women in America are facing dramatically rising rates of “sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging” and death in pregnancy. In Texas alone, the rate of sepsis in pregnant women experiencing second-trimester miscarriages increased by more than 50% in the years since the state’s near-total abortion ban went into effect, and experts say that the laws prohibiting abortion are the cause. The adverse effects that the anti-abortion movement sees in mifepristone’s availability is not a matter of women’s health, which they are indifferent to. It is women’s freedom.

"abortion","GOP nominee for Virginia governor tries to distance herself from anti-abortion past","The Republican nominee for governor of Virginia has recently tried to distance herself from her long-standing, hardline anti-abortion record, declining recently to state whether she would support any restrictions on abortion access if she is elected to lead the state this fall. But her record reveals a candidate staunchly opposed to the procedure. Winsome Earle-Sears, now the state’s lieutenant governor, supported a 15-week abortion ban and has previously said she wants to make abortion illegal in almost all cases. In audio obtained by the Guardian, Earle-Sears also suggested an equivalence between consenting to sex and consenting to pregnancy. Virginia is the only state in the US south without a strict abortion ban, and abortion is legal in the state through the end of the second trimester of pregnancy. The state’s current Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, previously failed to build support for a 15-week abortion ban, a framework Earle-Sears endorsed. While campaigning for lieutenant governor in January 2021, before Roe v Wade was overturned and support for abortion rights rose among the US public, Earle-Sears told a reporter that she considered abortion to be “genocide” and that she wanted to make abortion illegal in all cases unless the mother’s life was at risk. But she has recently struck a different tone. In a local news interview last week, a reporter with WRIC 8News asked Earle-Sears about her past support for limiting abortion access. She replied: “I never said limiting access.” Sears, who is Black, then referenced abortion rates among Black women and asked: “Who doesn’t want us to have babies?” When asked if she would sign a law banning abortion at 15 weeks or less, Earle-Sears said: “We’re not limiting access at all. That’s not what we’re saying. As a matter of fact, what we really need to do is get together and try to figure out, where is the limit?” Virginians broadly support abortion rights, with 71% saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases per a 2023 Public Religion Research Institute survey. The interview comes as some GOP strategists told Politico that Earle-Sears is struggling to make traction, citing slow fundraising and controversial comments connecting slavery to diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Her campaign wrote in a fundraising email: “Slaves did not die in the fields so that we could call ourselves victims now in 2025.” Polling shows Earle-Sears trailing the Democratic nominee, former representative Abigail Spanberger, by nearly seven points according to polling averages. Virginia gubernatorial races often swing in the opposite direction of the presidency. Earle-Sears may be attempting to strike a softer tone on abortion in advance of the November election, but she has made hardline anti-abortion statements for years. In a little-noticed radio interview from June 2022, Earle-Sears suggested to then conservative radio host John Reid, now the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, that women consenting to sex are consenting to pregnancy. “We need to make our choices before we’re pregnant, not, you know, after,” she said, just days after the supreme court overturned Roe. “You already made a choice.” That comment was of a piece with other past statements. In September 2021, Earle-Sears said on Newsmax that she supported a six-week abortion ban like the one that had just taken effect in Texas. Her campaign website’s “issues” page previously included an anti-abortion section where she referred to “late-term abortion” as murder. (Abortion opponents use that term to refer to abortions later in pregnancy; in obstetrics, “late term” refers to a pregnancy after 40 weeks.) She scrubbed the site of that section in 2021. Most recently, Earle-Sears, who is required as the state’s senate president to add her signature to bills that pass the legislature, added a note to a constitutional amendment to codify abortion rights that the legislature passed in May. The Virginia Mercury reported that she wrote above her signature: “I am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child.” The amendment must pass the legislature again next year before it can go to voters. The Earle-Sears campaign declined to comment on the record on her recent interview as well as the 2022 interview. Reid, the lieutenant governor nominee, has been mired in his own scandal for allegedly maintaining a social media account featuring photos of nude men. Governor Youngkin asked him to drop out of the race, but Reid, Virginia’s first openly gay candidate for statewide office, has denied connection to the photos and claimed that attempts to push him constitute discrimination against his sexual orientation. Following news of the photos, Earle-Sears cancelled events with Reid. News also broke that, last year, she wrote a note on a marriage equality bill saying that she was “morally opposed” to same-sex marriage. Politico described the relationship between the two nominees at the Republican ticket as “frosty”.","2025-05-30T11:00:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/abortion-winsome-earle-sears-virginia-governor-candidate"
"abortion","‘Utterly traumatised’: anger at ordeal of UK woman accused of illegal abortion","When Nicola Packer took a pregnancy test in November 2020, as the country was in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic, she did not even believe she was pregnant. Aged 41 at the time, she thought it more likely that she was perimenopausal, but had been feeling under the weather and when her friend – with whom the pregnancy had been conceived – suggested she took a test, she only did so to “prove him wrong”. When the test, bought from a chemist around the corner, came back positive, she was “shocked”, but was never in any doubt about what to do. She had never wanted children, and immediately sought a termination. Under emergency provisions introduced during the pandemic – which were later made permanent – abortion pills could be dispatched by post, following a remote consultation, in pregnancies up to 10 weeks’ gestation. She took the pills, thinking, as her defence barrister, Fiona Horlick KC, told Isleworth crown court, “that she would only see blood clots to look into the toilet bowl”, but to her shock, hours later, she delivered “a small but fully formed baby”. This in itself was a traumatic event for Packer, but it would pale in comparison to what followed. She attended A&amp;E at Charing Cross hospital, bleeding and in shock. Staff told her she was in the wrong hospital and to go to Chelsea and Westminster instead, but did not provide an ambulance and left her to make her own way there. She had brought the foetus with her, but did not immediately tell staff that she had taken abortion medication, because she feared it would affect the care she received. When she later admitted that she had taken the pills, informing a midwife who had told Packer “she was there to care for her, that her safety was their priority and that whatever happened they were there to support her”, the police were called in. Uniformed officers arrived at the hospital, and Packer, still recovering from surgery after the birth, was arrested. She was taken into custody and her computers and phone were seized. It was the start of an ordeal that would stretch for four and a half years, culminating in her standing in the dock, giving evidence as part of her two-week trial. For periods of the trial Packer was able to stand with composure and a sense of quiet pride. Often, however, this was stripped away under a barrage of deeply personal questioning, as the prosecution asked her to relive one of the worst days of her life, scrutinising every detail she said she could not recall. Though she seemed steady and stoic at times, she would sometimes give way to tears. When she gave evidence, Packer was joined in court by a small group of friends, who held her hand as she walked into the courtroom and escorted her out whenever she left, be it at the end of the day, or to take a break from her interrogation. At one point, the presiding judge was forced to send the jury away and reprimand Packer’s support group for tutting too loudly and rolling their eyes during a particularly intense, and in their eyes inappropriate, line of questioning. As the trial came to a close, addressing the jury of three men and nine women for the final time, Horlick said her client was still “utterly traumatised”. “The facts of this case are a tragedy but they are not a crime,” she said. While the prosecution may be over, Packer, now 45, will be irreparably changed by the ordeal. The most private details of her life were aired in public – her medical history including past terminations, her sexual preferences, a tragic baby loss in her family, and even intimate photographs of her – shown by the defence to the jury to prove that she did not look pregnant. In the coming days, there will be questions asked of the Crown Prosecution Service, which brought the case to trial despite Judge Edmunds KC urging the CPS to review whether there was a public interest in trying the case “four and a half years after events”. At a pre-trial hearing, Edmunds, the recorder of Kensington who presided over the case, said there was a “heavy burden” on the prosecution, particularly given backlogs in the courts system. Jonathan Lord, an NHS consultant gynaecologist and the clinician in charge of Packer’s care while working at MSI Reproductive Choices, said: “This was a vindictive and brutal prosecution in which the CPS weaponised victim-shaming. Wholly unnecessary details of Nicola’s relationships and sex life were prominent in the prosecution’s opening statement, made in the full knowledge they would be widely reported in the press. “The police played several recordings of her confidential medical consultations in open court. “CCTV footage was shown of her arriving at A&amp;E in considerable distress. Packer had to show the court intimate photographs of herself in her defence, all while sat in a packed courtroom as the jury viewed the images. No woman should ever have to endure institutionalised public shaming and humiliation, let alone in 2025 in England.” The case has furthered calls for a change in the law, which could come as soon as this summer, with two backbench Labour MPs set to lay amendments to the criminal justice bill, seeking to decriminalise abortion. One of the MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi, who spent a day in court during Packer’s trial, said: “It must be an immense relief for Nicola to have avoided conviction, but it is completely unacceptable that she was forced to endure the indignity and turmoil of a trial. Having met Nicola at the crown court recently, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact that this cruel and unnecessary investigation has had on her life over the last four and a half years. “The true injustice here is the years of her life stolen by a law written decades before women had the vote, for a ‘crime’ which doesn’t even apply in two nations of the United Kingdom. “Nicola’s experience, in her own words, includes being taken from her hospital bed to a police cell, denied timely access to essential medical care, and spending every penny she had on lawyers defending her case. This is utterly deplorable, and it is not justice. I do not see how this law can be defended any longer.” Lord said: “Every agency Nicola needed turned against her. In this, as in other cases, the teams charged with treating, protecting and safeguarding vulnerable women and girls have done the most harm, breaking confidentiality and treating victims as criminals. “The issue is not simply that Nicola had the misfortune of encountering some callous organisations or individuals, but that our current abortion laws directed and encouraged the actions taken against her. “The law is causing life-changing harm to the women involved, and in some cases their children too. “What’s happening, the horrific way the women and their children are being treated – including those with premature labours and natural later pregnancy losses – is a national scandal.”","2025-05-08T14:31:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/08/anger-ordeal-woman-accused-abortion-nicola-packer"
"abortion","Trump plan to invite Netanyahu to Gaza summit aborted after Erdoğan warning","A last-minute plan by Donald Trump to invite Benjamin Netanyahu to a multinational Gaza summit in Egypt had to be aborted after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he would not land his plane in Sharm el-Sheikh if the invitation stood. The mid-air power struggle started after it was announced that the Israeli prime minister had accepted a late invitation from Trump to the conference being jointly chaired by the US president and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Egypt. Netanyahu’s presence at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh had apparently been sealed by Trump in a phone call from Israel on Monday morning with Sisi. It is not clear if Erdoğan’s refusal to land for the summit was the cause of Netanyahu changing his plans, but it is known that he spoke to Sisi to raise his objections from his plane above Egypt. A statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said: “Prime Minister Netanyahu was invited by US President Trump to participate in a conference taking place today in Egypt. The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation but stated that he would not be able to attend due to the proximity of the event to the start of the holiday.” Figures on the extreme right in Netanyahu’s coalition government had also threatened to resign if he went to the conference. International criminal court arrest warrants have been issued against Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza, and while Egypt is not a signatory to the court, his presence at the summit would have been contentious, including among those Arab states that have not normalised relations with Israel. More than 20 world leaders were due to attend the hastily arranged summit. The row about Netanyahu’s presence shows how hard it will be for some Muslim countries to normalise relations with Israel in the way Trump wants. Pictures of Erdoğan negotiating with Netanyahu or shaking hands with the Israeli leader would have been disastrous for the Turkish leader domestically, and would have also led to questions about Ankara’s planned role in the international stabilisation force that is due to look after security in Gaza. Erdoğan has repeatedly called Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide.","2025-10-13T13:56:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/trump-invite-netanyahu-gaza-summit-aborted-erdogan-warning"
"abortion","A baby born to a brain dead mother: this is the horror of abortion bans","On Friday 13 June, a baby was born in an Atlanta hospital to a woman who had been dead for four months. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old Black nurse and mother, was declared brain dead in February after blood clots formed in her brain. Legally, and by all meaningful measures, she was dead then: the woman who loved her family, laughed with her friends, comforted her son, helped her colleagues and cared for her patients was gone then, and was never coming back. But the state of Georgia, and the administrators of the hospital where she was declared dead, kept her corpse in a state of artificial animation for months. That’s because when Smith went to the hospital in February complaining of a headache, and later became unresponsive, she was about eight weeks pregnant. According to her family, doctors at Emory hospital, in Georgia, told the family that the state’s abortion ban required them to maintain the regimen that falsely animated their daughter’s corpse so that the fetus inside her could continue to grow. The Georgia state attorney general denies that the state’s abortion ban required this abuse of Smiths’s body. But other supporters of the law disagree. The result, either way, was the same: in deference to a law that created genuine ambiguity about what freedoms Smith’s doctors and family had in the wake of her death, a woman who did nothing other than be pregnant was denied the right to rest in peace. Brain death is distinct from a vegetative state or a coma; it is the complete and permanent loss of the function of the entire brain, including the loss of the function of the brain stem, which is needed for basic organ functions like the reflexive intake of breath and the beating of the heart. There is no chance of recovery; usually, the invasive life support required to sustain the body of a brain dead patient is administered only long enough for the patient’s family to say goodbye. That’s because what life support does to a patient’s body, in addition to being medically futile, is also extreme and invasive. The artificial ventilator that acts as a bellows, pushing air in and out of the dead lungs, involves tubes inserted through the nose and throat, extending into the stomach and windpipe. These tubes, in Smith’s case, were tools of the state, extending the force of the law into the inside of her corpse. It was the state, via these machines, that pumped her heart, contracted her lungs, and pushed blood into the dead tissues of her body, so that cells could continue dividing inside her uterus. It was the state that used these machines to desecrate Smith’s corpse – to turn it from the vessel for a beautiful person, the nurse and mother, into an object that symbolized women’s degradation and Smith’s disposability. What should have been a respected artifact of a loved person became a macabre marionette, pushed and pulled by a state apparatus that sees all women’s bodies as mere means to its own ends. Last month, the fetus was cut out of her corpse prematurely; presumably, doctors did not think that the dead body could sustain a pregnancy any longer. Physicians working on Smith’s case told her family that as a result of gestating inside a dead uterus, the resulting child could experience health complications ranging from blindness to the inability to walk. The infant that was extracted from the dead woman, a baby boy, weighs less than 2lbs, and is currently in neonatal intensive care. The family has named him Chance. The desecration of Smith’s corpse by Emory University hospital and the state of Georgia is a grim reminder of how little women’s personhood is esteemed in post-Dobbs America. But Adriana is not the first woman to have her dead body abused this way. In 2013, a 33-year-old Texas woman, Marlise Muñoz, was declared brain dead after suffering a pulmonary embolism. Because she was 14 weeks pregnant, the hospital argued that the state of Texas required her to be kept on life support, solely so that her corpse could be used to continue the cultivation of the fetus. Her husband, Erick, sued to have her removed from life support so that he could bury his wife and grieve in peace; still, the hospital artificially animated her corpse until a judge ordered them to stop. Marlise’s family would tell reporters that as they visited her body in the hospital, they could smell her flesh decaying. There is something particularly unsettling about seeing a corpse: the absence of the person who was once there is so conspicuous that it makes the body uncanny. That the body is not the person becomes clear the moment you see a body without a human person in it. And yet the body is the instrument and vessel of the person who animates it, and as such it commands to be treated with dignity, with a kind of reverence, with the respect you would give to a human being. Abortion bans disregard this: they appropriate the body for the ends of the state, indifferent to the will or the dignity of the person who lives in it. Rape functions this way, too – using a body for an end, without deferring to the person who inhabits it. In both cases – rape and abortion bans – the body of a living person is reduced to an instrument for someone else’s use. That contrast – between the dignity that a human being’s body demands and the instrumentalization with which it is treated – is what supplies abortion bans and sexual violence with their moral horror. They treat living people as mere objects. In that sense, a corpse might be the perfect vehicle for the anti-abortion movement’s agenda: it is a female instrument without the annoying encumbrance of a female person. But Adriana Smith was a person; so was Marlise Muñoz. They were not objects, or instruments; they were people endowed with dignity and rights. In life and in death, they deserved better. Every woman does. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist","2025-07-08T11:00:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/08/adriana-smith-atlanta-brain-dead-birth"
"abortion","Abortion laws in England and Wales face biggest shake-up in nearly 60 years","Parliament is set to vote on whether to decriminalise abortion on Tuesday, in what would be the biggest shake-up to reproductive rights in England and Wales in almost 60 years. Fierce battles have been fought behind the scenes, with Labour backbenchers Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy lobbying in an effort to have their rival amendments taken forward for a vote. It is understood only one will be voted on, and with Antoniazzi’s being the lead amendment on the order paper, it is more than likely that hers will be selected. The amendments, due to be considered during the report stage of the crime and policing bill, would see the biggest change to abortion law since the Abortion Act of 1967. “Inducing a miscarriage” remains a criminal offence, with the Abortion Act setting out strict criteria under which terminations can legally take place. Calls for law reform have increased in recent years, alongside an increased number of prosecutions of women suspected of illegal abortions. Antoniazzi’s amendment has a higher number of backers, with more than 170 names, and significant cross-party support, with signatories from parties including Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the SDLP and the Conservatives. If both the amendment and its parent bill are passed, it would mean women would no longer be prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies. However, it would not change the framework by which abortion is accessed, with time limits, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion and the requirement for two doctors’ approval all remaining in place. Among the organisations supporting a change in the law are the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association. “Under the current laws, women who have experienced unexplained pregnancy loss may also be vulnerable to criminal investigation, and health professionals placed under unacceptable and unwarranted scrutiny,” Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said. “Worryingly, the fear of being investigated by the police may deter women from seeking urgent medical attention. “We believe this is not in the public interest and that these women should be treated with care and compassion, without judgment or fear of imprisonment.” Sarah Salkeld, deputy medical director at MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO providing contraception and safe abortion services, said: “In no other part of healthcare do you face prison potentially by taking a medical treatment.” She said that during what is often a “very upsetting scenario already”, police investigations “can turn people’s lives upside down” and that some women have spent months or years under investigation before cases were dropped. Salkeld said “the vast majority of people are under 10 weeks” when they have a termination, but that those who access abortion outside the legal framework are “potentially very vulnerable people” such as those in abusive relationships, or who have serious mental health problems. Creasy’s more complex amendment seeks to go further, also removing doctors from the criminal law, and seeking to prevent abortion law from being changed by a future parliament. Several MPs have signed both amendments, although in recent days some have withdrawn their name from Creasy’s, following public and private lobbying. There has been disquiet among MPs and campaigners about the rival amendments, dividing a camp of people who essentially want to achieve the same aim. There are worries the row over the right way to improve women’s rights will in fact have the opposite effect, and draw attention to what can be a divisive issue. Reform leader Nigel Farage said the current 24-week time limit is “utterly ludicrous”. The British Pregnancy Advice Service (Bpas) has been one of the most vocal supporters of Antoniazzi’s amendment – and a vocal critic of Creasy’s. The second of the country’s biggest abortion providers, MSI Reproductive Choices, is also backing the Antoniazzi amendment, which Louise McCudden, UK head of external affairs said, “is designed to fix a very specific, urgent problem that we’re seeing at the moment, which is women facing criminal investigation and prison for ending their own pregnancies. “Getting abortion law reform right will take time … we don’t want to rush that. But also, the women who are being investigated and facing prosecution and jail can’t afford to wait.” She added that the vote would represent “a massive milestone”. “We see in the United States with rollbacks on reproductive rights and rollbacks on gender equality,” she said. “So it sends a really powerful signal, not just to women here, that they’re being supported, [but] also to countries around the world … that the rollback isn’t inevitable.” • This article was amended on 17 June 2025. An earlier version said that the Royal College of Surgeons supported a change in the law; however, this organisation has not made a statement on the matter.","2025-06-16T18:36:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/abortion-laws-in-england-and-wales-face-biggest-shake-up-in-nearly-60-years"
"abortion","Texas charges eight people over links to midwife accused of illegal abortions","Eight people linked to a Texas midwife accused of performing illegal abortions have been arrested, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, announced on Wednesday. The midwife, Maria Rojas, earlier this year became the first person to be charged under Texas laws that outlaw virtually all abortions. She is now facing three counts of performing an abortion and 12 counts of practicing medicine without a license. The new arrests were all of people indicted for practicing medicine without a license under Rojas, who operated three clinics in the Houston area, according to Paxton’s office. Paxton, a Republican who is now running for Senate, called the individuals “a cabal of abortion-loving radicals” and “fake doctors” in a press release. “Those responsible will be held accountable,” he said. “I will always protect innocent life and use every tool to enforce Texas’s pro-life laws.” The Center for Reproductive Rights, which has represented Rojas in court, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. But in court documents, lawyers for Rojas have said that Texas has not proved that Rojas performed abortions, nor that she operated outside the scope of her midwifery license. Texas law enforcement, the lawyers argued, “jumped to wild conclusions after overseeing a slipshod investigation”. The lawyers for Rojas argued that Texas prosecutors relied too heavily on Rojas’s possession of the drug misoprostol as proof that she performed abortions. While misoprostol can be used to end pregnancies, it is also used for an array of other reasons, such as helping to soften a cervix before labor. “A licensed midwife’s possession of misoprostol is evidence of a midwifery practice, not abortion,” the lawyers argued in court. “If possessing misoprostol were evidence of abortion, then every hospital’s labor-and-delivery ward would be accused of providing abortions.” In the three years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, unleashing a wave of state-level abortion bans, anti-abortion activists have escalated their attacks on abortion providers. Louisiana has issued warrants for doctors in New York and California who are accused of mailing abortion pills across state lines, while several individuals – including men whose partners had abortions – have sued abortion providers. Paxton has emerged as a frontline leader in the fight against abortion providers. Late last year, he sued a New York doctor over accusations she provided abortion pills to a Texas woman. He has since sued a New York county clerk who refused to enforce a fine against the doctor, setting up a high-stakes battle over a New York law meant to protect providers from out-of-state prosecutions. In court, lawyers for Rojas have said that her clinics offered standard midwifery care, including telemedicine. In court documents filed in Rojas’s case in June, Texas prosecutors accused two of the people recently arrested of working as unlicensed “medical assistants”. Prosecutors cited a witness who said that one of the assistants, Jose Manuel Cendan Ley – who admitted to “triaging patients” – gave her a “vitamin infusion and iron injection”. The other assistant, Sabiel Bosch Gongora, had apps on his phone “used by medical professionals for clinical decision support, including drug interactions, medical guidelines, and disease diagnosis tools”, prosecutors said. Rojas’s lawyers argued in a September court briefing that prosecutors failed to prove that Ley and Gongora were independently diagnosing and treating patients.

"abortion","Women and men diverge more than ever on support for abortion rights, poll shows","Three years after the fall of Roe v Wade and months after an election that heavily focused on the fight over abortion rights, men and women have never diverged more on their support for access to the procedure, according to new polling from Gallup released Monday. Sixty-one percent of women now identify as “pro-choice”, but only 41% of men say the same, Gallup found. The same percentage of women identified as “pro-choice” in 2022, just after the decision to overturn Roe was leaked, but at the time, 48% of men also did so. Prior to Roe’s collapse, men and women were never more than 10 points apart from one another on the issue, according to decades of Gallup polling. Men and women are also in record disagreement over whether abortion is moral, as 57% of women and 40% men say that it is. Just 41% of men say that abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, while 56% of women say the same. These gender gaps are likely less due to post-Roe changes in men’s attitudes towards abortion than in changes in women’s attitudes, said Lydia Saad, Gallup’s director of US social research. Specifically: women have become a lot more supportive of abortion since Roe fell. In 2021, 52% of women and 45% of men identified as “pro-choice”. “In general, we see that with abortion, that the party that wants to change the status quo is the one that has more energy on the issue,” Saad said. “For years, it was more the pro-life respondents who said that they will only support a candidate who shares their views on that issue. Whereas, since 2022, we’ve seen it flip.” Sudden political upsets do have the power to dramatically change people’s beliefs, Saad said. Typically, however, those changes don’t last and people revert to their norm views within a few years. Men’s declining support for abortion may thus be a sign that they are reverting to their norm – but Saad was surprised women are still so energized by the issue. “A line had been crossed for women,” Saad said. “If you were generally supportive of abortion rights before, you became much more so.” Similarly, men who identify as Democrats have, like women, become much more likely to back abortion rights. Between 2020 and 2021, 63% of Democratic men said that they believed abortion should be legal in most circumstances; as of 2025, 78% of Democratic men say the same. Saad is not exactly sure why support for abortion rights is dwindling among men. Although this is the lowest level of support among men for the “pro-choice” label in a decade, she is not convinced that this decline will continue. “It’s more just a out of sight, out of mind issue for men,” Saad said of abortion’s legality. “Whereas for women – it’s just been more salient.” At this point, it’s difficult to tell whether men are becoming more actively opposed to abortion or whether they are simply becoming more conservative overall, Saad said. Men are already more likely to be Republicans, and Republicans typically oppose abortion rights. A mere 19% of Republican men think abortion should be legal in most circumstances. Saad suspects Gallup’s findings may be tied to shifts in the political views of young men, who proved to be surprisingly conservative in the 2024 election. Fifty-six percent of men between the ages of 18 and 29 voted for Donald Trump. “We have to see where this goes,” Saad cautioned. “If it’s sustained, then we would really have to take a close look at why.”","2025-06-09T20:02:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/women-men-abortion-rights-poll"
"abortion","Anti-abortion campaigner convicted of breaching buffer zone outside UK clinic","An activist whose case had been cited by the US state department over “freedom of expression” concerns in the UK has been convicted of breaching a buffer zone outside an abortion clinic. Livia Tossici-Bolt, an anti-abortion campaigner, went on trial at Poole magistrates court last month accused of breaching a public spaces protection order on two days in March 2023 near to a clinic in Bournemouth. On Friday she was found guilty of two charges of breaching the order. Tossici-Bolt was given a conditional discharge and ordered not to commit any additional offences over a two-year period. She was ordered to pay costs of £20,000 towards what the judge said had been the “considerable” resources expended by the local authority, along with £26 towards a victim surcharge fee. A delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, met Tossici-Bolt last month during a visit to the UK, along with a US-backed anti-abortion group, which had been supporting her case. In a post on X hours after the conviction on Friday, the DRL said: “We are disappointed with the UK court’s conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated ‘buffer zone’ at an abortion clinic. Freedom of expression must be protected for all.” Judge Orla Austin said it was beyond reasonable doubt that Tossici-Bolt was engaging in an act of disapproval of abortion services on the days in question. “She lacks insight that her presence could have a detrimental effect on the women attending the clinic, their associates, staff and members of the public,” the judge said. Tossici-Bolt had stood with a sign reading “Here to talk, if you want” facing the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic, which was previously targeted by anti-abortion activists who had gathered nearby before Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council put the order in place. A Downing Street spokesperson said it was vital that women using abortion services could do so “without being subject to harassment or distress” and that the right to protest did not “give people the right to harass others”. Asked whether there was a problem with free speech in the UK, the spokesperson said Britain had a “very proud tradition of free speech over many centuries, and we remain proud of it today”. The court previously heard evidence from council enforcement officers who said they had asked Tossici-Bolt to leave the area on both days after they received calls from a member of the public and from staff inside the clinic. Tossici-Bolt told one of the officers that she had located herself outside the clinic “because from my experience women come here in a very lonely state”. The order prohibited protests and other direct or indirect activities that could influence users of the abortion clinic and was in place on weekdays until 7pm. She had been asked to leave the area within that period. Austin said Tossici-Bolt could have gone somewhere else given that people who were lonely could be found everywhere. “I accept her beliefs were truly held beliefs. Although it’s accepted this defendant held [anti-abortion] views, it’s important to note this case is not about the rights and wrongs about abortion but about whether the defendant was in breach of the PSPO (public spaces protection order),” she said. The verdict was welcomed by the BPAS, which said the result would protect women and the staff who provided abortion care. The chief executive of BPAS, Heidi Stewart, said: “The clinic in Bournemouth has been subjected to decades of anti-abortion protests which resulted in more than 500 reports of harassment before this local safe access zone was brought into force. “This case was never about global politics but about the simple ability of women to access legal healthcare free from harassment.” During a discussion of costs, the hearing was told that Tossici-Bolt had significant assets and received a grant from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a registered charity in the UK, backed by a conservative US organisation of the same name. Kuljit Bhogal KC, for the council, said ADF UK had an income of more than £1.3m in the year up to June 2024 and that at least one member of staff had a salary of more than £100,000, according to records filed at Companies House. The Guardian reported on Wednesday on those filings on how the ADF has been expanding UK operations. Its global subsidiary, ADF International, said it is supporting Tossici-Bolt as she assesses her options in terms of an appeal. Robert Clarke, director of advocacy for ADF International, described the verdict as an “egregious failure of justice”.","2025-04-04T22:15:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/04/abortion-campaigner-livia-tossici-bolt-buffer-zone-clinic"
"abortion","Call to allow ‘safe and effective’ at-home abortions up to 12 weeks in UK","At-home abortions should be allowed for up to 12 weeks of pregnancy across the UK, according to academics, after a study found they were just as safe and effective as hospital care. A medical abortion involves taking two medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, to end a pregnancy. In 2022, at-home medical abortions were made permanent in England and Wales, after temporary legislation allowed them to take place at home during the pandemic. In Northern Ireland, at-home abortion care is not permitted at any gestation. Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommending that early medical abortions can occur safely at home in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, legislation across England and Wales limits this to 10 weeks. The study, published in BMJ Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health, looked at the outcomes of abortions carried out between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy in hospital and at home across NHS Lothian in Scotland, between 2020 and 2025. At-home medical abortions are legal in Scotland up to 12 weeks. During this period, 14,458 referrals were made to the abortion service, and of these 485 women (3.5%) were assessed as being between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy either by the date of their last period or by an ultrasound scan. The researchers found that 97% of abortions were successful for both groups of women. They also found cases of serious complications, such as heavy bleeding or infection, one month after the procedure among those who had opted for a medical abortion at home. But despite this, the researchers concluded it was a rare complication among women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant. “Our study contained a small number of patients, with only one case of haemorrhage that presented one month following abortion with chronic bleeding, and so admission to hospital for [early medical abortion] is unlikely to have altered this,” they said. The researchers concluded that the study showed that at-home medical abortions between 10 and 12 weeks were “highly effective and safe”. “In line with WHO guidance, action is needed to extend [early medical abortion] at home up to [12] weeks to women across the rest of the UK and beyond,” they concluded. Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “This important study from Scotland adds to the already extensive body of evidence that at-home medical abortion between 10 and [12] weeks’ gestation is safe and effective. “Thousands of women each year in the UK are being compelled to attend hospital appointments and undergo surgical procedures when, as this research makes clear, they could be treated at home.” She added: “When the abortion law was first passed in 1967, it was designed to protect and improve women’s health. Nearly 60 years later, this legislation is restricting our ability to innovate and develop services in line with clinical practice. “It is time for parliament to modernise our out-of-date legal framework, and finally allow healthcare professionals to give all women in the UK the best possible care, including the choice of an at-home medical abortion care throughout the first trimester.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.","2025-10-02T22:30:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/call-allow-safe-effective-home-abortions-12-weeks-uk"
"abortion","UK woman accused of using pills for illegal abortion during Covid lockdown","A woman has gone on trial in London accused of illegally taking pills in order to induce an abortion during the second coronavirus lockdown. Nicola Packer, 44, was arrested in November 2020 after she went to hospital having miscarried a foetus, and later reported to staff that she had taken abortion medication. She had been sent the drugs by a registered provider, MSI, referred to in court as Marie Stopes, after a telephone consultation with a nurse on 4 November, Isleworth crown court heard. “At about 3pm on Saturday, November 7, 2020, the defendant Nicola Packer, then aged 41, attended the Chelsea and Westminster hospital,” the prosecutor Alexandra Felix KC told the court. “She reported to a nurse that she was 16 to 18 weeks pregnant but ‘thought she had miscarried’. “Miss Packer went on to say that she had found out about the pregnancy on previous Monday, 2 November, but had started bleeding heavily and passed the foetus and some blood clots which she had brought with her to the hospital in a rucksack. “An obstetrician, a medical doctor, examined the foetus and estimated her, because it was female, to be 22 weeks gestation.” Under English law, medical abortion without attending a clinic in person is available up to nine weeks and six days of pregnancy, with the pills dispatched by post after a remote consultation. Early medical abortion was introduced as an emergency measure during Covid, with MPs later voting in 2022 to make the provisions permanent. Under the Abortion Act 1967, a termination is available up to 23 weeks and six days of pregnancy if certain criteria are met, and beyond the usual time limit in some circumstances, such as evidence of severe foetal anomaly or a significant risk to the mother’s life. “This trial is not about the defendant’s right to have an abortion; nor is it about why she chose to have an abortion, which was entirely a matter for her,” Felix told the court. “It is the prosecution case that the defendant is guilty of intentionally procuring an unlawful abortion because she was in excess of 24 weeks pregnant and she knew that the gestation of the foetus exceeded 10 weeks at the time she took the medication.” The court heard that Packer had a previous diagnosis of endometriosis, which she had undergone treatment for in the past, and had been prescribed a progesterone-only contraceptive pill to help manage her symptoms. In a conversation with a call handler from MSI she said she had last had a period that began on about 21 September, and when asked whether it had been lighter than usual, had said “they’ve all been fairly light recently”, the court heard. She said she had not been taking hormonal contraception during the last three months, as she had run out during the last lockdown and decided to take a break. Following the consultation, she was told she would be sent pills for an early medical abortion at home. Opening the case against Packer, Felix said police had obtained phone searches from around the time she took the pills, which included “difference between miscarriage and abortion” and “can abortion pills work later in pregnancy?” “If Nicola Packer thought she was early in pregnancy, why was she concerned to know whether abortion pills work later in pregnancy?” Felix asked the court. She also highlighted searches from Packer on 6 November including “medical abortion from 10 weeks to 24 weeks”, “can abortion pill be detected in urine”, and “how long does a later stage miscarriage take”. Other searches on her phone around the same time into how long an abortion would take suggested she had not started bleeding, or delivered a foetus, Felix said. “All of these searches were all at a time when Nicola Packer could not have known what the foetus looked like nor its size,” Felix told the court. “Yet the searches suggest that she knows that the foetus she is carrying is more than 10 weeks old.” At 5.07am in the morning on 7 November, Packer had searched “if you late miscarry at home what do you do with the foetus”, Felix told the court, “which suggests that by now Nicola Packer had miscarried”. Packer called 111 several hours later to report that she had had a “late-stage miscarriage”, estimating the foetus to be about 18 weeks, but did not report that she had taken abortion medication. “The crown says that she gave at least a misleading account and indeed a dishonest one,” Felix told the court. Packer was advised to go to hospital, and did not initially disclose to medical staff that she had taken abortion medication. It was only after she was told by a senior midwife, Claire Baker, that “she was there to care for her, that her safety was their priority and that what whatever happened they were there to support her”, that Packer told staff she had taken medication supplied to her by MSI, the court heard. “She was advised that the police would be called and the coroner would have to be informed,” Felix said. “In this case, because she is likely to say that she honestly believed that she was less than 10 weeks gestation,” Felix told the court, “then it will be for the crown to prove that she did not honestly believe that she was less than 10 weeks pregnant”. The trial continues.","2025-04-24T15:25:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/24/uk-woman-accused-using-pills-abortion-covid-lockdown"
"abortion","How idea of charging women with murder infiltrated the anti-abortion movement","So far this year, lawmakers in at least 12 states have introduced legislation that would treat fetuses as people and leave women who have abortions vulnerable to being charged with homicide – a charge that, in several of these states, carries the death penalty. Once seen as politically toxic, this kind of legislation has become more popular in the years since Roe v Wade fell, erasing the national right to abortion. This likely comes as no surprise to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and one of the foremost commentators on the US abortion wars. The anti-abortion movement, she writes in her new book Personhood: The New Civil War Over Reproduction, has really “always been a fetal-personhood movement” – one that is so emboldened, it is increasingly unconcerned with public opinion or even democratic norms. Fetal personhood is the belief that embryos and fetuses deserve the legal rights and protections afforded to people. If taken to its logical conclusion in US law, this belief would not only totally outlaw abortion, but also risk pitting the rights of fetuses against the rights of the women carrying them in all kinds of circumstances. In the first year after the US supreme court overturned Roe, at least 200 people were prosecuted for conduct relating to their pregnancies. Most of these cases involved charges of child endangerment, abuse or neglect – language that treats fetuses as children. A Guggenheim fellow who has published seven books on reproduction and abortion, Ziegler has long seen the fight for fetal personhood as the throughline in the anti-abortion movement’s centuries-long history. In recent years, with Roe gone, she grew convinced that the movement was no longer willing to pull punches in that fight. “The trajectory has been more and more punitive, more focused on saying: ‘Justice for the fetus means punishing a larger group of people that encompasses not just doctors, but people who assist them, and potentially abortion seekers themselves,’” she said in an interview. Personhood, which was released Tuesday, argues that the anti-abortion movement did not have to be so punitive. While anti-abortion activists have never agreed on how to best implement fetal personhood, they over time started to take more cues from Republican politicians, whose own veneration of “law and order” grew alongside its antagonism toward a social safety net. Those developments ultimately paved the way for the more extreme anti-abortion activists to grab more power within the movement. After Roe legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, anti-abortion activists organized in support of an amendment to the US constitution that would recognize embryos and fetuses as people. (The effort never gained the political traction it needed to become a serious possibility.) Around the same time, some activists broke with mainstream anti-abortion groups to push for policies that would offer more support for pregnant women, rather than just ban abortion. Yet the voices advocating for better daycare and housing for mothers faded away as the anti-abortion movement tightened its alliance with the Republican party. Anti-abortion activists understood that, by portraying fetuses as defenseless victims of the ultimate crime, they could energize conservative voters – and open their pockets. “The Republican party, from the Reagan era onward, has really equated a kind of justice and equality with punishing wrongdoers,” Ziegler said. “It’s a natural fit for the anti-abortion movement: the more its fortunes relied on Republican politicians, the more it framed things the same way.” State-level bans on abortion still do not technically punish abortion patients. (Instead, it’s abortion providers, long positioned by the movement as coercing or confusing women into the procedure, and sometimes the people who help them, who are at risk of criminal consequences.) But, over the last few years, self-described “abortion abolitionists” have slowly migrated out of the fringes of the anti-abortion movement and moved towards its center. Unlike mainstream “pro-lifers”, “abolitionists” believe that, if a fetus is a person and abortion is the murder of that person, women should be punished accordingly: as murderers. Neither “pro-lifers” nor “abolitionists” are particularly popular. After Roe’s collapse enabled states to make their own abortion laws, several states – including GOP strongholds like Ohio and Missouri – passed ballot measures to protect abortion rights. According to Gallup, 85% of Americans think that abortion should be legal in all or some circumstances, while a 2024 survey from the 19th News and SurveyMonkey found that 41% of Americans think “a fetus has rights starting at conception that should be protected by the government.” Even people who support fetal personhood can have tangled, even contradictory views on the matter. Only 9% of people think that the government should restrict access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, even though IVF as it is currently practiced frequently involves the destruction or abandonment of embryos. None of the bills that allow abortion patients to be charged with homicide are likely to pass this year, but Ziegler doesn’t think “abolitionists” are going anywhere, for two reasons. First, the anti-abortion movement maintains a strong grip in southern Republican-dominated state legislatures, where many of these bills have emerged. Second, Ziegler believes that the anti-abortion movement is embracing “a conviction that it matters less what voters think and more what judges think”. “If you don’t worry about what you’re doing being unpopular, and you believe that ideological consistency, or even logical consistency, is paramount, you would be more inclined to go with an abolitionist argument, and you might worry less about that having political fallout in a politically uncompetitive state,” Ziegler said. “You don’t need to convince most Americans you’re right. You only need to convince five justices on the supreme court.” With abortion bans proving deeply unpopular in the US, circumventing popular will has become a necessity for an increasingly hardline movement. And by relying on the courts rather than voters, the anti-abortion movement can afford to ignore voters’ misgivings. The movement has abandoned its earlier goal of amending the US constitution to recognize fetal personhood; instead, the anti-abortion movement is now seeking to convince courts that the 14th amendment, which guarantees the right of due process and equal protection, already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people from the moment of conception. It is, according to Ziegler, yet another sign of the movement’s drift away from democratic norms. This interest in the 14th amendment is also something of an about-face for the anti-abortion movement, which is predominantly white and has had a convoluted relationship with race for more than a century. At the time that the amendment passed, as part of a post-civil war effort to recognize Black people’s rights, anti-abortion leaders “didn’t want to talk about race because they weren’t sure that people of color were persons with rights”, Ziegler said. Over time, the anti-abortion movement began using the language of civil rights and affirmative action – but primarily to argue that fetuses are the greatest victim of discrimination. “I think that’s one of the reasons fetal personhood language has been resonant for so long,” Ziegler said of the movement’s co-option of civil rights rhetoric. “It gives people a way to talk about equality and a way to elevate somebody as a victim of discrimination in a way that makes sense to a largely white group of conservatives.” As Roe recedes further into the rearview mirror, Ziegler expects the movement to become even more committed to some of the most unpopular implications of fetal personhood, such as restrictions on IVF. Although Republican politicians have shied away from limiting access to the treatment, the anti-abortion movement has grown more strident on the topic. Some of its leaders even condemned Donald Trump for his recent executive order supporting IVF. “I think the anti-abortion movement is going to be still full steam ahead,” Ziegler said. “There’s an increasing sentiment in the movement that this is not about pleasing Republicans. This is not about pleasing voters. This is about the importance of this, ideologically, to the people involved.”","2025-04-23T16:05:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/anti-abortion-fetal-personhood"
"abortion","Key court hearing as Alabama threatens prosecutions over abortion support","A bellwether test of states’ ability to prosecute people over abortions that take place across state lines faces a critical hearing on Wednesday, when Alabama abortion rights supporters square off against the state attorney general over his threats to prosecute groups that help women travel for the procedure. In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, clearing the way for Alabama to ban virtually all abortions, Alabama attorney general Steve Marshall repeatedly suggested that abortion rights activists who help people go out of state for abortions could be charged as participants in an illegal conspiracy. The Yellowhammer Fund, an abortion fund that helped people pay for the procedure, and the West Alabama Women’s Center, a former abortion clinic that pivoted to providing services like miscarriage management, joined with other abortion rights advocates to sue Marshall over his comments. Now, experts worry that a victory for Alabama could serve as a green light for other states’ efforts to attack people who want to end their pregnancies but live in states that ban abortion. “If you go to Las Vegas to gamble, but your state doesn’t permit it, you don’t expect for your AG to suggest that anybody who helped you gamble in another state is going to be prosecuted, fined, and jailed,” said Rachel Rebouché, an expert in reproductive health law and the dean of Temple University’s law school. “It’s a real encroachment on what we take for granted about how states treat each other – but also within the state, that the state will turn its law enforcement power against somebody who has done something that is not illegal.” Since Marshall’s threats, the Yellowhammer Fund has stopped paying for people’s legal, out-of-state abortions, while the West Alabama Women’s Center is unable to help patients looking for out-of-state abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs in the case collectively receive about 95 questions each week from people looking for abortions outside Alabama. “The majority of our clients’ patients are poor or low income. They are people who may depend on financial assistance and support in figuring out how to get the resources they need to pay for travel,” said Meagan Burrows, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, which is representing West Alabama Women’s Center (now known as WAWC Healthcare). “All of these patients are coming to our clients very distressed, very confused about the legal landscape and their legal options, and are rightly contacting local healthcare providers in Alabama that they trust, who they know have all of the information and resources at their fingertips by virtue of being providers of reproductive healthcare, and former abortion care providers. And our clients have to turn them away.” The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in court filings, it doubled down on Marshall’s claims. “An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the state to have that same act performed outside the state is illegal,” one brief read. The hearing on Wednesday, in federal court in Montgomery, will deal with requests from both sides for summary judgment, or to move forward without a full trial. Despite the downfall of Roe, which unleashed a wave of abortion bans across much of the US south and midwest, US abortions have increased in recent years. That rise, abortion rights supporters say, is due in large part to travel, as abortion clinics on the coasts have performed a growing number of procedures on women fleeing states with bans. In response, anti-abortion activists have begun to test out various ways to attack out-of-state abortion travel, including by limiting talk of it. In Texas, an activist has drawn abortion funds, which help people travel out of state for abortions, into litigation and asked them to turn over information about past abortions. Idaho and Tennessee have passed laws that ban “abortion trafficking” – which they define as transporting a minor for an abortion without parental consent – as well as “recruiting” minors for abortions. A court has blocked the “recruiting” provision in Idaho’s law, citing first amendment concerns, while another court has paused the enforcement of Tennessee’s entire law. “With criminal penalties for helpers, penalties for providers, what you see are anti-[abortion] rights politicians attempting to stop anyone who is helping a pregnant person or pregnant people from seeking care,” Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy and advocacy for the Center for Reproductive Rights, told the Guardian last year. “The pregnant person, essentially, would be isolated and unable to seek the care that they want and need.” Abortions have also risen thanks to the emergence of blue-state “shield laws”, which aim to protect providers who dispense medication abortion pills across state lines. Abortion opponents have, in recent weeks, targeted those providers, too. Louisiana has indicted a New York doctor for allegedly dispensing an abortion pill, while Texas has filed a lawsuit against the same doctor. Mary Ziegler, who studies the legal history of reproduction, sees all of these efforts as intertwined. “It’s part of a broader set of issues about when states can project their power across their borders,” Ziegler said. Regardless of the outcome of Wednesday’s hearing, red states appear to already be on a warpath. “Attorneys general are just going full speed ahead, even when it comes to out-of-state defendants,” said Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. “I think the gloves came off after the election was over.” A ruling in the requests for summary judgment is expected in the coming weeks.","2025-03-05T11:00:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion"
"abortion","MPs back bill to end criminal penalties for abortion in key vote – as it happened","Government officials have admitted they made a mistake by making the financial case for cutting benefits as they steel themselves for as many as 50 Labour MPs rebelling against the welfare bill that is being published on Wednesday, writes Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot. Sources told the Guardian that they now believed the party should have focused on the moral case for reforming the welfare system, arguing that it was letting down millions of people who could be supported into work. Labour insiders believe they could have kept more MPs on side if they had not highlighted the £5bn savings the Treasury would make as a result of the cuts to health and disability benefits that have so angered the party. At the time of the spring statement, ministers said there were two justifications for the move: one was to get people off benefits in the long term, but the justification for the immediate cut to incapacity benefit was to make sure the system remained financially sustainable. British MPs have voted to decriminalise abortion, marking the biggest step forward in reproductive rights in almost 60 years. In an amendment to the government’s crime and policing bill, parliament voted to change the criminal laws that govern abortion in England and Wales so that women procuring their own termination outside the legal framework cannot be prosecuted. The framework of access to an abortion – including the need for two doctors’ signatures, and the time limits at which terminations can be carried out – will remain the same and doctors who act outside the law will still face the threat of prosecution. But women who terminate their own pregnancy outside the rules, for example after the time limit or by buying pills online, will no longer face arrest or prison. The offence of inducing a miscarriage carries a maximum sentence of life. The amendment, put forward by the Labour backbencher Tonia Antoniazzi, passed in a free vote of MPs after growing calls for a change in the law as the number of women investigated, arrested or prosecuted has increased in recent years. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch voted against Tonia Antoniazzi’s new clause one, to decriminalise abortion for women in relation to their own pregnancies. According to Commons data, she was joined in the “no” lobby by her shadow cabinet colleagues Sir Mel Stride, Richard Fuller, Dame Priti Patel, Chris Philp, Alex Burghart, James Cartlidge, Kevin Hollinrake, Helen Whately, Andrew Griffith, Robert Jenrick, Edward Argar, Stuart Andrew, Gareth Bacon, Alan Mak, Mims Davies, Andrew Bowie, and Jesse Norman. Shadow education secretary Laura Trott voted in favour of the proposed new clause. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said the vote by MPs to decriminalise abortion is a “landmark moment for women’s rights”. Chief executive Heidi Stewart said: “This is a landmark moment for women’s rights in this country and the most significant change to our abortion law since the 1967 Abortion Act was passed. “There will be no more women investigated after enduring a miscarriage, no more women dragged from their hospital beds to the back of a police van, no more women separated from their children because of our archaic abortion law. “This is a hard won victory, and we thank all those who have campaigned alongside us, and in particular those women, like Nicola Packer, who have spoken out about their traumatic experiences in the hope of achieving the change parliament has delivered today. “When we launched the campaign to decriminalise abortion in 2016, we could not have envisaged that within a decade such progress would be achieved. “In the past six years, we have seen more progressive reform of abortion law than we had seen in the previous 50. “Today’s vote is testament to the strength of support for abortion rights across the healthcare sector, civil society, parliament, and the country as a whole. “We look forward to continuing to work with MPs to deliver wider reform and an abortion framework fit for the 21st century.” Commons data shows which way each MP voted on decriminalising abortion for women in relation to their own pregnancy. Cabinet members backing Tonia Antoniazzi’s proposed new clause one when MPs headed for the voting lobbies included: Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, Defence Secretary John Healey, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Steve Reed, Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn, Scotland Secretary Ian Murray, Wales Secretary Jo Stevens, and Commons Leader Lucy Powell. Tory MP Jerome Mayhew told MPs: “We have to acknowledge we have made a major change to abortion law, [without] no evidence session or committee stage scrutiny. Just 46 minutes of backbench debate.” Reacting to the result, Humanists UK’s public affairs manager, Karen Wright, said: “Thanks to every MP who voted in support changing the law to end the horror of women facing police investigations when at their most vulnerable. “MPs today have made history in shaping a more humane law that prioritises treating women with compassion instead of suspicion in their hour of need.” And that brings the vote to an end. The ayes voted 117, the noes 379, giving a majority of 262. MPs have now divided to vote on new clause 106 to the crime and policing bill. Dr Caroline Johnson tabled the amendment that would require a pregnant woman to have an in-person consultation before lawfully being prescribed medicine for the termination of a pregnancy. The result is expected at 7.30pm. The ayes voted 379, the noes 137, giving a majority of 242. MPs have divided to vote on new clause 1 to the crime and policing bill. NC1 disapplies existing criminal law related to abortion from women acting in relation to their own pregnancy at any gestation. Here is the text of The Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi’s amendment. To move the following clause — “Removal of women from the criminal law related to abortion For the purposes of the law related to abortion, including sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, no offence is committed by a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy.” Here is more from the father of the house, Sir Edward Leigh. He said Creasy’s amendment new clause 20 “would fully repeal all the existing laws that prohibit abortion in any circumstances at any gestation both in relation to a woman undergoing an abortion, and abortion providers or clinicians performing abortions”. Referring to Antoniazzi’s new clause one, he told MPs it would “not be illegal for a woman to carry out her own abortion at home solely on the basis that the foetus is female” and added: “So, these amendments are not pro-woman. They would introduce sex-selective abortion.” Leigh told the Commons: “In conclusion, what we are faced (with) here is an extreme set of amendments going way beyond what public dominion demands or way beyond what is happening in any other country in the world.” Earlier, intervening during Leigh’s speech, Reform UK MP, Sarah Pochin, said: “Due to medical advancements, we can save the life of a foetus at 21 weeks, yet we can legally terminate a foetus at 24 weeks. “I shall be voting against all the amendments to decriminalisation of abortion and in fact, would (Sir Edward) not agree with me that we should actually be reducing the window in which you can have an abortion so that the law reflects the realities of modern medicine?” Decriminalising abortion risks making the 24-week time limit “meaningless”, Conservative MP Rebecca Smith said. The South West Devon MP told the Commons: “Many supporters of new clause one and new clause 20 claim that the 24-week time limit for abortions would not change, but in my view this is misleading. “Any time limit is meaningless if abortions are legalised all the way up to birth for any reason without a legal deterrent. Once decriminalisation takes place, it is my concern that further steps will be taken to expand abortion time limits.” Intervening, Labour MP for Gower Tonia Antoniazzi said: “We are not here to amend the Abortion Act. This is not a backbench business debate. “We are here to lay an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill. I hope she stands corrected.” Smith replied that she feared “a bit of a slippery slope”, and that she and Antoniazzi “may just have to disagree on that”. DUP MP Carla Lockhart has insisted that “both lives matter”, saying the proposed amendments “would be bad for both women and unborn children”. Conservative MP and Father of the House Sir Edward Leigh, speaking against both amendments, described them as “not pro-woman” and argued they “would introduce sex-selective abortion”. Here is more from Labour MP Stella Creasy, who proposed another amendment on abortion that would decriminalise it. Creasy said: “I think we all agree that there is a concern about vulnerable people and abortion law in this country. We disagree about how to address those concerns.” She said abortion laws were under attack in the UK and around the world. Creasy added: “If we think that the reason why we face these challenges are that we have these outdated laws in this country, then why would we retain them in any shape or form, rather than learning from what is best practice around the world for all of our constituents.” She continued: “I hear very strongly the stories about the investigations and prosecutions, and want to see change, but I also recognise that change does not come without consequences. New clause 20, therefore, is about what many of us who have worked on what is good abortion law is based on. “It is based on what, frankly, the sector itself used to say mattered, which was that abortion law in England and Wales should recognise developments in modern abortion law in Northern Ireland, delivering on the promise that we made in this place in 2019 that abortion was a human right, that safe care was a human right for women, and that we should see a progression of minimum human rights standards on abortion.” Tory MP Rebecca Paul said the criminalisation of abortion is not the problem but the “pills by post scheme is”, in reference to cases of women ordering abortion pills to be taken at home after 20 weeks without sufficient checks. Labour MP Lizzi Collinge tells MPs that 88% of abortions happen before nine weeks. She added that abortions made at 20 weeks make up of 0.1% cases. Collinge said NC1 will protect women from “brutal investigations” which she adds are “intrusive”. This is how Stella Creasy summed up the case for her NC20 amendment. If we think that the reason why we face these challenges are that we have these outdated laws in this country, then why would we retain them in any shape or form, rather than learning from what is best practice around the world for all of our constituents.” I hear very strongly the stories about the investigations and prosecutions, and want to see change, but I also recognise that change does not come without consequences. New clause 20, therefore, is about what many of us who have worked on what is good abortion law is based on. It is based on what, frankly, the sector itself used to say mattered, which was that abortion law in England and Wales should recognise developments in modern abortion law in Northern Ireland, delivering on the promise that we made in this place in 2019 that abortion was a human right, that safe care was a human right for women, and that we should see a progression of minimum human rights standards on abortion. That is all from me for today. Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. Turning away from the abortion debate for a moment, Keir Starmer has told Sky News in an interview what he thinks his biggest mistake has been since becoming prime minister. He said: I think that we haven’t always told our story as well as we should, explained our decisions in the way that might, in retrospect, have been better. But that’s the nature of politics. Creasy says she will support NC1 – even though if it is passed it will knock out her amendment. But she says her amendment – that is more complicated NC1, because it rewrites and modernises abortion law – would be better. Under her NC20, abortion would decriminalised up to 24 weeks, negating elements of the Abortion Act. It would also ensure that late-term abortions outside the Abortion Act did not result in prison sentences. She says MPs will only be able get one abortion law over the line. They should back her plan, which would make the biggest difference to constituents, she says. Creasy says the current laws have criminalised people who have had stillbirths. They need compassion, not prosecution, she says. Desmond Swayne (Con) says there are two lives involved in a decision about abortion. Creasy says the life of the foetus depends on the health of the mother. So if we don’t protect women, we won’t have babies either, she says. John Hayes (Con) says when the 1967 abortion law was passed, David Steel, the Liberal MP who introduced the bill, said he did not want to see abortion on request. But Creasy described abortion as a right, he says. He asks how Creasy can reconcil those two positons. Creasy says she does not think Steel would want women to be put at risk if they need an abortion. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP who tabled the main alternative amendment (see 5.05pm), is speaking now. She says her new clause 20 (NC20) is based on best practice in abortion law elsehwere. She says only her clause is decriminalisation. It would remove abortion from the criminal law, protecting clinicians (who are not protected by Antoniazzi’s NC1) as well as pregnant women. Dr Caroline Johnson, a Conservative, is speaking now. She has tabled her own amendment, new clause 106, that would require a pregnant woman to have an in-person consultation before lawfully being prescribed medicine for the termination of a pregnancy. She started her speech by saying she was concerned about Antoniazzi’s amendment. She is a paediatrician, and she said she supported women’s right to choose in the early stage of pregnancy. But she said she did not support termination later in a pregnancy, and she said Antoniazzi had not denied that, under her amendment, a woman could get an abortion near late term. UPDATE: Defending her amendment, Johnson said: I’m not trying to limit people’s access to what is clinically legally available. I’m trying to make sure that people are safe when they do so. I’m thinking about women who have been trafficked, women who are being forced into sex work, we talked yesterday in the house about women, young girls, who have been groomed and raped in the grooming gang scandal. Would we put it past those evil, nasty men to have got drugs … and given them to these young girls, to hide the evidence of their crime? I would not put it past them. What about those who want to conserve the honour of their family? What about those who think that the baby that’s being carried by their partner is of the wrong gender because they would like it to be a boy and they’re having a girl? What about those who are trying to cover up sexual abuse, particularly teenagers and young girls, by hiding evidence of their crimes and causing termination? Antoniazzi says her amendment has public support. And she says it has the backing of every abortion provider and every organisation that represents abortion providers in England and Wales, royal colleges, GPs psychiatrists, nurses and groups campaigning to end violence against women and girls. The public overwhelmingly support this change as well. I implore colleagues not to lose sight of the moral imperative here, namely vulnerable women being dragged from a hospital bed to (a) police cell on suspicion of ending their own pregnancies. This is urgent. We know multiple women are still in a system awaiting a decision, accused of breaking this law. They cannot afford to wait. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put an end to this in a simple and secure manner. This is the right change at the right time. I implore colleagues who want to protect women and girls and abortion services to vote for new clause one. Let’s ensure that not a single desperate woman ever again is subject to traumatic, criminal investigation at the worst moments in their lives. There must be no more Lauras, and there must be no more Nicola Packers. Angus MacDonald (Lib Dem) asks Antoniazzi thinks a woman who tried to end a pregnancy near full term should still be covered by the protection in this amendment. Antoniazzi says she cannot imagine a woman doing that if she were not subject to coercion. And she asks how a woman would terminate a pregnancy in those circumtances. If they took pills, they would still give birth, she says. Toby Perkins (Lab) says he is concerned about the amendment because it would mean there could be no circumstances at all in which a woman might be prosecuted for terminating a pregnancy. He asks: “Could she say anything to explain why there must never be any prosecution ever?” Antoniazzi says she does not accept the existing law is a deterrent at all. There is no woman that is deterred, or anybody that is deterred, this is not a deterrent. The criminal law does not work as a deterrent. These women are desperate. These women need help. They may be coerced, they may be in a situation where it could be just a stillbirth, it could be, but that isn’t going to help the woman at any point. After Sam Rushworth (Lab) raises a similar concerns, Antoniazzi says she does not believe any woman has an abortion lightly. I don’t know of any woman who has had an abortion, at any stage, takes it lightly. Any abortion, at any stage of your pregnancy, is a life-changing experience. That’s why I do not take this lightly. That is why, whether it is six weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, whatever, whether it’s in term, out of term, that experience of child loss, whether it is planned or not, stays with a woman for the rest of her life. Antoniazzi mentions Stella Creasy’s rival amendment, NC20 or new clause 20, and she says Creasy was being targeted by protesters outside the House of Commons today, who had a banner with a large picture of Creasy making her easy to identify when she was arriving for work. Antoniazzi says no MP should have to endure harassment like that. Antoniazzi cites other examples of women prosecuted for abortion offences. She goes on: Each one of these cases is a travesty enabled by our outdated abortion law. Although abortion is available in England and Wales under conditions set by the 1967 Abortion Act, the law underpinning it dating back to 1861, the Offences against the Person Act, means that outside those conditions, it remains a criminal offence carrying a maximum life sentence. Originally passed by an all-male parliament elected by men alone, this Victorian law is increasingly used against vulnerable women and girls. Since 2020 more than 100 women have been criminally investigated … Women affected are often acutely vulnerable victims of domestic abuse and violence, human trafficking and sexual exploitation, girls under the age of 18 and women who have suffered miscarriage. Antoniazzi started her speech by telling the story of Nicola Packer. Antoniazzi said: Nearly five years ago, having suffered a rare complication in her abortion treatment, Nicola Packer lay down in shock having just delivered a foetus at home. Later arriving at hospital, bleeding and utterly traumatised, she had no idea that her ordeal was about to get the worse. Her life torn apart, recovering from surgery, Nicola was taken from a hospital bed by uniformed police officers in a police van and arrested for illegal abortion offences. In custody, her computers and phone were seized, and she was denied timely access to vital anti clotting medication. What followed was a four and a half year pursuit by the police and the CPS, which completely overshadowed Nicola’s life, culminating in the being forced to endure the indignity and turmoil of a trial. She spent every penny she had funding her defence. The most private details of her life were publicly aired, and she had to relive the trauma in front of a jury. All of this to ultimately be cleared and found not guilty. Nicola’s story is deplorable, but there are many others. The abortion debate is starting. The Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi is opening the debate. That is because her amendment is the lead amendment, NC1 or new clause 1. It will be put to a vote at 7pm. Here is the text of her amendment. To move the following Clause — “Removal of women from the criminal law related to abortion For the purposes of the law related to abortion, including sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929, no offence is committed by a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy.” And here is Antoniazzi’s description of what this will do. This new clause would disapply existing criminal law related to abortion from women acting in relation to her own pregnancy at any gestation, removing the threat of investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment. It would not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, including but not limited to the time limit, telemedicine, the grounds for abortion, or the requirement for two doctors’ approval. Judith Cummins, the deputy Speaker, says that if NC1 is passed, then the rival decriminalisation amendment, from Labour’s Stella Creasy, will not be put to a vote because the two amendments are not consistent. In the Commons they are now on their fourth division on the crime and policing bill, pushing back the start of the abortion debate again. Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent, covering Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada. The UK will look into a more “transactional” approach to granting visas for countries which refuse to take back national who are refused asylum, Keir Starmer has said at the G7 summit in Canada. Asked during a media Q&amp;A about way to reduce the numbers of people arriving unofficially in small boats, the prime minister indicated that countries which refuse to cooperate with returns could then see their nationals find it harder to get UK visas. This would also be the case, he said, for countries which did not cooperate on efforts to prevent their nationals heading towards Europe and potentially the UK to claim asylum. Describing a G7 session on migration at the summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, on Monday, Starmer said: I also, at the session yesterday, made clear that we are looking at issues like a smarter use of our visas, looking at whether we should tie our visas to the work that the countries we’re dealing with are doing on preventative measures and on return agreements. The UK currently has returns deals with 11 nations including Albania, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Iraq, Nigeria and Bangladesh. A process whereby people refused asylum can be swiftly sent back is seen as a notable disincentive, with the number of Albanian nationals seeking asylum in the UK having dropped sharply. Starmer said: We’re looking at what we can do on returns agreements. We’ve done a number of bilateral returns agreements. So the question is, again, whether it’s possible to go a bit beyond that. But we are including looking at this question of visas now, and whether we can’t be a bit smarter with the use of our visas in return in relation to countries that don’t have a returns agreement with us. This would be, he added, “much more sort of transactional” in approach. More widely, Starmer said, he had spoken at length at the summit with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Georgia Meloni, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, about asylum and small boats. He said: It was a central part of my discussion, certainly with France, with Germany and with Italy in the bilaterals that we had. I think we need to strengthen our existing tools, but then go further and see what else we can do. And that is a piece of work we’re looking at with the French in particular. So we’ll see where that gets to. At the joint session on migration, Starmer said, he “put out a series of proposals on what we should be doing in terms of counter-terrorism, powers, sanctions and the way that we are able to work together on that and returns agreements”. He added: I obviously raised it specifically, and indeed in detail, with President Macron, and in terms of the specific actions that I want us to take together, as I did with Georgia Meloni, slightly more upstream with her, which is where she’s shown some success in reducing her own numbers, and with Friedrich Mertz as well, because some of the boats are transiting through Germany. Another division has just been called in the Commons, which means the abortion debate will not start for at least another 15 minutes. Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent, covering Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada. Keir Starmer said he rushed to pick up papers dropped by Donald Trump at the G7 summit in Canada mainly to avoid anyone else stepping forward to do so and being tackled by the president’s security team. Speaking to reporters in Kananaskis a day after Trump fumbled some of the documents about a UK-US trade deal, with a sheaf of papers tumbling to the ground, Starmer said he had little choice but to bend down and help out. I mean, look, there weren’t many choices with the documents and picking it up, because one – as you probably know there were quite strict rules about who can get close to the president. I mean, seriously, I think if any of you [the media] had stepped forward other than me, I was just deeply conscious that in a situation like it would not have been good for anybody else to have stepped forward – not that any of you rushed to. There’s a very tightly guarded security zone around the president, as you would expect. As well as dropping the papers, Trump wrongly announced that he had agreed a deal with the European Union, not the UK, and some of his answers were unclear and rambling. Asked if he had any concerns about Trump’s health, Starmer rejected this: No, he was in good form yesterday, and I mean we had – I don’t know how many sessions yesterday together as the G7 and then into the evening session as well. As Starmer and Trump spoke to the media on Monday before their private talks, the US president was again effusive in his praise for the prime minister. Asked why Trump liked him so much, Starmer replied: I mean, that’s really for him to answer me, but I think it’s that we do have a good relationship. I think that is in the national interest. Frankly, there has long been a close relationship between the US and the UK, as I’ve said many times, on defence and security and intelligence-sharing in particular. I’m very pleased that I’ve got a good relationship with him, notwithstanding, as both he and I acknowledge, that our political backgrounds are different. Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent, covering Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada. Keir Starmer has hit out at Kemi Badenoch and other Conservatives for politicising the issue of grooming gangs after having, as he put it, done almost nothing about the issue when in power. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Starmer was critical in particular of Badenoch, the Conservative leader, and Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary. Referencing his claim that some politicians had jumped on a “far-right bandwagon” on the issue, Starmer said this involved “calling out politicians – nobody else – who in power had said and done nothing, who are now making the claims that they make”. Asked if Badenoch was weaponising grooming gangs, Starmer called on people to “just compare and contrast” his record prosecuting gangs as director of public prosecutions, and his call for mandatory reporting of such offences, and the record of the Tory leader. Kemi Badenoch, if I remember rightly, was the minister for children and for women, and I think the record will show that she didn’t raise the question of grooming once when she was in power, not once. Not one word from the dispatch box on any of this. Chris Philp, I think, went to 300-plus meetings when he was in his position in the Home Office, and at not one of those meetings did he raise the question of grooming. The question for Kemi Badenoch is, you were in power, you had all the tools at your disposal, I was calling even then from mandatory reporting, why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you say one word about it? In the Commons a second division has been called on the crime and policing bill, which will take about 15 minutes. Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent, covering Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada. MPs are going to have a free vote on decriminalising abortion, which is viewed as a conscience issue at Westminster, not a party political matter. But Keir Starmer has signalled that, if he were in London, he would be voting for reform. He told reporters: It is a conscience issue, therefore it is a free vote. And therefore in that sense, it’s in the same category as assisted dying. But my longstanding in principle position is that women have the right to a safe and legal abortion, and that’s been my longstanding position. In the Commons MPs are now voting on an amendment to the crime and policing bill. They have just finished the first part of today’s report stage debate, and when the voting is finished they will start the second stage of the debate, dealing with amendments relating to abortion. This will run until 7pm when the vote, or votes, will take place. Here is Hannah Al-Othman’s preview story. Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent, covering Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada. Keir Starmer has rejected the idea that Donald Trump might want to directly involve the US in helping Israel attack Iran, saying that his discussions with the US president at the G7 summit made him convinced Trump genuinely sought peace, pointing to Trump’s decision to also sign a leaders’ statement about the need for de-escalation. Speaking to reporters at the summit in Kananaskis, Canada, Starmer said he was sitting next to Trump at Monday evening’s leaders’ G7 dinner at which the statement was drafted, “so I’ve no doubt, in my mind, the level of agreement there was in relation to the words that were then issued immediately after that”. Asked if the US might help attack Iran, Starmer said: I don’t think anything that the president said either here or elsewhere suggests that. The wording of the G7 statement is very clear about de-escalation and de-escalation across the region, and obviously including the situation in Gaza for a ceasefire. So I think that the statement really speaks for itself in terms of the shared position of everybody who was here at the G7 and that was a statement that was agreed. Asked about Trump’s comments about not wanting a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Starmer said: I think what he said was he wanted to go beyond a ceasefire, effectively, and end the conflict. And I think he’s right about that. I mean, a ceasefire is always a means to an end. The end we want to see is the de-escalation and back to negotiations – a deal to deal with the Iranian nuclear program, and, of course, the wider question of conflict across the Middle East, including Gaza. Documents setting out in detail how Labour planned to deliver Keir Starmer’s five missions, published when the party was in oppositon, have been deleted from its website, “begging the question of whether they will join the online dashboard in being quietly shelved”, Luke O’Reilly says in a report for LabourList. O’Reilly says: The missions as they currently appear on Labour’s website consist of a list with a single line explaining what the mission involves. To take one example, the government’s NHS mission appears as: Build an NHS fit for the future that is there when people need it, where everyone lives well for longer. However, back in early 2024, detailed PDFs appeared alongside each mission on Labour’s opposition-era website … We asked Labour why the PDFs had been removed, but received no reply. Similarly, last November it was reported that the government would launch a public dashboard enabling voters to monitor its progress on hitting its milestones – which were based on the missions … However, the initiative appears to have been quietly shelved, with no explanation given as to what happened to it. More than 50 councils across the UK will receive a share of £1.2m to combat the scourge of chewing gum litter on the country’s high streets, the Department for Environment, Food And Rural Affairs has announced today. Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent. An independent Scotland is “within reach”, its achievement “the defining choice for this generation”, John Swinney has told an audience of public, private and third sector representatives at a conference in Edinburgh this lunchtime. The first minister told Scotland 2050, a one-day conference with the stated aim of envisaging Scotland’s long-term future: Independence is the defining choice for this generation, have no doubt. Because the UK status quo has proved itself incapable of delivering on the hopes and ambitions of the people of Scotland. That is why, like a clear majority of Scots, I believe that our nation should have the right to choose. Such a Scotland is within reach, I have no doubt. But if we want it, we have to work for it, we have to vote for it, we have to actively, purposefully, and I hope also joyfully, make it happen. It’s interesting to hear Swinney’s full-throated rhetoric in the context of ongoing criticism of the SNP’s “disastrous” strategy at the recent Hamilton byelection, which saw them lose the pivotal central Scotland Holyrood seat to Labour, and arguably talk up the threat of Reform. Although rumblings about plots to oust him as leader have been dismissed as the usual suspects on manoeuvres by senior party figures, it remains the case that there is disquiet amongst MSPs and activists about the party’s plans for Holyrood election campaign – how can the party get its independence-supporting base to the ballot box, given the low profile Swinney has given it, even sacking his minister for independence? And how does the SNP sell independence to more doubtful voters, with a cost of living crisis still biting and no clear route to a second referendum? Most curious of all, polling just ahead of the Hamilton byelection suggested that the threat of a Reform success was actually pushing more voters to support independence. Asked how they would vote in a hypothetical referendum if Nigel Farage was prime minister, the Yes side’s lead doubled to 16 points, with 58% of Scottish voters saying they would back independence. Downing Street has said that the situation in the Channel is “deteriorating”. A No 10 spokesperson used the word in a readout of Keir Starmer’s meeeting with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the G7 summit in Canada yesterday. It seemed to be a reference to small boat crossings, which are at a record high for this time of the year. The spokesperson said: [Starmer and Macron] looked ahead to the upcoming UK-France Summit in July and agreed that their teams should pursue high-ambition outcomes that deliver for the British and French people. Migration should be a key focus given the deteriorating situation in the Channel, they confirmed - adding that they should continue to work closely with other partners to find innovative ways to drive forward progress. They also agreed that the summit presents an opportune moment to further enhance our existing defence and security co-operation. In a report on attempted crossings today, PA Media says: French police teargassed migrants desperately trying to reach the UK as No 10 admitted the situation at the English Channel was getting worse. Hundreds gathered on the dunes before making dashes towards the Channel at Gravelines beach near Calais, all intent on boarding a single dinghy on Tuesday morning. The French authorities stood by and watched as those not deterred by the gas waded into the water intent on boarding a single dinghy to risk the Channel crossing. The scenes at Gravelines unfolded just hours after a meeting between Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron in Canada to address a situation No 10 acknowledged was “deteriorating”. Some 16,545 people have crossed in small boats so far in 2025 according to Home Office figures, a 45% increase on the same period in 2024. At Gravelines on Tuesday, migrants of all ages who made it to the sea had to wait in waist-deep water for almost an hour before any of them were able to board the small boat. Rachel Reeves is considering caving in to City lobbying and softening changes to inheritance tax that affect wealthy individuals who would previously have been “non-doms”, reports suggest. Heather Stewart has the story here. Keir Starmer has said that the US-UK-Australia Aukus submarine pact is going ahead. Speaking alongside Donald Trump at the G7 summit yesterday, Starmer said “we’re proceeding with” Aukus, Politico reports. There has been some doubt about the future of the deal, which will secure thousands of jobs in the UK helping to construct nuclear-powered attack submarines for Australia, because last week Washington said it was reviewing it. Starmer said Aukus was “a really important deal to both of us” and he suggested a review was just routine for a new administration. Keir Starmer has been urged by two Labour MPs to “jump” at the chance to push for reform of the European convention on human rights (ECHR). In a joint article for the Times Jake Richards (Rother Valley) and Dan Tomlinson (Chipping Barnet) say that it is increasingly clear that international human rights law will be changed, and that what is unresolved is whether it will be done by progressives or rightwing populists. Pointing out that they represent “red wall” and “blue wall” seats respectively, they say a recent ITV News report, showing foreign suspects wanted for murder and child rape are being protected from extradition by human rights law, highlights the need for change. They acknowledge that the government has already said it wants to produce new guidelines affecting the way article 8 of the convention (the right to a family life) is interpreted by judges in asylum cases. There are concerns that the courts are treating mitigating factors as “exceptional” far too often. But the two MPs suggest they want the government to go further. They say: A recent letter drafted by nine European allies called for an “open-minded conversation about the interpretation of the ECHR”. It was welcomed by the Council of Europe [the body overseeing the convention], who said the convention needed “adaptation” and that there would be “no taboo” in discussions. The government should jump at this opportunity. From bogus asylum claims to the deportation of dangerous criminals, the unwieldy reach of the modern operation of the ECHR can hamper effective government. The prime minister is right to call for an “insurgent” approach to governing, to cut through constraints to deliver on political priorities. Keir Starmer has announced a new wave of UK sanctions against Russia. In a news release, Downing Street said: The 30 targets strike across Russia’s financial, military and energy sectors in response to Putin’s continued aggression. His repeated refusals to engage seriously in peace has redoubled the UK’s resolve to apply a stranglehold on the Russian economy. The new sanctions crack down further on Putin’s shadow fleet, targeting 20 of his oil tankers. The UK is also tightening the net around those who enable Putin’s illicit oil trade, sanctioning Orion Star Group LLC and Valegro LLC-FZ, for their role in crewing and managing shadow fleet vessels. Today’s action also targets Russia’s military capabilities, hitting the military agency leading the development of Russia’s underwater intelligence gathering operations (GUGI), protecting the UK from attacks on subsea infrastructure, restricting Putin’s war machine and increasing our security at home. In addition, two UK residents Vladimir Pristoupa and Olech Tkacz operating a shadowy network of shell companies, have now been sanctioned for collectively funnelling over $120 million of electronics, many of which are on the Common High Priority goods list, to Russia. Commenting on the sanctions, Starmer said: We know that our sanctions are hitting hard, so while Putin shows total disregard for peace, we will not hesitate to keep tightening the screws. A long-awaited Stormont plan to target poverty has been criticised as “underwhelming”, PA Media reports. PA says: Communities minister Gordon Lyons (DUP) launched an extended 14-week public consultation on the executive’s anti-poverty strategy 2025-35 today. He described it as being based on three pillars of minimising risks of falling into poverty, minimising the impact of poverty on people’s lives and working to help people get out of poverty. Figures indicated that around 18% of those in Northern Ireland live in relative poverty, and 15% live in absolute poverty, with 25% of children living in relative poverty and 21% of children living in absolute poverty. The strategic commitments from across departments include continuing the extended schools programme, working with partners to scope out an NI debt relief scheme, a commitment to develop an executive disability strategy and a fuel poverty strategy. Speaking in the Assembly, Lyons described a “legacy of delay” in taking forward an anti-poverty strategy. “When I took office, I made it clear that one of my priorities would be tackling poverty,” he told MLAs. “After a legacy of delay in taking this work forward, I wanted to work at pace to develop a strategy which could help make a meaningful difference to those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage in our society. But Mark H Durkan (SDLP) from the official Opposition at Stormont described the document as “underwhelming”. He contended it didn’t just “call into question the executive’s ability to tackle poverty”, but also their appetite and ambition to do so. Helena Horton is a Guardian environment reporter. The government will not be recommended to turn water companies into not-for-profit companies under its “root and branch review” of the sector, review author Sir John Cunliffe has said. At the launch of the Cunliffe review, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said that all options - except nationalisation - were on the table, and that a non-profit model such as that used in Wales was being considered. But Cunliffe has now said the ownership structure is not the problem causing sewage spills, financial mismanagement and water shortages caused by a lack of investment. He told the Commons environment committee this morning that the review will not be recommending one ownership structure for the industry. He said: If the question is whether we will recommend a wholesale transfer to another [ownership] model, what we won’t do is say we will move the whole sector to a different model. I’m not sure how you get there without spending a very large amount of public money to buy the assets and that’s outside my terms of reference. Feargal Sharkey, former Undertones frontman turned water campaigner, said: I had absolutely no expectations for this commission whatsoever and so far I am yet to disappointed. I fail to comprehend how the interpretation of a root and branch review of the water industry is to completely exclude the issue at the heart of the industry which is ownership of the industry and the financial abuse of the water companies. Sir John is refusing to look at this because the government has told him not to. At the committee, when asked by MPs if his report was going to be “tinkering” if it was not recommending an overhaul of how water companies are owned, Cunliffe said: It’s not tinkering, it’s trying to be evidence based. I don’t think looking at the models, the evidence we have, it’s not a big data set but I don’t think the conclusive evidence is there to make a big change like that. He added that the terms of reference set by environment secretary Steve Reed rule out using public money to nationalise water companies. Cunliffe said that in the review he will “think about the investors, how they want to take their money out, are they prepared to put more equity in as investment goes up, are they looking for capital gain, are they looking for a stream of dividends over time?” and what the rules were around those issues. “It looks maybe weak but I don’t think it is,” he said. He also said the review would not make any recommendations about bonuses and pay for water company CEOs. I don’t have a problem with there being bonuses for the financial performance provided they are not at the expense of the public good. We are not going to make recommendations on particular renumeration packages for chief executives. There is a tension here between people taking pay packages they don’t deserve and recruiting and retaining. These are pretty big companies, the penalties for failure are pretty enormous. What we won’t get into is whether this [pay] is excessive. At the home affairs committee Jake Richards (Lab) asked Louise Casey is she was in favour of having a permanent child sexual abuse commissioner, who could constantly pressure the government to act on these issues. Casey said that she was “not a massive fan of constant commissioners”, having been one. (She was victims commissioner for a period). She said ministers were accountable for policy, and she also said there was already a “very good” domestic violence commissioner in place (Nicole Jacobs). Councils should “think carefully” about the need to cooperate with the national inquiry into grooming gangs, Louise Casey told the home affairs committee. She says councils should not take the view that, just because they might have carried out serious case reviews into abuse allegations, that meant there was no need for a further investigation. But she also said she did not want to see people scapegoated. Asked if there should be a specific focus on Bradford, she said: I would urge them – Bradford, anywhere – to think carefully about not being open to scrutiny and to change, and I would urge them to think carefully. And I realise it’s nerve wracking, because in the midst of all of this are some human beings that are leaders, and I don’t mean political leaders necessarily, but social workers, team leaders, police officers. We all know that when it gets nasty, they are named and very nasty people can do very nasty things to them, but you all know that, you’re MPs. So we have got to be careful about not scapegoating people and creating a hate-monger thing. At the same time that we have to make sure that we get the inquiries right and that people are held to account locally. So I would say to anybody who can see themselves in this report, be open to it. Casey told the home affairs committee that she saw the national police investigation and national inquiry into grooming gangs as “cojoined”. She said she wanted to see a “significant uplift” in prosecutions and police investigations. Back at the home affairs committee, Louise Casey has just finished giving evidence. But I will post some of the things she said while the Conservative party press conference was going on. In response to a question about how she wanted the government to respond to her report, she said she expected it to act on all her recommendations. It was not unreasonable to expect action within the next six months, she said. We did 12 knowing that we wanted some big, big shifts. I hope this is a line in the sand, and I think the 12 things that we’re asking for are not impossible. They’re not pipe dreams, they’re achievable. Badenoch is wrapping up now. She says this is one of the greatest scandals this country has seen. The Conservatives will support the government, she says. But they cannot take too long. And the inquiry must follow the evidence, she says. And that’s it from the press conference. Q: Is this a border control issue? Philp says this is the worst year for small boat crossings. He says the vast majority of arrivals are young men. And he says the Casey report says “significant numbers” of offenders are asylum seekers, or non-UK nationals. Q: Do you regret the tone you took in the Commons yesterday? Badenoch says: I do think that we should take the politics out of it. But she goes to attack Labour – claiming they were the first to politicise this issue. But who was it that said when we raised this issue that we were pandering to the far right? That’s what brought the politics into it. Who was it that said that this was dog whistle politics? It was Keir Starmer and his ministers. She says it is her job to hold the government to account. She says, speaking here on a platform with survivors, she is not being political. But in the Commons she will raise politics, she says. “We are politicians – politics is what we do.” She goes on: When I’m in the Houses of Parliament, when I’m in the Commons, I will do politics. And I think that it is wrong for people to tone police those who are pointing out when something has gone wrong. That is what happened to Sajid Javid when he was talking about ethnicity. That is what happened to Suella Braverman. That is what happened to many people who were bringing up these cases. I remember hearing one survivor say that they reported that an Asian man had taken their son and the police were more interested in the language she used and said that she couldn’t describe him as that, that that was racist. That’s what really worries me. Q: Will you offer an apology to survivors for the failures of the past government? Badenoch says she has apologised to survivors. But apologies are easy, she says. She says: I have apologised, but what I find extraordinary is that more people are interested in prosecuting a government that did some things … rather than looking at what needs to happen right now …. No one here has asked me for more apologies. They have heard the apologies. Apologies are easy. What we need to see is action. We can sit here and say sorry all day long, but what I actually want to see is an inquiry that gets at the bottom of this. Yesterday Badenoch was demanding an apology from Keir Starmer. Badenoch says Sajid Javid and Suella Braverman were “vilified” for saying that race was a factor in this offending. Badenoch is now taking questions. She starts with Charlie Peters, the reporter who has led the GB News coverage of this issue. Q: Will you ensure Westminster, including the CPS, are investigated by the inquiry over cover-up allegations? Badenoch says the inquiry should follow the evidence. No one should be out of scope, she says. She says most of what was in Louise Casey’s report “I felt I had seen before, and I knew”. She says a national inquiry could have been ordered sooner. Badenoch invites Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, to speak. She says the Tories have set tests to judge the inquiry. Philp says the authorites were not just negligent; they deliberately covered up these crimes, he says. He cites the case he talked about on Sky News yesterday involving a police officer actively deciding not to investigate abuse allegations. He says people who covered up this crime should be prosecuted for misconduct in public office. That should happen alongside the inquiry, he says. He says all 50 towns where grooming has happened should be investigated. (It was GB News that said 50 towns were involved). He says all councils should cooperate. And he says the inquiry should start soon. The terms of references, and the chair, should be announced before the summer recess. At the Tory press conference, the survivors and relatives are talking about how hard it has been to get the police to the issue seriously. They say that going to the media has been important in getting the police to act. The next speaker is a mother whose son was abused from the age of 13. He was in the care system. As an adult, he went to the police. Sadly, he died, she says. She says it took 10 years for the case to get to court. Her son died before the case could go to court, she says. Badenoch invites the woman to say more about the court process. The victim’s mother says she thinks the restrictions imposed on the suspect were not strict enough. Badenoch invites her next contributor, Fiona, to speak. She says the inquiry needs to engage with victims. They feel let down, she says. Badenoch asks her to elaborate on her concerns about delays. Fiona says victims need more support. She recalls the way her hair fell out when her case went to trial because of the stress. Badenoch invites her first contributor to speak. He is the father of a survivor. He says he wants professionals to be held accountable. He says he is not reassured this will happen. His daughter was groomed from the age of 14, but as she grew older she was passed on to other groomers. Victims get passed on, he says. Kemi Badenoch is holding her press conference now. There is a live feed here. She says she thinks the views of survivors have not been heard enough. That is what she will focus on today. She says the Tories welcome the decision to hold a national inquiry. She says she decided a national inquiry was needed when the scale of the problem became apparent. Q: Should the devolved governments contribute to the national inquiry? Casey says she would be disappointed if the national criminal investiation did not involve Scotland. It is easy for criminals to move from England to Scotland, she says. She says it is “really important” that there is join-up between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, she says. Joani Reid (Lab) says she is a Scottish MP. She asks if Casey spoke to any devolved organisations when doing her report. Casey says people in Britain should not read her report and think this could not happen here. In Scotland police forces were merged into Police Scotland. So there data sharing should be better, she says. Reid suggests it isn’t. Casey is back talking about data. She says sharing data is easier now than at any time before in her career. And it is not expensive. But privacy concerns can be a problem. Often these are used to justify institutions protecting their interests, she suggests. Q: Do we need a complete overhaul of police IT? Sarah Kincaid, a policy adviser at the Home Office, says you do not need a whole new system. She says you can use new tools withing existing systems. Casey cites work being done by Befordshire police as an example of good practice. You do not need to spend “300 years” on a digital overhaul, she says. Jake Richards (Lab) ask Casey why she changed her mind on a national inquiry. Casey says, early on, she was doubtful about the need for another inquiry. The Alexis Jay one was very thorough. And, as someone who has written reports that have not been implemented, she knows the importance of focusing on implementing recommendations. But she says, without a national inquiry, she realised they would not deal with the issue of accountability. She says she is in favour of catching criminals. Her view initially was, if money was available, it should go to the police, to help them catch criminals. But then the government said it would set up five local inquiries. But Oldham was the only council that wanted to do one, he says. The others were not volunteering. And then she looked at the assurance reviews carried out for Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester. These showed that authorities were withholding information, and lawyering up. These reviews were taking years, and not getting to the truth. Casey says in the past government has talked relentlessly about the need for better data sharing between departments. But she says there is a need to consider making this mandatory. She says, until she came back to this issue to conduct her audit, she did not realise the “paucity of technology” available to support the police. She goes on: I was there when the tragedy of Soham happened. We knew at that point that if we had had better data sharing there’s a possibility that we might have saved those girls’ lives. There’s certaintly an absolute clarity that intelligence would have been much faster in either avoiding it or or actually finding that dreadful human being earlier. And we’ve known that forever onwards. And so I think there is also an issue that the Home Office can’t drag their feet on, looking at police intelligence systems, given we’ve living in the 21st century. Probably everbody in this room can connect within seconds. Yet we had Befordshire police finding a young boy that was being, in my mind trafficked to London. But the data intelligence system did not make it easy for them to find that he was in Deptford and being circled and dealt with by predators. Casey says this may not be a big issue for the public, but it is “a very big issue for the system”. Referring to the national inquiry, Casey says she wants this to be different from the types of inquiry that have happened before. On data, she says national data on grooming gangs is “incomplete and unreliable”. That is to put it mildly, she says. She says this is a form of irrresponsibility. She says: I feel very strongly on issues that are as searing as people’s race, when we know the prejudice and racism that people of colour experience in this country, to not get how you treat that data right is a different level of public irresponsibility. Sorry, to put it so bluntly, I didn’t put it that bluntly yesterday, but I think it’s particularly important if you are collecting those sorts of issues to get them 100% right. And if you are not getting them 100% right, please don’t use them to justify another position, which is potentially what happened. That may be well meaning, it may not be well meaning, but that’s how the data has run. And I think the sooner we bring a close to that – my view is collect something or don’t collect something. For God’s sake, don’t half collect it. That’s a bloody disaster, frankly. She says, even where data has been collected on ethnicity, it has only talked about people being of Asian or Pakistani heritage. She says that bundles people together in one big grouping. It is not helpful, she says. UPDATE: Casey also said: When we asked the good people of Greater Manchester Police to help us look at the data we also collected – I think it’s in the report – what was happening with child abuse more generally, and of course … if you look at the data on child sexual exploitation, suspects and offenders, it’s disproportionately Asian heritage. If you look at the data for child abuse, it is not disproportionate, and it is white men. So again, just note to everybody, really outside here rather than in here. Let’s just keep calm here about how you interrogate data and what you draw from it. Casey says it is important to stress that group-based sexual exploitation is still rare. It is a heinous crime, but it is rare, she says. She says she is “fairly sure” it is still happening. And she thinks people do not look hard enough to find victims. She says she has gone “quite hard” on the need to properly treat Rotherham. This was partly inspired by her experience in Rotherham, where there was a girl who was raped multiple times on her 13th birthday as a supposed birthday present. That is why she wants to change the law on rape, she says. Louise Casey has just started giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about her grooming gangs report. She starts by saying she was surprised to be asked to re-engage in this issue, given that she published a report into abuse in Rotherham 10 years ago. But it was right to reopen the issue, she says. She says she even asked herself if she had done enough given what she found in Rotherham. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. The Conservatives are calling for the new national grooming gangs inquiry to be extended to cover Scotland. At present, it is only due to cover England and Wales. Andrew Bowie, the shadow Scottish secretary, has proposed this in a letter to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary. He said: Now that the Labour government has finally bowed to the huge public demand for a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal it is essential that it is truly national in scope. That means extending the remit to include Scotland, where there have been well-documented cases of gangs responsible for the rape and sexual abuse of young women. The home secretary must work with the Scottish Government to agree the scope of the inquiry because it’s imperative that the voices of Scottish victims of these vile gangs are heard and appropriate lessons learned for the future. Kemi Badenoch is not the only party leader being accused of opportunism over grooming gangs. Rupert Lowe, who was elected as a Reform UK MP but who left the party after a bitter row with Nigel Farage, posted this on social media this morning. I sat next to Farage in the Commons when he stated that Reform would ‘raise the money’ for a rape gang inquiry. I applauded him. For that, I am sorry. Nothing happened. Nothing was done. Reform did nothing. It is filthy politics, and I feel deeply ashamed for my role in it. Steel trade unions have said it is “absolutely vital” that the UK rapidly secures a deal to protect the sector from Donald Trump’s tariffs, after the industry was excluded from an initial UK-US pact signed last night, Julia Kollewe and Jasper Jolly report. Here are some pictures of Keir Starmer at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada, yesterday (where many of the events happened late evening or overnight UK time). Keir Starmer and Donald Trump signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with the US president saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs “because I like them”, Peter Walker reports. Under the deal, the UK aerospace sector avoids all US tariffs, and the car industry faces tariffs of 10%, down from 25%. But the steel industy still faces tariffs of 25%. Speaking about the deal on BBC Breakfast this morning, Heidi Alexander, the transport secrtary, said: We’re working through some technical detail around steel because we want to bring that 25% tariff that applies at the moment obviously down further. But I think the fact that we’re in this unique position, we’re the only country in the world to have already got a trade agreement with the US. We are working on getting that implemented. We’ve made some progress on car manufacturing, which is going to be really important for companies such as Jaguar Land Rover based in Solihull. Also on aerospace, as you will have heard, really important for companies like Rolls-Royce, and we’re determined to go further and we’ll be working on those issues around steel in the coming days, weeks and months. Good morning. After the Home Office yesterday published Louise Casey’s audit of the grooming gang scandal, none of the political parties at Westminster seriously challenged any of her conclusions, or recommendations. But, of course, that does not mean there was consensus. As reported here yesterday, an almighty blame game commenced (or resumed, to be more accurate). In an interview on Newsnight last night, Casey said she was “disappointed” by the way her report was being politicised and criticised the Conservatives in particular. Asked what she felt about the “politicisation” of her report, Casey replied: I’m disappointed by it, to put it mildly. I really hoped – and hope still – that the report is so clear, it’s so straightforward. We need to change some laws. We need to do a national criminal investigation. We need to get on with the national inquiry with local footprint in it. And ideally, wouldn’t it be great if everybody came behind that and just backed it and got on with it? Asked what she felt about the proceedings in the Commons yesterday, Casey said: I just felt, dare I say it, I felt the opposition could have just been a bit, ‘Yes, we will all come together behind you.’ Maybe there’s still time to do that. I think it’s just so important that they do. It almost doesn’t matter right now, does it, what political party people are part of. We’ve identified there’s a problem, it’s been a problem there a long time, and it’s about time we drew a line in the sand. There does not seem much chance that Kemi Badenoch will take any notice. She has scheduled a press conference today and, judging by her X feed last night, she intends to celebrate what she perceives as a victory for her campaigning. The 10 most recent posts on her feed are either tweets or retweets about the grooming gang scandal. This is the one she has pinned. This national inquiry is a hard-won victory for the brave survivors who refused to be silenced — who gave up their anonymity to expose the institutions that failed them. Labour fought it every step of the way. They voted against it. Mocked campaigners. Smeared them. Branded it a “far-right bandwagon” and a “dog whistle.” Now they’re pretending they supported it all along? Disgraceful. Their hand was forced. Our job now is to make sure this inquiry delivers justice for every survivor. No more delays. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Angela Rayner, deputy prime minister, chairs cabinet. Keir Starmer is still in Canada at the G7 summit. 10.30am: Louise Casey, the crossbench peer and former civil servant, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about her grooming gangs report published yesterday. 11am: Kemi Badenoch holds a press conference. Noon: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 1pm: John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, gives a speech on independence at the Scotland 2050 conference in Edinburgh. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, is speaking at 2.10pm. Early afternoon (UK time): Starmer takes questions from British print journalists and broadcasters at the G7 summit. Late afternoon: MPs debate amendments to the crime and policing bill relating to abortion. They will vote at 7pm. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.","2025-06-17T19:24:39Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/17/louise-casey-grooming-gangs-kemi-badenoch-conservatives-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live-news-updates"
"abortion","Nigel Farage is cosying up to the US anti-abortion group that challenged Roe v Wade. Women in Britain should know that","Nigel Farage’s obsession with free speech has become the mood music of his own party, the Conservatives and the BBC, so it shouldn’t have been shocking or troubling to learn that he’d testified in the US Congress on 3 September on the subject of this elemental liberty, and how profoundly at risk it is in the UK. His position we could recite in our sleep – it hasn’t deviated, and remains nonsense on stilts. Free speech is only at risk in the UK insofar as 80-year-olds can now be arrested for opposing genocide with homemade placards, and that’s quite a big “only”. But in Nigel’s upside-down world he is remorselessly censored, and a leftist cabal is still calling the shots – and will only get stronger. The troubling element wasn’t what he said, but who orchestrated his appearance. The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is a conservative Christian lobby group whose allies include JD Vance and speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who used to work as an ADF lawyer. While their focus, brokering Farage’s appearance in Congress (the formal invitation came from the House judiciary committee) is on free speech, the legal challenges they bring, both in the US and internationally, tend to use the issue instrumentally as a way to gain allies in their battle against reproductive rights. ADF UK has given legal support to people who’ve been prosecuted for protesting outside abortion clinics, breaching the UK’s “buffer zones”, and to the midwife who was suspended from her job for making anti-abortion statements on social media. It also uses the existence of legislation against this harassment as proof of a free-speech crisis in the country. The two issues are thus conjoined in a ratchet, where any victory in one becomes grist for the other. The buffer-zones debate works particularly well, appealing as it does to a progressive sense of fair-mindedness – come on, liberal, if you want to be allowed to call out a genocide, who are you to stop a Christian calling out a pregnant woman for murdering a baby? It’s an argument whose bad faith you can smell a mile off, but it’s enough to sow confusion and turn the wokerati against itself. When Farage was head of the Brexit party, it had no stance on abortion. The New York Times could find no record of his having done so, anyway, and knowing him as we all do, you can’t imagine it: it doesn’t chime at all with the smoking, pint-loving, British pound sterling and sovereignty guy, to be digging around in women’s business. Yet as if by magic, suddenly last November, he wanted to talk about rolling back the abortion time limit “given that we can now save babies at 22 weeks” (the time limit is 24). By May this year, the current limit was “absolutely ludicrous” , according to Nigel. Although he did say to New York Times reporters that it was “bollocks” to say he had found a new interest in the topic of reproductive rights. ADF lawyers have told journalists explicitly that their goal, long term, is to see abortion rights curtailed in the UK – to which one’s every synapse screams, “in your dreams, you hubristic fantasists”. But we’ve seen how fast the current Labour leadership and the Conservatives scramble to meet Reform UK halfway. We have already seen how influenced by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 the Conservatives are: from seeing renewable energy as a way to future-proof the economy to now seeing it as a woke conspiracy we can’t afford. Five years ago, it would have been considered tawdry to be interested in the physiology of whoever was in the toilet cubicle next to you, and now it is a matter for the UK supreme court. Attitudes to migration were becoming steadily more positive from 2015. However, in 2023, they flipped negative, and have since galvanised a hardcore of protesters whose aggression has since torched asylum hotels and left foreign-born carers scared to get out of their cars. Which politicians do you trust to stand up to what is basically authoritarian empire-building? Because the time to start supporting them is now, not five to midnight.

"abortion","‘We must be alert to complacency’: inside Victoria’s push to extend abortion access","On a grey Monday morning outside the State Library in Melbourne’s CBD, there’s little to suggest anything out of the ordinary – no protests, no placards, no media. But stream of women – and a few men – are making their way inside for what is, in fact, a landmark event. “How extraordinary it is,” says former Victorian health minister and MC Jill Hennessy, “to come to a symposium about abortion as healthcare in the state of Victoria, [and] that this isn’t some secret meeting held down in an underground tunnel where women plot to ensure our health rights are recognised.” The plotting, many in the room would argue, is happening elsewhere – and increasingly in plain sight, as highlighted by the symposium’s opening video: a montage of US vice-president JD Vance denouncing abortion rights, a news clip from a recent failed bid in South Australia to wind back the state’s laws and a scene from The Handmaid’s Tale. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s Afternoon Update email newsletter It’s dramatic, but the message is clear: even in Victoria, where abortion laws are considered among the most progressive in the country, nothing is guaranteed. “We must be alert to complacency,” the state’s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, tells the room of health professionals. “The laws are just the beginning. Unless they lead to action, they’re worth nothing.” A report by the not-for-profit Women’s Health Victoria, published last year, found 53 out of Victoria’s 79 local government areas in 2023 had no surgical abortion provider, and 15 had no medical abortion provider. At the time, only 17% of Victorian GPs provided access to medical abortions and 19% of pharmacies in the state dispensed the medication. Those figures have increased significantly since national restrictions on MS-2 Step, the medication used for medical abortion, were relaxed, says Prof Danielle Mazza, head of Monash University’s department of general practice and the SPHERE Centre for Research Excellence in women’s sexual and reproductive health. “Since deregulation of medical abortion happened in 2023 we’ve had almost three times as many GPS and twice as many pharmacists [across Australia] provide medical abortion for the first time,” she says. Mazza says in 2019, almost a third of Australian women – and half of those in remote areas – lived in regions where MS-2 Step was not available because it hadn’t been prescribed by a local GP. In Victoria, medical abortions can be administered up to nine weeks’ gestation, while surgical abortions can be performed up to 24 weeks, though they typically occur by 12. Now, Mazza is advocating to extend access to medical abortion from nine to 10 weeks’ gestation. A submission to the Therapeutic Goods Administration by Marie Stopes International is now under way, she says. Since taking on the health portfolio, Thomas has introduced a suite of reforms including 20 sexual and reproductive health hubs across Victoria, scholarships for women’s health specialists and a mobile clinic that now delivers medical abortion services to women in remote and regional parts of the state. During her regular visits to public hospitals, Thomas has also taken the direct approach of asking whether they provide abortion care. “I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how many have said yes,” she says. It’s a contrast with New South Wales, where just three of the state’s 220 public hospitals are routinely providing abortions, according to research by the University of Sydney. Structural barriers remain But while these changes mark progress, speakers at the symposium are clear that change on the ground is often slower and uneven. Carolyn Mogharbel, manager of 1800 My Options – a free, anonymous phone line run by Women’s Health Victoria that has fielded over 40,000 calls since launching in 2018 – says affordability remains one of the biggest barriers. “In the past year, 35 to 40% of people of our callers don’t have the means to pay for their sexual and reproductive health services,” she says, up from previous figures of 20 to 30%. Many callers can’t afford to attend a private clinic, pay for a dating scan – typically about $200 – or even for a GP consultation to get a prescription. The total cost, she says, can exceed $1,000, not including time off work, travel costs or childcare. Then there are the structural barriers. Mogharbel shared the story of a caller who, at 11 weeks pregnant, had been referred to five different metropolitan hospitals. Only the fifth hospital said they provided abortions, but told her they wouldn’t be able to see her before she passed their 12-week gestational limit. Another caller, a 19-year-old, was told by her family GP she would “regret” her decision and should consider “the joys of parenthood”. “The doctor, who had watched her grow up, said they were really looking forward to watching this next generation grow up too,” Mogharbel says. A second GP referred her to a clinic that said it would cost $600 for a termination. Catherine Bateman, a nurse practitioner with Latrobe Community Health, says Victoria should be “the shining light of the whole world” for abortion access. “But it’s not. Why is that? And not to be too controversial, but doctors.” Of the 40,000 GPs in Australia, Bateman says only a “minuscule percentage of them” offer abortion care. “That’s appalling.” Bateman says some delay patients with ultrasounds – despite clinical guidelines stating that they are not always required. Others invoke the state’s conscientious objection laws – which require doctors with moral objections to refer patients elsewhere. Bateman says the laws are “not working” and are “being used as a cover”. Lily McAuliffe, co-founder of peer support network The Abortion Project, says the need for care after an abortion procedure is often overlooked. Even as someone who is firmly pro-choice, she felt isolated and overwhelmed after her own abortion. “It was a really messy grey area,” she says. For Mazza, the path forward is clear. She points to the UK, where abortion is publicly funded via the NHS, with centralised data collection and a target of a one-week wait time between initial consultation and procedure. In Ireland, GPs are paid €450 to provide medical abortion, and ultrasounds are free through private radiology clinics when required. Her vision, she says, is of “a future with fewer unplanned pregnancies, every child a wanted child” and equitable access to abortion at no cost.","2025-05-03T20:00:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/04/victoria-abortion-access"
"abortion","Planned Parenthood CEO warns budget bill could devastate group and slash abortion access in blue states","Planned Parenthood stands to lose roughly $700m in federal funding if the US House passes Republicans’ massive spending-and-tax bill, the organization’s CEO said on Wednesday, amounting to what abortion rights supporters and opponents alike have called a “backdoor abortion ban”. “We are facing down the reality that nearly 200 health centers are at risk of closure. We’re facing a reality of the impact on shutting down almost half of abortion-providing health centers,” Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood Federation of Americas’s CEO, said in an interview Wednesday morning. “It does feel existential. Not just for Planned Parenthood, but for communities that are relying on access to this care.” Anti-abortion activists have longed to “defund” Planned Parenthood for decades. They are closer than ever to achieving their goal. That $700m figure represents the loss that Planned Parenthood would face from a provision in the spending bill that would impose a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits that offer abortions and that received more than $800,000 in federal funding in 2023, as well as the funding that Planned Parenthood could lose from Title X, the nation’s largest family-planning program. In late March, the Trump administration froze tens of millions of dollars of Title X funding that had been set aside for some Planned Parenthood and other family-planning clinics. “Essentially what you are seeing is a gutting of a safety net,” said McGill Johnson, who characterized the bill as a “backdoor abortion ban” in a statement. Medicaid is the US government’s insurance program for low-income people, and about 80 million people use it. If the latest version of the spending-and-tax bill passes, nearly 12 million people are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage. Donald Trump has said that he would like the bill to be on his desk, ready for a signature, by 4 July. The provision attacking Planned Parenthood would primarily target clinics in blue states that have protected abortion rights since the overturning of Roe v Wade three years ago, because those blue states have larger numbers of people on Medicaid. Although not all Planned Parenthood clinics perform abortions, the reproductive healthcare giant provides 38% of US abortions, according to the latest data from Abortion Care Network, a membership group for independent abortion clinics. Among the clinics at risk of closure, Planned Parenthood estimated, more than 90% are in states that permit abortion. Sixty percent are located in areas that have been deemed “medically underserved”. In total, more than 1.1 million Planned Parenthood patients could lose access to care. “There’s nowhere else for folks” to go, McGill Johnson said. “The community health centers have said they cannot absorb the patients that Planned Parenthood sees. So I think that we do need to just call it a targeted attack because that’s exactly how it is.” Nationally, 11% of female Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 15 and 49 and who receive family-planning services go to Planned Parenthood for a range of services, according to an analysis by the non-profit KFF, which tracks healthcare policy. Those numbers rise in blue states like Washington, Oregon and Connecticut. In California, that number soars to 29%. The impact on the state would be so devastating that Nichole Ramirez, senior vice-president of communication and donor relations at Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties, called the tax-and-spending package’s provision “a direct attack on us, really”. “They haven’t been able to figure out how to ban abortion nationwide and they haven’t been able to figure out how to ban abortion in California specifically,” said Ramirez, who estimated that Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties stands to lose between $40m and $60m. Ramirez continued: “This is their way to go about banning abortion. That is the entire goal here.” In a post on X, the prominent anti-abortion group Live Action reposted an image of a Planned Parenthood graphic calling the provision “backdoor abortion ban”. “They might be onto us,” Live Action wrote. The Planned Parenthood network is overseen by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, but it also consists of dozens of independent regional affiliates that operate nearly 600 clinics across the country. In June, as the spending-and-tax bill moved through Congress, Autonomy News, an outlet that focuses on threats to bodily autonomy, reported that Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s accreditation board had sent waivers out to affiliates to apply for approval to cease providing abortions in order to preserve access to Medicaid funding. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that a memo sent to the leadership of one California affiliate suggests that leaders there had considered ending abortion services. McGill Johnson said that there have been discussions within Planned Parenthood’s network about what it would mean to stop offering abortions. But no affiliates, to her knowledge, are moving forward with plans to stop performing the procedure. “Educating our volunteers and teams around hard decisions to stand and understand the impact of that is different than weighing and considering a stoppage of abortion,” McGill Johnson said. The budget bill and Title X funding freeze aren’t the only sources of pressure on the group. The US supreme court last week ruled in favor of South Carolina in a case involving the state’s attempt to kick Planned Parenthood out of its state Medicaid reimbursement program – a ruling that will likely give a green light to other states that also want to defund Planned Parenthood. At least one other organization that provides abortion and family-planning services, Maine Family Planning, will be affected by the provision, according to the organization’s CEO, George Hill. Maine Family Planning directly operates 18 clinics, including several that provide primary care or are in rural, medically underserved areas. If the provision takes effect, Hill estimates, the organization would lose 20% of its operating budget. “It’s dressed up as a budget provision, but it’s not,” Hill said. “They’re basically taking the rug out from under our feet.”","2025-07-02T22:15:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/planned-parenthood-abortion-ban-trump-bill"
"abortion","UK woman accused of illegal abortion says she told medics she had miscarried","A woman on trial accused of having an illegal abortion has said she told hospital staff she had miscarried as she feared them knowing the truth would affect the level of care she received. Nicola Packer, 45, took abortion medicine during the Covid lockdown in November 2020, after being prescribed the pills in a remote consultation with a registered provider, a jury at Isleworth crown court heard. She is charged with “unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing” with the “intent to procure a miscarriage”. The prosecution allege she had known she was beyond the legal time limit when she took the medication, mifepristone and misoprostol, which Packer denies. Packer wept as she gave evidence at her trial in west London, telling the jury she thought that she could have died after giving birth to a foetus which was about six months old. She told the jury she had sincerely believed that she was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion, and was “shocked” to have given birth to a significantly more developed foetus. The defendant initially told hospital staff that she believed she was between 16 and 18 weeks pregnant and had miscarried, before telling staff she was 10 weeks pregnant and had taken abortion medication once she began to “trust” them. “What do you mean by trust?” asked Alexandra Felix KC for the prosecution. “What on earth made you think that medical professionals wouldn’t help you?” “I thought if I went to the hospital with a dead baby they wouldn’t help me,” replied Packer. “I don’t know why I thought that but that’s what I thought.” Felix told the jury that Packer was aware she was more than 10 weeks pregnant at the time, and changed her story when she “knew the game was up”. She denied this, and told the jury that had she known she was that far into her pregnancy, she wouldn’t have taken the pills. Packer, visibly upset throughout much of the cross-examination, also told the jury that she gave the hospital staff inaccurate times in relation to the abortion because she was “going through a really traumatic event”. The staff informed her that, considering the size of the foetus and the circumstances of the delivery, they would have to inform the police. Packer was arrested after attending hospital, having taken the foetus – which was estimated to be about 26 weeks’ gestation – with her in a bag, the trial previously heard. The medication had been prescribed to Packer under legislation introduced during the Covid pandemic, which allowed pills to be sent by post in cases of pregnancies under 10 weeks’ gestation. Terminations are usually available up to 23 weeks and six days of pregnancy, with no time limits in place in certain circumstances, such as evidence of a severe foetal anomaly, or if the mother’s life is at risk. The trial continues.","2025-05-02T16:32:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/02/uk-woman-accused-of-abortion-says-she-told-medics-she-had-miscarried"
"abortion","UK woman accused of illegal abortion did not look pregnant, friend tells court","There was “absolutely nothing” to indicate that a woman accused of taking abortion pills illegally was pregnant in the weeks before she delivered a foetus, a court has heard. Nicola Packer, 44, is on trial at Isleworth crown court accused of administering poison with intent to procure a miscarriage in November 2020, during the second Covid lockdown. She obtained the pills after a remote consultation with MSI, a registered provider referred to in court as Marie Stopes, which had been prescribed to her under legislation that allows pills to be sent by post in pregnancies of under 10 weeks’ gestation. She was arrested at the hospital she attended after delivering a foetus at home. The crown’s case is that Packer did not believe she was less than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the drugs. The remote prescribing legislation was introduced during the Covid crisis, before being made permanent. Terminations are usually available up to 23 weeks and six days of pregnancy, with no time limits in place in certain circumstances, such as a severe foetal anomaly or if the mother’s life is at risk. Giving evidence via video link, the witness, who cannot be named, said that Packer, whom she said she had been friends with for years, had come to stay with her and her husband during lockdown. The jury heard that while staying with the couple – at their home in the UK and when the three travelled abroad together – the friend would regularly see Packer without clothes. They had spent time in a swimming pool and in hot tubs, the court heard, and were comfortable enough together that Packer would not wear many clothes in the house. The friend said she would see her “cooking with very little on, or walking round the house with very little on”. “You were able to see her with no clothes on right up until the end of October 2020,” Fiona Horlick KC, defending Packer, said, addressing the friend. “There was nothing that ever indicated to you that she was pregnant?” Horlick asked. “Nothing,” the friend said, “absolutely nothing.” She said she had noticed “no change in dress size. No, nothing.” The friend also said that Packer had not changed her drinking habits at any point, and described herself, her husband and Packer drinking “a lot” of wine and cocktails together. In October, she said, there was “no change from any other month, really”. She also told the court that “some time in October” Packer had also “asked to borrow tampons”, later confirming to the court that she had supplied her with these, and said this was around the time they were isolating at home having returned from a trip abroad early that month. “We had discussions about period pains, had discussions about whether hers were worse than mine, because I was going through menopause,” the friend said. “We had a discussion about that in October, she asked whether I had any tampons.” Photographs of the defendant, some of which showed her in a state of undress, were also shown to the jury and the witness by the defence. “I would like to make it crystal clear that it was the defence who chose to show those photographs to the witness,” the judge, Martin Edmunds KC, said. “They did so as part of the defence case, and clearly with the consent of the defendant.” Also giving evidence, DC Lucy Gallimore told the court that after Packer phoned MSI on 2 November to seek an appointment for a termination, web searches on her phone included “is at home abortion treatment effective up to 12 weeks” and “abortion limit UK”. She is alleged to have taken the pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, on 6 November. The trial, which is scheduled to last between five and six weeks, continues.","2025-04-25T16:50:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/25/uk-woman-nicola-packer-accused-of-abortion-did-not-look-pregnant-friend-tells-court"
"abortion","Polish election: Tusk party urged to show it is not ‘deceiving women’ on abortion","Poland’s presidential elections are a “historic, groundbreaking” chance for Donald Tusk’s centrist party to show it was not trying to “deceive women” when it promised to change some of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws, campaigners have said. Voters across Poland will head to the polls on Sunday in the first round of the elections to replace Andrzej Duda, the current president who is aligned with the former rightwing government and has veto power over legislation. Polls have suggested the frontrunner is Rafał Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, whose centrist Civic Coalition led by the prime minister, Donald Tusk, has promised to relax abortion laws. But in recent weeks his lead has narrowed and support has climbed for Karol Nawrocki of the populist, anti-abortion Law and Justice (PiS) party, suggesting the two could be pitted against each other in a runoff vote on 1 June. Five years after its near-total ban on abortion set off the largest protests in the country since the fall of communism, the elections will be critical in determining whether there will finally be change in Poland, said Antonina Lewandowska of Federa, the federation for women and family planning. She said: “This is the election that will let us know how much of a chance we have to push through with an actual legislative change. This is the moment we will actually have the power to say: ‘You can do something, just as you promised.’” In the lead-up to the 2023 parliamentary elections, the topic of abortion loomed large, with Tusk vowing that any government led by him would liberalise the laws within 100 days of being elected. More than 500 days later, the near-total ban remains in place. Tusk has said his government has little room to manoeuvre given that Duda has a veto. “And so if we come up with a president who would be willing to sign a new bill to improve access to abortion in Poland, it would be a historic, groundbreaking moment when the parliament actually has the possibility to do something,” said Lewandowska. The onus would be on the government to carry through on the promises that were made to women, who turned out in record numbers to vote in 2023. “That would be an ‘aha moment’,” she said. “It would be an opportunity to actually see whether they are willing to do something or were they just trying to buy time and deceive women who won the elections for the current governing coalition.” Currently, surgical abortion is only permitted in Poland in cases of rape, incest or if there are threats to the mother’s health or life. In the lead-up to the 2023 parliamentary elections, NGOs linked the restrictions to the deaths of at least six women, as campaigners said some doctors had prioritised saving foetuses due to either ideological reasons or in an effort to avoid legal consequences. Tusk’s task has been made more complicated by the ideological divide within his coalition, which includes lawmakers on the left and staunch social conservatives. In August, Tusk conceded there was “simply no majority” to change the laws to allow abortions until the 12th week of pregnancy but said he would resume efforts after the presidential election. Tusk said his government was working to establish new procedures in the prosecutor’s office and in Polish hospitals in the hope of easing some of the de facto restrictions. Marta Lempart of the Polish Women’s Strike, a key player in organising the mass protests, said she was certain the coalition would not keep its promises on abortion. But she was still urging people to vote, pointing to the prominent presence of far-right candidates in the election. Lempart said: “We’re voting for the lesser evil. We’re not voting for things to get better; we’re voting so that it doesn’t get worse.” A rightwing president would probably be able to use their veto to stymie anything coming out of the parliament and influence the judiciary, she said. “It means absolutely nothing will change, even if they finally try – and people will be really frustrated,” Lempart said, paving the way for the possible return to power of the populist Law and Justice party, with the possible support of the far-right Confederation coalition. While Trzaskowski has vowed to sign off on legislation allowing abortions up to 12 weeks, he has sought to focus the campaign elsewhere, promising a hardline on migration and security in the hope of wooing conservative voters, said Natalia Broniarczyk of the NGO Abortion Dream Team. In March, amid frustrations at the slow pace of change, Broniarczyk and a handful of other campaigners took matters into their own hands, setting up the first pregnancy termination centre in democratic Poland. While nearly 200 queries poured in during the first week, the clinic was also beset by a dozen or so people who have held near-daily protests. “They’re so aggressive,” said Broniarczyk. “They are torturing us with noise for four hours almost every day.” The protesters had thrown acid at the centre’s windows and door twice, she claimed. “We freaked out, we were worried about the girls [coming in], we were worried about ourselves.” Broniarczyk said the mayor’s office had yet to address the situation, instead shifting responsibility to the police. “It probably shouldn’t be a surprise for us, but I am a little bit surprised. Not about the threats, that’s something I was prepared for, but this lack of reaction from politicians.” The city of Warsaw did not reply to a request for comment. The silence contrasted sharply with some on the far right who have seized on the issue of abortion to seemingly galvanise votes. In March, one far-right candidate who has lagged in the polls stormed a hospital to confront a doctor who had lawfully carried out a legal late termination. The doctor later said she was left facing death threats and abuse. While the New Left candidate, Magdalena Biejat, was an exception in that she had helped to arrange protection for the centre, Broniarczyk believed the silence of the other candidates was a hint of how some were only prepared to embrace abortion rights when the topic was politically expedient. Biejat said: “Every day we see politicians who, on the TV or radio, say you should vote for my party because we are the guarantee for women’s rights. But when we are facing attacks, they don’t react, they don’t do anything.”","2025-05-15T13:45:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/poland-elections-tusk-centrists-abortion-laws-campaign-europe"
"abortion","Judge strikes down license requirement for abortion providers in Missouri","In a massive victory for abortion rights supporters, a Missouri judge on Friday blocked a licensing requirement for abortion clinics that providers said prevented them from offering the procedure. Planned Parenthood announced shortly after the judge’s ruling that its clinics would once again perform abortions in Missouri. “Abortion services are resuming in Missouri!” Planned Parenthood Great Plains, an affiliate that operates in Missouri, announced on Facebook. “We are excited to soon offer care at select Missouri health centers, ensuring safe, compassionate and essential reproductive healthcare for those who need it.” Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, another Missouri affiliate, added in a statement: “Our health center staff are quickly readying to restart this critical care in the coming days.” Abortions have been virtually banned in Missouri since 2022, when the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and permitted much of the nation’s south and midwest regions to outlaw the procedure. But in November, Missouri residents voted to pass a ballot measure adding abortion rights to the state constitution. The ACLU of Missouri, Planned Parenthood Great Plains and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers then sued Missouri to strike down a bevy of anti-abortion laws. The Jackson county circuit court judge Jerri Zhang agreed to halt a number of those laws in December. But Zhang left in place a requirement that abortion clinics be licensed by the Missouri department of health and senior services – a policy that Planned Parenthood said in court papers was “medically unnecessary”. While that requirement was in place, the reproductive healthcare giant said its clinics could not perform abortions in Missouri. “It was so weaponized when we had to get licensure from the state. The state would delay,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told the Guardian in December. “They would force us to litigate to get a license.” Planned Parenthood asked Zhang to reconsider the ruling. In her Friday order, Zhang declared that the licensing requirement was “discriminatory”. “It does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated healthcare, including miscarriage care,” Zhang wrote. The Missouri attorney general is likely to appeal Zhang’s ruling.","2025-02-15T15:14:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/judge-strikes-down-licensing-requirement-abortion-providers-missouri"
"abortion","New figures shed light on US abortion travel as Trump cuts tracking research","For the second year in a row, abortion providers performed more than 1m abortions in the United States in 2024. About 155,000 people crossed state lines for abortions – roughly double the number of patients who did so in 2020, before the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for more than a dozen state-level abortion bans to take effect. These numbers, released earlier this week by the abortion rights-supporting Guttmacher Institute, have not changed much since 2023, when the US also performed more than 1m abortions and 169,000 people traveled for the procedure. This lack of change masks a deep geographical divide in the US, as a handful of states have now become major hubs for people seeking abortions. In 2024, Illinois provided roughly 35,000 abortions to out-of-state patients, while North Carolina provided 16,700. Kansas and New Mexico, which neighbor anti-abortion Texas, provided 16,100 and 12,800 abortions – the vast majority of which were to out-of-state patients. “Travel is so incredibly costly, both for patients and for the broader support network of funds, practical support organizations and providers,” said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a Guttmacher data scientist. The sheer magnitude of the travel, he said, is “testament to the great efforts that a lot of people are taking in order to make sure that people could access care that really they should be able to access within their own community – without necessarily expending this enormous financial and logistical cost”. As the Guttmacher report focuses on abortions provided through the formal healthcare system, it does not count self-managed abortions, which appear to be on the rise post-Roe. (Medical experts widely agree that individuals can safely end their own first-trimester pregnancies using abortion pills.) The report also does not track abortions provided to people living in states with total abortion bans, even though providers living in blue states sometimes mail abortion pills across state lines – a practice that, in recent months, has sparked heated litigation. This does not mean, researchers warned, that everybody who wants a post-Roe abortion is still able to get one. Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor who has researched the impact of abortion bans, estimated that about 20-25% of people who want abortions are blocked from getting them by bans. The Guttmacher report arrived days after the Trump administration effectively demolished the CDC team responsible for government reports on abortion provision in the United States, which are known as “abortion surveillance” reports. These cuts have alarmed researchers. “If we can’t measure outcomes, we can’t do science,” Myers said. “My concern is that this work fundamentally relies on the ability to track public health outcomes, and if we aren’t tracking them, we don’t know what’s happening to people. We don’t know what’s happening in their lives. We don’t know the effect of policies and interventions.” In addition to the CDC and Guttmacher, just one other group – #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning – regularly collects nationwide data on abortion incidence. The groups use different methods to collect data, so the CDC’s annual report on the topic has long been less comprehensive than the post-Roe reports issued by Guttmacher and #WeCount. A number of states – including California, a haven for abortion rights – do not provide information to the federal government about the abortions performed within their borders. The CDC report also lags behind the Guttmacher and #WeCount reports; its most recent report, issued in November, counted abortions performed in 2022. The CDC report does include information about abortion patients’ demographic backgrounds and the gestational age of their pregnancies, which can serve as a critical fact-check in heated debates around abortion. Anti-abortion activists, for example, often condemn abortions that take place later on in pregnancy, but the 2022 CDC report found that only about 1.1% of all abortions take place at or after 21 weeks’ gestation. “Abortion surveillance can be used to assess changes in clinical practice patterns over time,” a former employee from the CDC’s Division of Reproductive Health said in a text. “Without this report, we are losing the ability to track these changes.” Notably, the move to ax the researchers behind the CDC report appears to run counter to Project 2025, a famous playbook of conservative policies. Project 2025 urged the federal government to dramatically expand the CDC’s “abortion surveillance” by cutting funds to states that did not provide the CDC with information about “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”. It also suggested that the CDC collect statistics on miscarriages, stillbirths and “treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child (such as chemotherapy)”. These proposals alarmed researchers and raised concerns about patients’ data privacy, especially given the fact that abortion remains a deeply controversial procedure. But given the turbulence of the Trump administration, experts are not sure whether another agency will ultimately take up Project 2025’s recommendations. Maddow-Zimet said he doesn’t “think that we’re necessarily any less concerned than we were before about the possibility of these kind of data mandates going into effect and/or using the data in appropriate ways to either make providers ask patients questions they wouldn’t have otherwise asked, that are very stigmatizing, or potentially put providers at risk”.","2025-04-20T11:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/20/us-abortion-travel-report"
"abortion","New York clerk refuses to enforce Texas effort to punish abortion provider","A New York county clerk on Thursday refused to enforce a Texas court fineagainst a New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills across state lines – a move that tees up a dramatic showdown between states that protect abortion rights and those that have banned the procedure. The clash will probably end up in front of the US supreme court. In December, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued Dr Margaret Carpenter in a Texas court for allegedly mailing abortion pills to the Lone Star state, which bans virtually all abortions. After Carpenter did not show up to a court hearing earlier this year, a Texas judge ruled against her, ordering her to pay a $113,000 penalty and stop sending abortion pills to Texas. New York has, however, enacted a “shield law” that forbids state officials from extraditing abortion providers to other states or complying with out-of-state court orders. In his statement refusing to enforce the Texas fine, the acting Ulster county clerk Taylor Bruck cited the law. “In accordance with the New York State Shield Law, I have refused this filing and will refuse any similar filings that may come to our office. Since this decision is likely to result in further litigation, I must refrain from discussing specific details about the situation,” Bruck said in a statement. Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Texas may challenge New York’s shield law through a lawsuit. Although a number of blue states have passed shield laws since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, they have never been put to the legal test. The case will also probably serve as a bellwether for the future of interstate relations between anti-abortion states and pro-abortion rights states. In the years since Roe fell, anti-abortion activists have grown increasingly frustrated over people’s ability to travel across state lines for the procedure and to undergo medication abortions through telehealth. Alabama has threatened to prosecute people who help others travel for out-of-state abortions, while Louisiana has issued a criminal indictment against Carpenter for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill to someone in that state. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, refused Louisiana’s call for extradition. “I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana – not now, not ever,” she said last month. Carpenter has not publicly commented on the case. However, a group she co-founded, Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine Access, has accused Paxton of “putting women directly in harm’s way”. “Since Roe v Wade was overturned, we have seen attempts to further impede and erode a person’s right to make decisions about their own bodies,” the organization said in a statement after news of Paxton’s lawsuit against Carpenter broke. “Shield laws are essential in safeguarding and enabling abortion care regardless of a patient’s zip code or ability to pay. They are fundamental to ensuring everyone can access reproductive healthcare as a human right.”","2025-03-27T17:33:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/new-york-abortion-pill-lawsuit-texas-fine"
"abortion","Number of abortions in England and Wales hit record high in 2022","The number of abortions in England and Wales reached a record high in 2022, with a leading provider stating that women are facing “significant barriers” in access to contraception. Almost three in 10 conceptions ended in legal abortions in the two nations in 2022, up from about two in 10 a decade earlier, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The percentage of conceptions leading to legal abortion – which has been increasing for all age groups since 2015 – was 29.7% in 2022, up from 26.5% a year earlier and 20.8% in 2012. There were 247,703 conceptions leading to a legal abortion in 2022, a 13.1% rise on the 218,923 recorded in 2021. Separate government figures relating to 2022 that were published last year showed the number of abortions for women living in England and Wales had risen by almost a fifth in a year. There were 251,377 abortions for women resident in the two nations in 2022, according to figures from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which was the highest since the Abortion Act was introduced almost 60 years ago and a rise of 17% on the 2021 figure. Katherine O’Brien, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Services (Bpas), said women were struggling to access contraception as well as facing increasing financial pressures because of the cost of living crisis. “Women are facing significant barriers when trying to access contraception, including long wait times and difficulties securing appointments,” she said. “At Bpas, we regularly hear from women who are seeking an abortion after falling pregnant while waiting for repeat pill prescriptions or coil insertions.” A Bpas report last year found that 49% of women in the UK faced barriers to contraception, with long wait times posing a particular difficulty. O’Brien added that interest rate hikes and increases in the cost of living in 2022 might also have forced couples to make “sometimes tough decisions around continuing or ending a pregnancy”. “No woman should have to end a pregnancy she would otherwise have continued purely for financial reasons, and no woman should become pregnant because our healthcare system is failing to provide women with the contraception they want, when they need it,” she said. The ONS figures show that girls under 16 remained the age group with the highest percentage of conceptions leading to abortion, at 61.0%, while women aged between 30 and 34 years old had the lowest percentage of conceptions leading to abortion in 2022, at about a fifth, or 20.5%. Women in their early 30s were the age group with the highest number of conceptions, at 249,991. Women aged over 40 had a conception rate of 17.2 per 1,000 women in 2022, slightly below the record high of 17.3 per 1,000 women in 2021, according to the ONS. O’Brien called on the government to reclassify emergency contraception to enable it to be sold in more places. “Emergency contraception, while not a silver bullet to unplanned pregnancy rates, remains an underutilised resource in this country, with the majority of women not accessing this vital back-up method after an episode of unprotected sex,” she said. “The government has committed to improving access via pharmacies, but we need to see this medication reclassified so that it can be sold in a wider range of outlets, including supermarkets, so that women can access it as swiftly as possible when needed.”","2025-07-09T14:26:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/09/number-of-abortions-in-england-and-wales-hit-record-levels-in-2022"
"abortion","Abortion Dream Team review – dynamic study of activists resisting Poland’s near-total ban","Under Poland’s near-total abortion ban, a group of courageous activists step up for women’s autonomy. Deploying a fly-on-the-wall approach, Karolina Domagalska’s dynamic film closely follows the tireless efforts of Abortion Dream Team (ADT), an advocacy group founded in 2016. Forming a staunch resistance to oppressive legislation, they provide medical consultancy and assistance to tens of thousands of women who can no longer access abortion services legally. The hotline never stops ringing. Abandoned by the healthcare system, women from all over Poland reach out to the ADT volunteers, who guide them through these moments of uncertainty and confusion with extraordinary care. In addition to abortion pills and emergency contraceptives, the group also provides logistics support to those who need to travel to other countries for critical procedures. Every day comes not only with this flood of cries for help, but also an onslaught of threats and abuse from anti-abortion supporters. In one harrowing scene, the activists confront a group of policemen about a moving bus plastered with the faces of ADT associates, branding them as so-called murderers. The law, however, is not on their side. Justyna, one of their core members, was put on trial and convicted for distributing abortion pills. Shot in tight closeup, Domagalska’s documentary brilliantly conveys the unseen psychological toll of this social work. At the same time, the film overflows with the joy of activism. In their playful video campaigns, ADT members deliberately counter the stigmas surrounding abortion with spirited humour. In one scene that parodies Baywatch, the activists, dressed in all red, break into laughter as they sprint down a sandy beach. They, too, are on a mission to save lives, one phone call at a time. • Abortion Dream Team is on Viaplay from 21 April.","2025-04-14T12:00:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/14/abortion-dream-team-review-dynamic-study-of-polish-activists"
"abortion","Wyoming Republicans’ anti-abortion bill inadvertently targets chemotherapy and surgeries","In an effort to restrict abortion access, Wyoming Republicans authored a bill that could choke access to a host of life-saving medical procedures, from chemotherapy to heart surgery. State judge Melissa Owens overturned Wyoming’s abortion bans in November 2024, citing the state’s constitutionally guaranteed right to healthcare. The Republican state senator Cheri Steinmetz and the bill’s eight co-sponsors took issue with the ruling, and sought to draw up a definition of healthcare that excludes abortion. “The intent of [Senate File] 125 is to do no harm and go back to that Hippocratic oath and look at healthcare through that lens,” Steinmeitz told the Guardian. Steinmetz says Senate File 125 offers a new definition of healthcare in Wyoming: “No act, treatment or procedure that causes harm to the heart, respiratory system, central nervous system, brain, skeletal system, jointed or muscled appendages or organ function shall be construed as healthcare.” The bill carves out exceptions – for example, when such a procedure is required to save the life of a pregnant woman, or if “a person has no chance of meaningful recovery” without it. Fetal personhood is still on the books in Wyoming from 2023’s overturned “Life Is a Human Right Act”, but experts interviewed said that the murkiness of the bill’s language made it unclear if it would succeed at restricting abortion access – its intended purpose. But Wyoming attorneys and healthcare law professionals at Boston University, George Washington University, Johns Hopkins and Pittsburgh University, say the problem is that a broad swath of healthcare procedures can be considered to cause “harm” by design. “There’s a slew of medical procedures, surgeries, treatments that can have potentially positive outcomes but may also cause harm in the short period or as an unintended consequence,” the Wyoming attorney Abigail Fournier said. “It’s scary to me, because I think it could be interpreted to be very limiting in terms of what healthcare providers can do.” Wyoming’s constitutional right to healthcare stems from a 2012, voter-ratified constitutional amendment stating that “the right to make healthcare decisions is reserved to the citizens of the state of Wyoming”. Tom Lubnau, Wyoming attorney and former Republican speaker of the state house, helped author the amendment. He sees much of the current legislature as having “tunnel vision”, and a fixation on passing social issue legislation that ignores constitutionality. “Healthcare decisions are the individual’s in Wyoming. And that’s what the freedom amendment says,” Lubnau said. “Butt out of my decisions, and let me take care of myself.” Lubnau sits on one side of Wyoming’s gaping Republican divide, which pits an older class of more moderate, establishment Republicans against the state’s further-right Freedom Caucus, who, this past election cycle, became the first Freedom Caucus chapter to take control of a state house. The Freedom Caucus has wasted no time in pushing a mass of social issue bills that line up neatly with national conservative talking points. Among the focuses are dismantling DEI programming, strict definitions of gender, immigration restrictions and a glut of abortion restrictions. The Boston University healthcare law professor Nicole Huberfeld has seen plenty of crafty attempts to restrict abortion access, such as transvaginal ultrasound requirements, or laws mandating abortion clinics meet the licensing requirements of ambulatory surgical centers. But Huberfeld and other experts interviewed said that they had yet to encounter a bill looking to redefine healthcare entirely. Huberfeld will not be surprised if other states follow Wyoming’s lead, particularly those that have constitutional rights to healthcare. “If they don’t have bills like this, I expect that they will take a page from Wyoming’s book and try the same thing,” Huberfeld said. The George Washington University law professor Sonia Suter said the bill fit into a broader trend of taking away authority from medical professionals and putting it into the hands of politicians. “There’s a lot less faith in professional expertise, scientists, medicine,” Suter said. “Legislators are coming in and trying to pass laws that are less about healthcare and more about some kind of moral agenda, religious agenda. This is a way to sort of give the legislature more power.” When asked if any doctors or medical professionals were consulted in the authoring of the bill, Steinmetz said that she received the bill from an attorney, and was not sure who the attorney sourced input from. She said that the bills’ sponsors were aware of concerns about chemotherapy and other procedures – and that they would sort it out if the bill moved forward. “We have the best of intentions, and sometimes bills start out a little rockier than others,” Steinmetz said. Joanne Rosen, health law professor at Johns Hopkins University, is less worried with the intentions behind the bill, and more so with the effects of bills that seek to carve out abortion – and end up affecting less “controversial” forms of healthcare. “It has the effect of chilling physicians from administering medical treatment because they worry they may be in violation of the law. That’s a significant concern,” Rosen said. While attorneys interviewed confirmed that voter referendums are necessary to make changes to Wyoming’s constitution, Steinmetz said that the bill did not seek to change the constitution – just a definition. “Obviously it’s not spelled out in the constitution that abortion is healthcare, and so we can put limitations on that,” Steinmeitz said. Still, Clark Stith, Wyoming attorney and former Republican state speaker pro tempore, is not sold. “This bill, which purports to provide rules of construction of the Wyoming constitution, simply can’t do that,” Stith said. “A statute cannot change the meaning of words in the constitution. Period. End of story.” Stith also wondered why, if abortion is such a central priority, politicians put the abortion question in the hands of Wyoming’s voters. “Why aren’t you bringing it as a proposed constitutional amendment?” Stith asked. “Why aren’t you bringing it as a joining resolution to get placed on the ballot?”","2025-02-02T16:00:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/wyoming-republicans-anti-abortion-bill"
"abortion","US supreme court rejects anti-abortion challenges to clinic ‘buffer zones’","In a loss for abortion opponents, the US supreme court on Monday declined to take up two cases involving “buffer zone” ordinances, which limit protests around abortion clinics and which anti-abortion activists have spent years trying to dismantle. The two cases dealt with buffer zone ordinances passed by the cities of Carbondale, Illinois, and Englewood, New Jersey. In filings to the supreme court, which is dominated 6-3 by conservatives, anti-abortion activists argued that these ordinances ran afoul of the first amendment’s guarantees of free speech. They also asked the justices to overturn a 2000 ruling called Hill v Colorado, which upheld a buffer zone law in Colorado. The justices didn’t explain why they declined to hear arguments in the cases, but the far-right justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said they would have preferred to take them up. In a dissent outlining his desire to take the Carbondale case, Thomas wrote that he believed Hill “lacks continuing force”, in part due to recent rulings such as Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v Wade and abolished the federal right to abortion. “I would have taken this opportunity to explicitly overrule Hill,” he wrote. “Following our repudiation in Dobbs, I do not see what is left of Hill. Yet, lower courts continue to feel bound by it. The court today declines an invitation to set the record straight on Hill’s defunct status.” The Illinois case involved a 2023 ordinance that limited people from getting within 8ft of another individual if that individual is within 100ft of a healthcare facility, such as Carbondale’s multiple abortion clinics. In the wake of Roe’s demise, Carbondale’s clinics had become a haven for people fleeing the abortion bans that now blanket much of the US south and midwest. The anti-abortion group Coalition Life sued over the ordinance, vowing to keep up the court fight even after Carbondale repealed it. The “gamesmanship” over the ordinance, the group argued, only proved that “Hill will continue to distort both the first amendment and public debates about abortion unless and until it is overruled”. The New Jersey case, meanwhile, was brought by an anti-abortion protester named Jeryl Turco, who asked the justices to strike down a 2014 ordinance. That ordinance bans people from coming within 8ft of the entrances of certain healthcare facilities in Englewood – including abortion clinics – unless they are patients, employees or passersby. Abortion providers and their supporters have spent years defending the idea of buffer zones, pointing to the high rates of violence and harassment that occur in and around US abortion clinics. Over the last half-century, clinics have weathered more than 40 bombings, 200 arsons and 300 burglaries, according to the National Abortion Federation. Anti-abortion activists have also killed at least 11 people. Abortion clinics have also long relied on the protections of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or Face, a federal law that is meant to penalize people who vandalize reproductive health clinics or who threaten, obstruct or injure the individuals trying to enter those clinics. But after Donald Trump took office in January, his justice department vowed to significantly curtail investigations into alleged Face violations. Trump also pardoned several anti-abortion activists who had been recently convicted for violating Face. In the years since it overturned Roe, the supreme court has shown hesitation around newer abortion cases. In 2024, the justices rejected an attempt to limit access to mifepristone, a common abortion pill – but left the door open for a lower court to continue the case. The justices also punted on a case that questioned whether federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions. That case is also continuing in a lower court. Still, the supreme court is set to rule in at least one abortion case this term. In April, the high court will hear arguments in a case over whether South Carolina can cut the abortion provider Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid funding.","2025-02-24T18:44:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/supreme-court-abortion-buffer-zone"
"abortion","Groups helping Americans find abortion pills report Instagram ‘shadow-banning’","Over the last week, the accounts of some major organizations that help Americans find abortion pills had their Instagram posts censored or removed, and at least one group said its account became difficult to find through searching – a practice known as “shadow-banning”. Censorship of abortion-related content on social media is a longstanding issue. In the days and weeks after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, several abortion rights groups had their Instagram and TikTok posts removed or accounts suspended, while Instagram and Facebook deleted the posts of users who mentioned abortion pills. But the recent erasure and submerging of abortion-related content, so soon after Donald Trump’s return to power, has caused fear among some abortion rights supporters that a bigger crackdown could be on the horizon – and concerns that the Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s promise to protect “free expression” may not apply to all speech. “There’s been this narrative of first amendment rights and free speech and we hope that that applies to all forms of speech,” said Rebecca Davis, head of marketing at Hey Jane, a telehealth clinic that provides abortion pills, emergency contraception and birth control. Since last week, an Instagram search for the words “hey jane” will not surface the organization’s account. Instead, users can only find it if they type in the word “hey jane health” – the account’s full name. This, Davis said, constitutes a shadow ban. “For someone who’s not following us but is seeking out care, there’s really no way for them to be able to know that the only way to find us is to type ‘hey jane health’,” Davis said. “It really does limit people’s ability to find accurate information when they’re seeking out this very timely, essential healthcare.” On Friday, Instagram removed a Hey Jane post entitled “5 Abortion Facts You Need to Know in 2025”, alleging: “The post may buy, sell, or exchange drugs that require a prescription from a doctor or pharmacist,” in violation of the platform’s community guidelines. Hey Jane has been verified by LegitScript, which certifies online pharmacies. Meta can grant authorization to LegitScript-certified entities to run prescription drug ads. The New York Times, which reported on the changes to abortion-related content and accounts on Friday morning, said that two other organizations that help women access abortion pills, Just the Pill and Women Help Women, had their accounts restored. But, at least by Friday evening, the Women Help Women account was unavailable and was not restored until late on Monday night, according to a screenshot viewed by the Guardian. Jessica Valenti, author of a popular newsletter that tracks developments in abortion rights and restrictions, flagged last week that multiple posts from the organization Aid Access, which mails abortion pills, were blurred out. As of Tuesday, at least two pinned posts on the account remained partially obscured; while the captions were available, the images were blurred or removed entirely. In a post last week, the group said that its account had recently been suspended for more than a week. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company’s policies around the sale of pharmaceutical drugs had not changed. “We prohibit the sale of pharmaceutical drugs on our platforms without proper certification,” the spokesperson’s statement said. “These groups encountered both correct enforcement and a variety of issues, including overenforcement and a technical bug, that resulted in the blurring of some posts. But we’ve been quite clear in recent weeks that we want to allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes – and we’re committed to doing that.” The blurs on the Aid Access account were the result of a glitch, as those posts had been cross posted to Facebook and removed on that platform on the suspicion that they had violated Facebook’s policies, according to Meta. Some of those removed posts were restored after the company decided they did not, in fact, violate any policies. The Women Help Women account was suspended in error. The Hey Jane post, Meta said, was deleted because it did not meet the requirements for content around prescription drugs. Accounts and content may also not be “recommended” by Instagram’s algorithm – and thus harder to find through search – if they deals with pharmaceutical drugs or have recently violated Instagram’s guidelines. “Throughout the years, the process of getting the accounts back or just communicating with big tech has been harder,” said Martha Dimitratou, digital strategist for the group Plan C, which provides information about abortion pills, and a co-founder of Repro Uncensored, a coalition that works to protect access to information about abortion. Medical experts widely agree that, in the first trimester of pregnancy, it is safe to “self-manage” your own abortion using pills. Plan C’s Instagram account, Dimitratou estimated, had been taken down “six, seven times at least”. “There’s not at all institutional memory or understanding that this is something that keeps happening to this account,” she said. “Every time we have a new instance of censorship, we have to prove that we are a non-profit. We have to go again from square one.” Abortion-related content is often taken down when the procedure is in the headlines, said Jane Eklund, lead researcher with Repro Uncensored. The organizations that post the content are frequently told they are violating platforms’ regulations around selling or providing goods online – even when their accounts have nothing to do with selling or providing abortion pills, according to Eklund, who worked on a 2024 Amnesty International report about the removal of online info about abortion. “So many organizations are left in the dark. They would do what they need to do to avoid having their content taken down if they actually knew what that is,” Eklund continued. “They just don’t really have that transparency from the platform.” This story has been updated to reflect comments from Meta","2025-01-29T22:15:19Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/abortion-pills-instagram-shadow-banning"
"abortion","Queensland parliament passes ‘unprecedented’ gag on abortion debate","The Queensland parliament has been banned from debate on abortion for four years after an ambush motion by the premier, David Crisafulli, in a move labelled “unprecedented”. The motion also requires any “motion or amendment” seeking to have the house “express its views” on abortion be ruled out of order. Opposition and crossbench MPs labelled the move “extraordinary” and “unprecedented”. There was no notice of the move before Crisafulli introduced the motion into the parliament after question time. Just half an hour was set aside for debate before he used the Liberal National party’s majority to ram it through. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The issue dominated the recent Queensland election campaign, with Labor repeatedly warning the LNP would roll back their historic 2018 legalisation legalising the procedure for the first time. Crisafulli said his motion ended a “disgraceful … US-style scare campaign”. “I said from day one, it was not part of our plan,” Crisafulli said. “I said there will be no changes. And despite that – Labor knew this – and despite that, the social media tsunami, the grubby phone calls continued unabated. They spent millions of dollars on a disgraceful scare campaign.” Crisafulli failed to rule out a conscience vote on the issue, despite being asked dozens of times to do so. Many of his MPs have confirmed they are anti-abortion. The opposition leader, Steven Miles, said the move was “extraordinary”. “Mr Speaker, these are extraordinary scenes. I thought I’d never seen anything as extraordinary as what they did at the last sitting. But this, with no notice, no discussion, no advice to the media that it was even coming, such a grubby, grubby treatment [of a serious issue].” Several Labor MPs pointed out that the motion prevented the parliament from expanding legislative protections for abortion services. “If there is further developments by the TGA to further strengthen scope of practice for health professionals, to make it easier for women, this house could not debate that issue,” Labor MP Shannon Fentiman said. “If women need more protection from attending abortion clinics, those reforms would not be possible. “This is appalling, it is unprecedented and they should be ashamed for being so obviously, so obviously against women’s rights in this state that they have to gag their own members for four years. Shame.” Crossbench MP Robbie Katter has repeatedly vowed to reintroduce the party’s “babies born alive” bill, which regulated abortion providers, a move that would almost certainly have forced a vote on the issue. It has been a longstanding practice of the LNP party room to grant MPs a conscience vote – allowing them to vote freely without influence of the party – on matters of life or death. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, KAP MPs warned that it was the “death of democracy”. “I think Queenslanders today should be mourning the death of democracy here in the Queensland parliament,” KAP MP Nick Dametto said. UQ law professor Graeme Orr said the motion lawfully amended parliament’s sessional orders for the term of the parliament. “But this is quite odd. Only two weeks back, the government asked parliament to adopt the sessional orders for this term,” he said. “It tells Queensland the intention is to brook no debate about changing the Termination of Pregnancy Act.” Orr said the law was “a bit silly” because it would have to be undone if there was a genuine need to amend the act due to unforseen necessity. All 50 LNP MPs present voted for the motion, with 35 Labor MPs and three Katter’s Australia party MPs voting against it.","2024-12-10T03:48:32Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/queensland-parliament-passes-unprecedented-gag-on-abortion-debate"
"abortion","British women are being jailed under archaic abortion laws. MPs can act to end that this week","You might have seen their faces. Every few months nowadays, another woman appears in a British newspaper charged with a suspected illegal abortion. Often the woman looks pale and gaunt. Sometimes she hides behind sunglasses as she bows her head. The photographs of these women walking into court feel akin to a public shaming, where the stocks are replaced by a breaking news banner, but the judgment remains the same. If this sounds like a punishment from a different time, it’s because it is. The law that’s largely used to prosecute women for a suspected illegal abortion was written in 1861 – that’s before women had the right to vote or own property independently. While the Abortion Act in 1967 gave widespread access to abortion, it was never made fully legal on the statute books. Now that may change. After more than a century and a half, this week could see abortion decriminalised in England and Wales – and for the first time, give tens of millions of women a genuine right to choose. When the crime and policing bill returns to the Commons, a Labour backbencher, Tonia Antoniazzi, will table an amendment to remove women from the criminal law. It would finally get rid of the anachronistic stain on otherwise modern abortion rights: women will no longer face prosecution if they end a pregnancy after 24 weeks or without approval from two doctors. There is some uncertainty. For one, a second amendment is being put forward by Stella Creasy that aims to enshrine access to abortion as a human right, and pro-choice charities fear would disrupt services. Although it has less support, it could also be selected for a vote. But parliamentary debate aside, reform is highly likely to be on the way. Antoniazzi’s amendment has already received the backing of more than 130 MPs, according to the Times, and senior government figures expect it to pass with a large majority. The urge for decriminalisation has increased as the risk of arrest has. It is estimated that more than 100 women have been prosecuted for a suspected abortion over the last decade. And the number of court cases and convictions has actually increased in the 21st century. Between 1861 and 2022, only three women in Great Britain were convicted of an illegal abortion. Since December 2022 alone, seven women have been charged. One woman has been jailed. There is no clear reason as to why. When I asked the British Pregnancy Advisory Service – the leading abortion provider – about the spike in prosecutions, it pointed to an “inherent suspicion of women in certain circumstances”, combined with an increased awareness of abortion medicine by medical professionals, who then breach their duty of confidentiality, and police. Earlier this year, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), which sets the strategic direction for policing across the UK, quietly issued guidance on how to search women’s homes for abortion drugs as well as seize their phones to inspect menstrual cycle tracker apps. The cases that have already made it to court – and the papers – have been deeply disturbing. Last month, Nicola Packer was acquitted of unlawfully taking abortion pills at home after the legal time limit during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020. Arrested in hospital by uniformed officers while still recovering from surgery for a stillbirth, it took Packer more than four years to clear her name. During her trial, prosecutors picked over her “alternative” sex life and the size of her nipples. And yet this is also about the women whose names don’t make the headlines. Campaigners say women are routinely put under a police investigation that comes to nothing – the majority of them have in fact naturally given birth prematurely or had stillbirths. There have been cases of women denied contact with their children while police investigated a charge that was later dropped. One teenager who had a late miscarriage was arrested in front of her entire street. The small number of women and girls who have had an abortion past the legal cut-off point are often deeply vulnerable, and include victims of trafficking or domestic violence. As BPAS told me: “We’re aware of cases where the woman has been investigated, or even imprisoned, and nothing has happened to her abusive partner.” Where is the public interest in any of this? Pregnancy loss – particularly late term – is still equated with guilt and failure. To lose a pregnancy and then be called in by the police and questioned under caution, let alone taken to court, is less criminal justice and more a kind of state-sponsored humiliation. It does not feel like a coincidence that the rise in prosecutions has come as abortion rights in the UK – from decriminalisation in Northern Ireland to the permanent adoption of telemedicine after lockdown – have made gains. Progress always comes with pushback. The rapid rise of Reform UK shows how, even in the most liberal of societies, the threat to women and minority rights is never truly over. Nigel Farage has already floated tougher restrictions on abortion as well as tax breaks for married couples. We need only look to the global shift to authoritarianism to see the extreme end-point of this. When police searched the car of the man suspected of killing a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota, US, on Saturday, they allegedly found a list of people with links to abortion rights. Decriminalising abortion will, in the short term, save a handful of women from the trauma of a courtroom, and a hundred or so more from a police cell. That matters. But it will also do something else of value: it will say no woman should be forced to continue a pregnancy against her will, and that abortion is healthcare, not a criminal offence. As we finally edge close to change, it is surely time to shift the stigma – it is not women who should feel shame but the MPs and prosecutors who let this barbarism go on.

Here are some of the top moments of the day: Donald Trump has arrived in Los Angeles and was greeted by Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump was accompanied by the first lady and held an impromptu press conference as soon as he stepped off the plane. Trump said that he would waive federal permits so people who lost their homes in the Los Angeles wildfires could begin to rebuild as soon as possible. Trump said this on Friday after a tour of the fire-ravaged Palisades community. Mexico denied a military plane carrying people who were deported from the US access to land in the country on Thursday, NBC News has reported. While aboard Air Force One en route to tour the devastation from the wildfires in Los Angeles, Trump signed two executive orders targeting abortions. The first would reinstate the Mexico City policy, which prevents international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving federal funding. The second was an order affirming a longstanding federal policy that the US does not use federal funds to pay for abortions. The justice department chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, has issued an order to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking reproductive rights facilities.In a memo on Friday, Mizelle wrote that prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act will now be permitted only in “extraordinary circumstances” or in cases presenting ”significant aggravating factors”, AP reports. Donald Trump has suggested paring back or even dismantling the federal response to major disasters, a move that would cut off aid that has largely helped support Republican-leaning states that voted for him in last year’s US presidential election. Thanks for reading. Have a good weekend. Donald Trump said that he would waive federal permits so people who lost their homes in the Los Angeles wildfires could begin to rebuild as soon as possible. Trump said this on Friday after a tour of the fire-ravaged Palisades community. “I’d ask that the local permitting process be the same. Some of the people were saying they’ll be forced to wait 18 months for their permits …I’m sure you can get it down to not even 18 days,” Trump said as he sat at a table with LA mayor Karen Bass during a roundtable briefing. This announcement followed the announcement of a $2.5bn aid package signed by Gavin Newsom on Thursday that is meant to expedite the cleanup, inspection and permitting processes so that residents affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. Mexico denied a military plane carrying people who were deported from the US access to land in the country on Thursday, NBC News reported on Friday. According to the outlet: It was not immediately clear why Mexico blocked the flight, but tensions between the US and Mexico, neighbors and longtime allies, have risen since Donald Trump won the November election. Trump has threatened to slap 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico in retaliation for migrants crossing the border the countries share. But he has not yet put them in effect. Issues between the Trump administration and Mexico have been high since the president’s first administration and these tensions have only grown, with Trump and his allies blaming Mexican and Central American migrants for crime in the US and have vowed to ramp up deportations. Read the entirety of the NBC News report on the rejected flights here. While aboard Air Force One en route to tour the devastation from the wildfires in Los Angeles, Donald Trump signed two executive orders targeting abortions. The first would reinstate the Mexico City policy, which prevents international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving federal funding. This policy, which abortion rights supporters call the “global gag rule”, dates back to the 1980s and is typically implemented whenever Republicans take control of the White House. The second was an order affirming a longstanding federal policy that the US does not use federal funds to pay for abortions. The actions come just after he addressed a crowd of thousands of abortion opponents in Washington on Friday to mark the 52nd anniversary of the supreme court’s 1973 decision in Roe v Wade. The decision created a national right to abortion but was overturned by the court in 2022. The Los Angeles county medical examiner has identified 18 of the 28 people who died in the still-burning Eaton and Palisades fire, the medical examiner’s office announced on Friday. The deceased people whose names have been released range in age from their late 50s to early 90s. Most died in their homes from smoke inhalation and “thermal injuries”. These names were released as Donald Trump visited the area to tour the fire-ravaged neighborhoods where the deaths occurred. The names of those who died can be found here. Trump is taking an aerial tour of the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles to see the devastation from the Palisades fire. The Palisades fire, which began on 7 January and has killed at least 11 people, has burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed nearly 7,000 structures so far. That blaze is still not completely contained. Donald Trump has arrived in Los Angeles and was greeted by Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump was accompanied by the first lady and held an impromptu press conference as soon as he stepped off the plane. “We’re going to do a lot of work and I think you’re going to see a lot of progress,” Trump said, referring to the damage from the wildfires. Newsom asked for Trump’s support in the recovery effort and emphasized, “It’s not just the folks in Palisades but the folks in Altadena that were devastated.” Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Donald Trump said he would consider signing an executive order to “fundamentally reform” or potentially eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Trump, during a visit to Asheville, criticized the agency’s disaster response during a tour of hurricane-damaged areas in western North Carolina. He proposed giving governors more direct responsibility for disaster response, indicating he wants to redirect federal funding straight to states rather than through the federal agency. The Senate will vote tonight on the nomination of Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s controversial pick for US secretary of defense. Hegseth, a former Fox News host and army veteran, cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday but two Senate Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted against his nomination amid mounting concerns over his personal history and inexperience. The state department ordered a sweeping freeze on almost all US foreign aid programs, making exceptions for only aid to Israel and humanitarian food crises. The exceptions did not include life-saving health programs, such as clinics and immunization programs. Suspending funding “could have life or death consequences” for children and families around the world, Oxfam warned. The interior department said it has officially changed the change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Alaska’s mountain Denali, the highest peak in North America, has officially been renamed Mount McKinley – the name it was called before Barack Obama changed it in 2015, the department said in a statement. The Trump administration issued a new round of heavy-handed measures that could rapidly deport immigrants who entered the US through recently established legal pathways, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo obtained the New York Times. In no waste of time, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, posted on X on Friday that “Deportation flights have begun” with official pictures of people boarding a military-style aircraft. A federal judge banned Stewart Rhodes, the former leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group, and some other January 6 defendants from entering Washington DC, as well as the US Capitol, as a condition of their release from prison. The acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, intervened on behalf of Rhodes and other members of the militia group, asking US district court judge Amit Mehta to reverse the ban. Rhodes was among 1,500 controversially given blanket pardons or commutations by Trump soon after he was sworn in on Monday. Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, indicated that the justice department would no longer prosecute anti-abortion activists in separate addresses to the March for Life rally. “No longer will our government throw pro-life protesters and activists – elderly, grandparents, or anybody else – in prison,” Vance told the thousands-strong crowd that gathered on the National Mall, which included members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front. Meanwhile, the justice department’s chief of staff issued an order to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking reproductive rights facilities. The supreme court has agreed to consider whether the country’s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma. The case, led by two Catholic dioceses, could open the door to allowing public funds to directly flow to religious schools and transform the line between church and state in education. Trump held a call with the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, last week in which he insisted he was serious in his determination to take over Greenland, according to a Financial Times report. The call was described by senior European officials as “fiery” with Trump being aggressive and confrontational. Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said his country had agreed to discuss the question of Greenland after his first call with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Friday. Marco Rubio also spoke with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Friday in the first publicly disclosed contact between an official in the second Trump administration and a Chinese counterpart. A US readout of the call said Rubio “emphasized that the Trump Administration will pursue a US-PRC relationship that advances US interests and puts the American people first.” A Chinese readout said the two also discussed Taiwan, with Wang reportedly telling Rubio that Beijing will never allow Taiwan to be separated from mainland China. The Trump administration withdrew a Biden administration proposal to ban menthol cigarettes in the US, according to a filing by the office of information and regulatory affairs. Menthol cigarettes have also faced scrutiny for their disproportionate impact on the health of Black communities, and for their role in luring young people to smoking. Trump said he had pulled federal security protection for the former top US health official Anthony Fauci, who served as the nation’s top infectious disease official during the Covid-19 pandemic and had served seven US presidents. Trump said he would “certainly not take responsibility” if something was to happen to Fauci or John Bolton, his former national security adviser whose security detail he has also terminated. The supreme court has agreed to consider whether the country’s first publicly funded religious charter school should be allowed to open in Oklahoma. The case, led by two Catholic dioceses, could open the door to allowing public funds to directly flow to religious schools and transform the line between church and state in education. A lower court blocked the establishment of St Isidore of Seville Catholic virtual school, ruling that its funding arrangement violated the constitution’s first amendment limits on government endorsement of religion. The online school had planned to start classes for its first enrollees last fall, with part of its mission to evangelize its students in the Catholic faith. Charter schools in Oklahoma are considered public schools under state law and draw funding from the state government. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself from the case but did not explain why. Donald Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the Gulf of America and Alaska’s Mount Denali as Mount McKinley on Monday, something he promised earlier this month at a press conference. In his inaugural address on Monday, Trump said the former Republican president William McKinley “made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent – he was a natural businessman”. While Trump can direct the US geological survey to change how it denotes the Gulf of Mexico, such a name change would be unlikely to be recognized internationally. The Trump administration’s interior department said it has officially changed the change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Alaska’s mountain Denali, the highest peak in North America, has officially been renamed Mount McKinley – the name it was called before Barack Obama changed it in 2015, the department said in a statement. Donald Trump, on his first day in office on Monday, signed an order to rename the 617,800 sq mile Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s 20,000ft mountain Denali. The interior department said: In accordance with President Donald J Trump’s recent executive order, the Department of the Interior is proud to announce the implementation of name restorations that honor the legacy of American greatness, with efforts already under way. As directed by the president, the Gulf of Mexico will now officially be known as the Gulf of America and North America’s highest peak will once again bear the name Mount McKinley. The justice department chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, has issued an order to curtail prosecutions against people accused of blocking reproductive rights facilities. In a memo on Friday, Mizelle wrote that prosecutions and civil actions under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act will now be permitted only in “extraordinary circumstances” or in cases presenting ”significant aggravating factors”, AP reports. He said: President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of ending the weaponization of the federal government and has recently directed all federal departments and agencies to identify and correct the past weaponization of law enforcement. Mizelle also ordered the immediate dismissal of three civil Face Act cases related to blockades of clinics in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Ohio. It comes a day after Trump announced he would pardon anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinic entrances. Donald Trump’s pledge to rename the highest mountain in North America has sparked backlash among some Indigenous Alaskans and Alaskan lawmakers, including Republicans. Trump reiterated his intentions to rename Denali back to Mount McKinley during his inaugural address. Barack Obama had dubbed the mountain Denali during his presidency, undoing the 1917 designation made in honor of the 25th president, William McKinley. The declaration of renaming has proved to be highly controversial. The Koyukon, an Alaska Indigenous Athabascan group, referred to the mountain as Denali for centuries before McKinley took office or Alaska became a US state. Alaska News Source reported research that suggested that Alaskans are against changing the name back to McKinley by about a two-to-one margin, despite Alaska being a state that is overwhelmingly supportive of Republicans. Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday to create a taskforce to review the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and recommend changes, according to a report. The order establishes a group called the Fema Review Council, Semafor reports, who will be directed to issue a report on how the federal disaster response agency currently functions and ultimately recommend changes, including reorganizing or getting rid of the agency altogether. Trump, in comments earlier today, said he would consider signing an executive order to “fundamentally reform” or potentially eliminate Fema, calling the agency “not good” and a “disaster”. “I think we’re going to recommend that Fema go away,” the president told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina. The acting secretary of homeland security, Benjamine Huffman, has invoked a seldom-used provision of federal law to make it easier to deputize state and local police to carry out immigration enforcement, Reuters reports. In a memo seen by Reuters, Huffman, who took over leadership of the department after Donald Trump was inaugurated, cited a “mass influx” of migrants to the United States, though aspects of his order remains unclear. Enforcement of immigration law is the job of the federal government, though some Republican-led states have passed laws to allow state and local police to check the paperwork of suspected undocumented migrants. Acting US attorney for Washington DC Ed Martin has released a statement comparing Donald Trump’s commutations of the Oath Keeper’s militia members’ sentences to Joe Biden’s last-minute pardons of his family members Trump’s political enemies. “If a judge decided that Jim Biden, General Mark Milley, or another individual were forbidden to visit America’s capital-even after receiving a last-minute, preemptive pardon from the former President – I believe most Americans would object. The individuals referenced in our motion have had their sentences commuted – period, end of sentence,” Martin said in a statement obtained by Politico. Martin has argued against a judge’s order that prevents several members of the militia, including founder Stewart Rhodes from being in Washington DC or the Capitol building. The state department has ordered a halt to funding for almost all aid programs, citing an executive order Donald Trump signed on Monday, the Associated Press reports. Only aid to Israel and humanitarian food crises are excluded under the policy, with all other US aid programs told to keep running only until they exhaust the funding they currently have. Here’s more, from the AP: The sweeping order threatened a quick halt to countless projects globally aiding health, education, development, job training and other efforts by the United States, the largest provider of foreign aid. It appears to begin enforcement of a pledge to eliminate aid programs that President Donald Trump judges not to be in U.S. interests. The order — sent in a cable to U.S. embassies worldwide and obtained by The Associated Press — prohibits new government spending, which appears to limit programs to running only as long as they have cash on hand. Some leading aid organizations on Friday were interpreting the directive as an immediate stop-work order for U.S.-funded aid work globally, a senior aid organization official said. Many would likely cease operations immediately so as not to incur more costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Acting US attorney for Washington DC Ed Martin has intervened on behalf of Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and other members of the militia group, Politico reports. In a just-filed motion, Martin asked federal judge Amit Mehta to reverse a ban he imposed on the militia members that prevents them from entering the US Capitol or Washington DC. Martin argues that Donald Trump’s commutation of the group’s sentences preclude any such ban from being enforced, according to a filing. We’ll see how Mehta responds. This post has been corrected to note that Martin is the acting US attorney for Washington DC, not the acting attorney general. Another reason for Donald Trump to be cautious when it comes to unraveling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema): his Republican predecessor George W Bush’s experience with the botched response to Hurricane Katrina. The storm 20 years ago inundated New Orleans in one of the worst natural disasters of its time, and Bush’s administration was widely seen as botching the federal response. His administration’s Fema chief, Michael Brown, wound up being relieved of his role coordinating the response to the disaster and later resigned. The storm struck just less a year after Bush had won a second term in the 2004 election, and majorities in both houses of Congress. Coupled with dissatisfaction over Bush’s handling of the Iraq war, voters handed control of Congress back to the Democrats in the 2006 midterms – exactly the sort of scenario Trump would surely like to avoid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is the latest part of the federal government in Donald Trump’s crosshairs. But as the Guardian’s Oliver Milman and Dharna Noor report, the president may want to tread carefully: Donald Trump has suggested paring back or even dismantling the federal response to major disasters, a move that would cut off aid that has largely helped support Republican-leaning states that voted for him in last year’s US presidential election. Trump said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had “not done their job for the last four years” and that there would be “a whole big discussion very shortly, because I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems”. In an interview with Fox News, the US president said of Fema that “all it does is complicate everything” and that even states who resoundingly backed him, such as Oklahoma, should be primarily left to deal with the aftermath of major storms, floods and fires. “I love Oklahoma, but you know what? If they get hit with a tornado or something, let Oklahoma fix it,” Trump said. “And then the federal government can help them out with the money. Fema is getting in the way of everything.” Shifting the burden of disaster aid to the states, an idea outlined by the rightwing Project 2025 manifesto before the election, would hit Republican-leaning states hardest, federal spending figures suggest. Donald Trump said he was “proud to be a participant” in the overturning of Roe v Wade as he addressed anti-abortion activists at the March for Life rally in Washington DC. Trump, in a prerecorded video address, said he would “again stand proudly for families and for life” in his second term. “Six courageous justices of the Supreme Court of the United States returned the issue to the state legislatures and to the people where it belongs,” he said. Also addressing the crowds on Friday vice-president JD Vance said Trump had “delivered on his promise of ending Roe”, describing him as the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifetimes”. “America is fundamentally a pro-baby, a pro-family and a pro-life country,” Vance added. In their speeches to the March for Life on Friday, the largest anti-abortion gathering in the US, Donald Trump and vice-president JD Vance avoided making sweeping policy announcements about limiting access to abortion. However, both men indicated that the Department of Justice would no longer enforce the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or the Face Act, against anti-abortion protests. That law, passed in the 1990s amid a spate of high-profile anti-abortion violence, penalizes individuals who threaten, obstruct or injure someone who is trying to access a reproductive health clinic, or who vandalize a clinic. Anti-abortion activists, Vance told a roaring crowd, “should never have the government go after them again.” On Thursday, Trump pardoned a number of anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading a clinic in defiance of the Face Act. Those convictions had fueled demands by activists to repeal the act entirely. Vance and Trump – who spoke remotely, via a recorded message – garnered the biggest cheers by far from the thousands of people who rallied on the National Mall. Although Trump repeatedly flip-flopped on abortion rights during the 2024 campaign, angering the anti-abortion leaders who supported him during his first time, the movement’s enthusiasm for the new president was clearly undiminished. We reported earlier that Denmark has agreed to discuss the question of Greenland with Washington, according to Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen after his first call with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Trump also spoke to the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, last week in which he insisted he was serious in his determination to take over Greenland, the Financial Times reports. Trump spoke to Frederiksen for about 45 minutes in a call that was described as “fiery”, the paper writes, citing senior European officials. The conversation between the two went very badly, the officials said, adding that Trump had been aggressive and confrontational. “It was horrendous,” a source told FT. One person said the Danes “are utterly freaked out” by Trump’s call with Frederiksen. Another told the paper: The intent was very clear. They want it. The Danes are now in crisis mode. A spokesperson for Frederiksen told the FT they did “not recognize the interpretation of the conversation given by anonymous sources”. The Trump administration has withdrawn a Biden administration proposal to ban menthol cigarettes in the US, according to a filing by the office of information and regulatory affairs. The Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on the sale of flavored cigars and menthol cigarettes in 2022 after several health advocacy groups said they were highly addictive, and played a role in luring young people to smoking. Menthol cigarettes have also faced scrutiny for their disproportionate impact on the health of Black communities, Reuters reports. The news agency quotes Yolonda Richardson, CEO of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, as saying: It is deeply disappointing that a final rule was not issued in a timely manner. ... it is more critical than ever that states and cities step up their efforts to end the sale of menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products. Susie Wiles, Donald Trump’s chief of staff, has denied Elon Musk a permanent office in the West Wing of the White House, according to a Times report. Wiles, whose role as gatekeeper to the president wields great influence, has made it clear that she does not welcome “people who want to work solo or be a star”, the paper writes. Musk, who has been put in charge of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), had been angling for his own office within yards of the Oval Office, it says. But his senior leadership team will be based in the Eisenhower executive office building, which is in the White House grounds but a short walk away from the main complex, it says. Asked if Musk would be getting an office in the West Wing, Trump said earlier this week: “No. He’s getting an office for about 20 people that we’re hiring to make sure that these [savings] get implemented.” Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen agreed with his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, to discuss the question of Greenland at a later time, the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement. The two spoke for 20 minutes on Friday, discussing Ukraine, European security, and the Middle East. The statement in Danish said that while “Arctic security was not on the agenda,” the two agreed it would be discussed on another occasion, and Greenland would also be involved in talks. Denmark has been on high alert about the US administration’s intentions towards Greenland since Donald Trump’s comments suggesting he would want to take control over the territory. Earlier this week, he again said it was “a wonderful place,” that the US “needs for international security”. Members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front have gathered in Washington DC for the annual anti-abortion March for Life rally. A white supremacist and neo-fascist hate group, Patriot Front emerged as a rebrand of the neo-Nazi organization Vanguard America in the aftermath of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the SPLC, the Patriot Front “represents one of the most prominent white supremacist groups in the country”. A slew of big-name conservative men are addressing March for Life, the largest anti-abortion rally in the US. Senate majority leader John Thune, House speaker Mike Johnson and Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, are all amping up the thousands of marchers who gathered on the National Mall on Friday. But the name to get the biggest cheers so far belongs to a man who isn’t there: Donald Trump. “It is a new golden age in America, now we have President Donald J Trump back in the White House —“ Johnson started to say, only to be interrupted by rapturous cheers from the crowd. Johnson praised Trump for pardoning and freeing anti-abortion activists who were convicted of illegally blockading clinics. He also flagged one of Trump’s new executive orders, which declares that there are only two genders and incorporates the language of fetal personhood, a legal doctrine that holds that embryos and fetuses deserve full legal rights and protections. “I don’t know if you saw his executive order — it defines life as beginning at conception rather than birth,” Johnson said, to immense cheers. Friday marks the first time that both the US Senate majority leader and the House speaker have spoken to the March, which has gathered annually for more than 50 years. Vice-president JD Vance is expected to address the crowd in person, while Trump is set to deliver a video message. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Friday in the first publicly disclosed contact between an official in the second Trump administration and a Chinese counterpart. Wang told Rubio that Beijing and Washington should implement the “important consensus” reached between the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Donald Trump, according to a readout of the call by the Chinese foreign ministry. “I hope you would conduct yourself well and play a constructive role in the future of the Chinese and American people and in world peace and stability,” Wang reportedly told Rubio. Wang also said that China has “no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development,” the Chinese ministry said. The two also discussed Taiwan, it said. Wang reiterated that Beijing will never allow Taiwan to be separated from mainland China, and warned the US to handle related matters carefully, the ministry said. The Trump administration is issuing a new round of heavy-handed measures that could rapidly deport immigrants who entered the US through recently established legal pathways, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo obtained the New York Times. The directive, signed by the acting homeland security secretary Benjamine Huffman, grants Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials unprecedented authority to expedite deportations for immigrants who entered the country with government authorization through two key Biden-era programs. The newly reported memo instructs Ice officials to identify and potentially deport immigrants who have been in the country for over a year and have not yet applied for asylum, in effect sidestepping traditional immigration court proceedings. In no waste of time, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, posted on X on Friday that “Deportation flights have begun” with official pictures of people boarding a military-style aircraft. Dr Anthony Fauci did not have Secret Service protection, but his security detail – which Donald Trump ended last night – was being provided and paid for by the National Institutes of Health, CNN reports. Fauci, who served as the nation’s top infectious disease official, has continued to face ongoing threats due to his role during the Covid-19 pandemic. He has previously spoken about the need for round-the-clock security protection after receiving “credible death threats” that included his wife and daughters. In 2022, a West Virgina man was sentenced to prison for sending emails threatening Fauci and his family would be “dragged into the street, beaten to death, and set on fire”. The Republican senator Rand Paul had publicly called for Fauci’s security detail to be terminated. In a post on X on Thursday, Paul wrote: Today I sent supporting information to end the 24 hr a day limo and security detail for Fauci. I wish him nothing but peace but he needs to pay for his own limos. Trump, taking questions from reporters in Asheville, was asked about reports that he terminated Dr Anthony Fauci’s security detail last night. “When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off. You can’t have it forever,” Trump replied. Asked if he would feel responsible if something was to happen to Fauci or John Bolton, his former national security adviser whose security detail he also ended earlier this week, Trump said: No. They all made a lot of money. They can hire their own security too … I can give them some good numbers of very good security people. “Certainly I would not take responsibility,” he added. Donald Trump said he will sign an executive order to begin the process of “fundamentally reforming and overhauling” or “maybe getting rid of” the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). “I think, frankly, that Fema is not good,” Trump told reporters in Asheville, North Carolina. I think when you have a problem like this, I think you want to use your state to fix it and not waste time calling Fema … I think we’re going to recommend that Fema go away. He went on describe Fema as a “big disappointment”. “They cost a tremendous amount of money. It’s very bureaucratic, and it’s very slow,” he said. Donald Trump has terminated security detail for Dr Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, CNN reports. Fauci had his security protections revoked on Thursday night, the outlet writes, citing a source. He has since hired his own private security that he will have to pay for himself, it says. Since returning to the White House, Trump has ended security details for several of his former administration officials, including his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, former top aide Brian Hook, and John Bolton, his former national security adviser. Donald Trump reiterated his call for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to cut oil prices, claiming that it would help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, Trump said: We want to see Opec cut the price of oil, and that will automatically stop the tragedy that’s taking place in Ukraine. It’s a butchering tragedy for both sides. Trump made similar comments during an online address to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, where he called on Opec to cut the cost of oil, in order to choke off revenues to Russia and halt the conflict in Ukraine. Trump, speaking to reporters in Asheville, North Carolina, also said he wanted to secure two things from California in exchange for wildfire aid: voter identification laws and changes to water policy in the wake of the wildfires. I want to see two things in Los Angeles. Voter ID, so that the people have a chance to vote, and I want to see the water be released and come down into Los Angeles and throughout the state. “After that, I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen,” he said. Trump has repeatedly claimed falsely that the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and other officials have refused to provide water from the northern part of the state to fight the fires. Donald Trump said he would like to see states take care of disasters themselves as he made his first presidential trip of his second administration to hurricane-battered North Carolina on Friday. Trump, speaking to reporters, accused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) of having “really let the country down” as he prepared to meet with emergency responders and tour the “massive amount of damage” left by Hurricane Helene. He said: I like the concept [of] when North Carolina gets hit, the governor takes care of it. When Florida gets hit, the governor takes care of it. Meaning the states take care of it. He continued: I’d like to see states take care of disasters, let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen. Asked if he expected to ask Congress for additional aid for North Carolina and California, Trump claimed that the aid will go through his administration instead of Fema. The aid will go through us. So rather than going through Fema, it will go through us. In his first interview after his release from prison, Enrique Tarrio thanked Donald Trump for pardoning him for his role in planning the January 6 riot, saying he “literally gave me my life back”. Now that he is out, the Proud Boys leader wants revenge, he told Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist host of Info Wars. He said: The people who did this, they need to feel the heat, they need to be put behind bars, and they need to be prosecuted. “Success is going to be retribution,” he added. “We gotta do everything in our power to make sure that the next four years sets us up for the next 100 years.” In the days since the leaders of far-right militia groups were freed from prison, they and their organizations are regrouping and figuring out how to build back momentum now that Trump is back in office. They are emboldened by the mass pardons for the insurrectionists and are planning their next moves. A federal judge has barred the former leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group, Stewart Rhodes, and several other January 6 defendants from going into Washington DC or the US Capitol without the court’s approval. US district judge Amit Mehta issued the order after Rhodes visited the Capitol on Wednesday, a day after he was released from prison as part of Donald Trump’s sweeping clemency order. Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the attack on the Capitol and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The judge’s order today also applies to other members of the Oath Keepers group who were convicted of charges that they participated in a violent plot to attack the Capitol. Donald Trump is heading to Los Angeles today to survey fire damage, and reportedly invited along California’s Democratic senator Adam Schiff, a leading antagonist who he has insulted repeatedly. Politico broke the news yesterday, along with Trump’s invitation to the state’s other senator, Democrat Alex Padilla. Both declined, with their offices saying they needed to remain in Washington to vote. As he departed the White House this morning for the trip that will also take him to hurricane-ravaged areas of North Carolina, a reporter asked Trump why he invited Schiff, given their bad blood. Trump replied: I don’t know. Is he going? Is he going? I don’t know. I mean, I really don’t know. You know, if he’s going to be there it would be cheaper but I didn’t invite him. Somebody did. Congresswoman Melanie Stansbury is the top Democrat on a subcommittee that will support the “Department of government efficiency” (Doge), the Elon Musk-backed initiative to streamline the federal government. In an interview with CNN today, Stansbury said she believes the quasi-governmental department is less interested in efficiency, and more interested in policies that will benefit Musk and other wealthy businesses: We believe that they’re going to use the Doge subcommittee to eviscerate the federal workforce. We think they’re going to go after federal departments, agency heads. We think they’re going to go after the retirement benefits and use it also to restructure the government as a way to be essentially a personal piggy bank for Elon Musk. I mean, I think none of us really understand why Elon Musk is even interested in restructuring the government, except for that he has billions of dollars in federal contracts. And I think it’s notable that up until the inauguration, he was operating his arm of DOGE out of SpaceX, which is the company that he has billions of dollars in front of the federal government with. The Trump administration may deploy as many as 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border and construct detention facilities for migrants on military bases, CBS News reports. The president earlier this week sent 1,500 active-duty troops to the border, adding to a preexisting deployment authorized under Joe Biden. The memo circulating in government says Trump may dramatically expand the troop presence to make good on his campaign promise of stopping border crossers. Here’s more, from CBS: The internal Customs and Border Protection memo dated Jan. 21 indicates there’s a plan to dispatch “~10,000 soldiers” to help the agency’s mission at the southern border. The Trump administration, according to the document, has submitted an “[u]nrestrained request” for the Pentagon to surge resources and personnel to assist CBP with technology and infrastructure. The memo also says the Defense Department “may” convert its bases into “holding facilities,” presumably to help CBP detain migrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally. Additionally, the memo shows the Trump administration is planning to dramatically expand detention capacity at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is expected to be at the center of Mr. Trump’s promised mass deportations. According to the document, ICE officials want 14 new detention facilities with the capacity to hold up to 1,000 migrants each and another four able to accommodate as many as 10,000 immigrant detainees each. Chicago was said to be an initial target of the mass deportations Donald Trump promised on his first day in office. But the promised raids did not wind up taking place, and it’s unclear if and when they will. Politico reports that the word in the Illinois state government is that Trump is interested more in spectacle than substance when it comes to immigration enforcement. “It’s not like anyone with the Trump administration is picking up the phone and calling us and saying ‘Here’s the plan,’” an Illinois state official told Politico. “They’re looking for a PR stunt.” Donald Trump’s threats to carry out mass arrests in cities that have curtailed cooperation with immigration authorities have spread fear throughout communities, the Guardian’s Maanvi Singh reports: Chicago’s Lower West Side felt uneasily quiet this week. Christina Alejandra, a dancer and local business owner in the city’s artsy, majority Mexican American neighborhood, wondered whether it was because of the freezing temperatures, or the impending threat of immigration raids. The city has been preparing for weeks for a crackdown, after Donald Trump’s new administration made clear that so-called sanctuary cities – communities like Chicago that refuse to hand over immigrants to federal authorities – would be the first targets of its mass-deportation program. But the fear didn’t really hit Alejandra, who’s 26 and undocumented, until Monday, inauguration day, as Trump began unleashing a barrage of new immigration restrictions. “I’ve never been scared like this before,” she said. The Guardian is not publishing Alejandra’s full name to protect her and her family from immigration enforcement. Chicago and surrounding areas have seen raids before, including during the first Trump administration. “But this feels different,” Alejandra said. “The way he and his supporters are riled up. There’s a shift happening.” Such worries have been stirred up in immigrant communities across the US in recent days, amid a flood of new executive orders setting strict limits on who can enter the US, who can stay here and who can call themselves an American, setting off unprecedented waves of panic within the country and at its borders. Moments after the president was sworn into office, asylum seekers waiting to enter the country learned that their appointments to meet with Customs and Border Protection had been cancelled – and images of devastated and desperate people at the border made a stark diptych with the inaugural ceremonies. Republican congressman Andy Ogles has proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow Donald Trump to serve a third term in office. The Tennessee lawmaker said he was making the proposal because he thinks Trump has done such a great job over the past few days: President Trump’s decisive leadership stands in stark contrast to the chaos, suffering, and economic decline Americans have endured over the past four years. He has proven himself to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing our nation’s decay and restoring America to greatness, and he must be given the time necessary to accomplish that goal. To that end, I am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to revise the limitations imposed by the 22nd Amendment on presidential terms. This amendment would allow President Trump to serve three terms, ensuring that we can sustain the bold leadership our nation so desperately needs. The amendment is written in such a way that the three other living presidents who have served two terms – Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama – would not be eligible to run again. It is very difficult to amend the US constitution, and it remains to be seen if Ogles’s idea is to be taken seriously. Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has announced that “deportation flights have begun,” and shared photos of people lining up to board a military aircraft. Leavitt’s comment was light on details, but perhaps she means they have begun under Trump administration, as there was plenty of deporting going on during Joe Biden’s just-concluded presidency: The Senate may take a final vote on confirming Pete Hegseth to lead the Pentagon this evening. Yesterday, the Republican-controlled chamber narrowly voted to begin debate on the former Fox News host’s nomination, which has been dogged by a sexual assault allegation and other reports of poor behavior. Two Republican senators and all Democrats voted against confirming Hegseth, but that wasn’t enough to stop the nomination from proceeding. A vote on his final confirmation could take place at 9pm ET. Here’s the latest on his nomination: US health agency employees are now banned from nearly all travel and certain agencies and programs have been ordered to stop issuing new contracts and grants until further notice. The limits on travel and spending, announced internally on Wednesday, add to previous indefinite halts on external communications, including publishing new reports or even posting to social media, and on reviewing and approving new medical research, a nearly $50bn industry in the US. Employees of the 13 agencies overseen by US Health and Human Services (HHS) may only travel to return from assignments or to escape life-threatening situations. That means regular meetings with state and local health officials, training sessions and grant reviews are now on hold. Many Americans agree that the federal government is beset by inefficiency, corruption and needless bureaucracy, but they are less sure about whether aspiring trillionaire Elon Musk is the right person to tackle it. An Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research poll shows only 30% adults in the USA strongly or somewhat approve of Donald Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge), which Musk leads. The poll also shows, despite prevailing wisdom on some social media sites, that Americans aren’t particularly worried about “deep state” actors undermining Trump’s Republican agenda. They’re also unmoved about cuts to large numbers of federal jobs and moving federal agencies outside Washington. Only one-third of US adults have a favourable view of Musk, the world’s richest person. Approximately half of Americans think of Musk and Trump in unfavourable terms. US adults broadly think it’s a bad thing if the president relies on billionaires for advice about government policy, according to the poll. About 60% of those polled say this would be a “very” or “somewhat” bad thing, while only about one in 10 call it a very or somewhat good thing, three in 10 are neutral. The United Nations says the right to seek asylum is “universally recognised” after Trump suspended all refugee admissions and halted the US asylum programme. “All states are entitled to exercise their jurisdiction along their international borders, [but] they need to do so in line with their human rights obligations,” UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani says, according to AFP news agency. “The right to seek asylum is a universally recognised human right,” she adds. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order suspending the Refugee Admissions Program, saying the US “lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities”. The move blocked 1,600 approved Afghan refugees from moving to the States, while over 3,000 others are waiting in Albania to be resettled. The UNHCR said yesterday that “refugee resettlement is a life-saving measure”, and they are “ready to continue our work with the new administration to find solutions for refugees”. Unity, in this sense, is the threshold requirement for people to live together in a free society, it is the solid rock, as Jesus said, in this case upon which to build a nation. It is not conformity. It is not a victory of one over another. It is not weary politeness nor passivity born of exhaustion. Unity is not partisan. Rather, unity is a way of being with one another that encompasses and respects differences, that teaches us to hold multiple perspectives and life experiences as valid and worthy of respect; that enables us, in our communities and in the halls of power, to genuinely care for one another even when we disagree. Those across our country who dedicate their lives, or who volunteer, to help others in times of natural disaster, often at great risk to themselves, never ask those they are helping for whom they voted in the past election or what positions they hold on a particular issue. We are at our best when we follow their example… Germany’s former foreign minister has suggested that Canada be invited to join the European Union, giving voice to an unlikely proposition that has quietly circulated since Donald Trump began floating the idea of Canada becoming the US’s 51st state. Speaking to Germany’s Pioneer Media, Sigmar Gabriel pointed to the shifting geopolitics ushered in by Trump’s second term. “We should invite Canada to become a member of the European Union,” said Gabriel, adding: “They are more European than some European member states anyway.” Gabriel, who was also Germany’s vice-chancellor from 2013 to 2018, said it was an idea worth pursuing, even if Canada is not geographically located in Europe. “I would give it a try. Canada is an enormously important country. It is, by the way, a strategic Arctic border state … We need to gather allies. That also applies to our free trade agreements.” His suggestion echoed an opinion column published earlier this year in The Economist and which argued that the union would be beneficial for both as “Canada is vast and blessed with natural resources but relatively few people, while the EU is small, cramped and mineral-poor’. On Thursday Trump again called on Canada to join the US as he addressed the Davos economic forum in Switzerland by video link: “As you probably know, I say, ‘You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we won’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you.’” Canadian officials have repeatedly slammed any such suggestion, with one minister describing it as something out of a “Southpark episode.” Polls carried out in recent weeks on both sides of the border have suggested that the vast majority of Canadians and many Americans disapprove of the idea. In an address to the annual World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump said that the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries shares responsibility for the ongoing Ukrainian War due to keeping oil prices too high. Trump said that “if the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately”. Asked about Trump’s comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The conflict doesn’t depend on oil prices,” Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. “The conflict is ongoing because of the threat to Russia’s national security, the threat to Russians living on those territories and the refusal by the Americans and the Europeans to listen to Russia’s security concerns. It’s not linked to oil prices.” Asked to comment on Trump’s claim that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready for a deal, Peskov said: “Zelenskyy can’t be ready for a deal.” He added: “In order to reach a settlement it’s necessary to conduct talks, and Zelenskyy forbade himself to hold talks by his own decree.” On Wednesday, Trump threatened Russia with more tariffs, taxes and sanctions if they don’t end the war. Peskov said that the Kremlin was paying close attention to Trump’s statements, insisting Moscow “remains ready for an equal dialogue, for a mutually respectful dialogue”. “This dialogue took place between the two presidents during Trump’s first presidency. And we are waiting for signals that we have not received yet,” Peskov said. Spare a thought for the grifters. Those sad Brits who have spent years toadying up to Donald Trump in the belief they had been admitted into his gilded inner circle. Those men and women who bravely posted selfies on X as they arrived in Washington in the belief they would be attending the inauguration of The Donald. There was Liz Truss looking like a cheap Paddington Bear in a blue coat and red Maga hat announcing her arrival in DC. Only to go mysteriously silent when she discovered she hadn’t made the cut. Not just to the Rotunda where the main action was being staged but also not to the overspill area in the Capitol where guests could follow proceedings on TV. Presumably Lizzie was left to watch the action on her phone in a McDonald’s somewhere downtown… Russia says it is open to negotiating nuclear disarmament, the BBC reports. The Russian government will work with Washington, but only if the nuclear weapons of the UK and France are on the negotiation table, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov’s comments come in the aftermath of US president Donald Trump’s announcement on Thursday that he wanted to work towards reducing nuclear arms. Trump indicated that Russia and China could possibly support reducing their own nuclear arsenals. Peskov said: “We are certainly interested in starting the negotiation process as soon as possible.” But he also added: “In the current situation, all nuclear capacities need to be taken into account. In particular, it’s impossible to hold a conversation without taking into consideration the nuclear capacities of France and the United Kingdom. The current realities make it necessary.” In a series of newly unearthed podcasts, Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, appears to endorse the theocratic and authoritarian doctrine of “sphere sovereignty”, a worldview derived from the extremist beliefs of Christian reconstructionism (CR) and espoused by churches aligned with far-right Idaho pastor Douglas Wilson. In the recordings, Hegeth rails against “cultural Marxism”, feminism, “critical race theory”, and even democracy itself, which he says “our founders blatantly rejected as being completely dangerous”. For much of the over five hours of recordings, which were published over February and March 2024, Hegseth also castigates public schools, which he characterizes as implementing an “egalitarian, dystopian LGBT nightmare”, and which podcast host Joshua Haymes describes as “one of Satan’s greatest tools for excising Christ from not just our classrooms but our country”. President Donald Trump is due to make a speech via video link to the March for Life rally, America’s largest annual anti-abortion rally later on Friday. The president pardoned 23 anti-abortion activists a day before the March for Life in Washington DC. Trump is not the first president to address the rally. Previous Republican presidents, including George W Bush and Ronald Reagan, have addressed the group remotely. However, in 2020, Trump became the first US president to attend the rally in person. The annual rally began in 1974 after the legalisation of abortion established in Roe v Wade. While some have praised Donald Trump for issuing “full, complete and unconditional” pardons for the 1,500 individuals involved in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Pamela Hemphill has pushed back. Hemphill, who was also arrested on January 6, has refused to accept Trump’s pardon, instead deciding to take responsibility for the role she played in trying to overturn the 2020 election results which made Joe Biden victorious over Trump. “Absolutely not,” Hemphill, 71, told the Guardian on Thursday. “It’s an insult to the Capitol police officers and to the rule of law and to the nation. It contributes to the propaganda that it was a peaceful protest, that the DoJ is weaponized against them and against Trump.”… Trump has erroneously claimed that California could have mitigated the wildfires sooner if it hadn’t been for redirecting water to the Pacific Ocean. The president was referring to the water federally managed by the Central Valley Project. However, the agency mostly supplies farms and doesn’t carry water to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California says it has ample storage to meet the region’s water needs. In the first hours of his second term, Trump encouraged federal officials to route more water to the crop-rich Central Valley and densely populated cities in the southern part of the state, even threatening to withhold federal disaster aid unless state leaders change their approach on water. He has continued to question how California’s water managed. Last year on his Truth Social platform, he criticized the “rerouting of MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A DAY FROM THE NORTH OUT INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, rather than using it, free of charge, for the towns, cities, &amp; farms dotted all throughout California”. Trump has suggested that state officials “ turn the valve ” to send more water to the city. But state water supplies are not to blame for hydrants running dry and a key reservoir near Pacific Palisades that was not filled California’s water system is complicated. Most of the region’s water is in the north, while the bulk of the state’s population is in the drier south. Los Angeles is the second driest city in America and relies on water from elsewhere. As does the dry Central Valley, where most of California’s produce is grown. Two complex systems of dams and canals move rain and melted snow from the mountainous north to the south. One is managed by the federal government, the Central Valley Project, while the other is operated by the state of California and known as the State Water Project. Both systems channel water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, an estuary supporting wildlife, including salmon and the delta smelt. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also manages its own aqueducts that draw water from the eastern Sierra Nevada. The Federal government decides how much water is routed to the delta to protect threatened species and how much goes to Central Valley Project users, mostly farms. That project does not supply water to Los Angeles. However, Trump insists the state lets too much water go to the ocean rather than cities and farms. The US Department of State has banned consular posts from flying any flags other than that of the US as part of the Trump administration’s pledge to crack down on diversity efforts in government institutions. A cable seen by the Guardian titled “One flag policy” appears to target several instances during the Biden administration when gay pride and Black Lives Matters flags were flown at embassies abroad. Gay pride flags were also on display at the White House during a 2023 Pride month celebration held on the south lawn, sparking a backlash from conservatives… Gavin Newsom has signed a $2.5bn relief package to help areas of Los Angeles recover from the devastating fires that have been burning for nearly two weeks. The funds were announced during a press conference on Thursday in Pasadena, just outside Altadena, the town hit hardest by the Eaton fire, which ignited on 7 January. The signing of the bipartisan aid package comes a day before Donald Trump is set to visit the fire-torn areas and amid continued criticism of the California governor and other state officials’ management of the state’s water supply. It also follows a new blaze, the Hughes fire, which sparked on Wednesday morning and quickly grew. It is now 36% contained and has burned nearly 10,400 acres (4,209 hectares), according to Cal Fire. The largest of the recent Los Angeles-area blazes ignited on 7 January, ripping through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles and killing 11 people. The Eaton fire, which broke out the same day near Altadena, killed 17 people. According to an internal government memo obtained by the New York Times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials will have powers normally reserved for encounters at America’s border with Mexico to quickly remove migrants. Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and the architect of Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, has made clear that he opposed both programs. “Here’s an idea: Don’t fly millions of illegal aliens from failed states thousands of miles away into small towns across the American Heartland,” Miller said on social media in September. Reacting to the memo, Tom Jawetz, a senior lawyer in the Homeland Security Department in the Biden administration, said: “In addition to raising serious legal concerns, subjecting people who played by the rules to a summary deportation process is an outrageous and unprecedented betrayal.” Karen Tumlin, the director of the Justice Action Center, an immigrant advocacy group, said the decision was a mistake: “American communities have opened their hearts and homes for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Afghanistan and Ukraine,” she said. “Punishing people who did everything the government asked, and many of whom had US-based sponsors, to this summary deportation procedure is appalling.” Nick Brown, the Washington state attorney general, spoke outside after a federal judge temporarily blocked Donald Trump’s executive order redefining birthright citizenship. “We came to the courthouse today to defend the United States constitution. To defend democracy in America and to defend what it means to be an American citizen,” Brown said. In the first few days of his presidency, people tried to challenge and reason with Donald Trump – suing his administration, questioning his decisions to reporters and pleading to him for mercy. But does Trump care what his critics think? Jonathan Freedland speaks to Susan Glasser of the New Yorker about what we can expect from a leader who goes it alone… US president Donald Trump says he would “rather not” impose tariffs on China, after repeatedly pledging to hit the nation with hefty import levies. Trump said he could make a deal with America’s biggest economic rival because “we have something that they want, we have a pot of gold”. “We have one very big power over China, and that’s tariffs, and they don’t want them, and I’d rather not have to use it. But it’s a tremendous power over China,” he said in an interview with Fox News which aired on Thursday in the United States. When Trump took office he said 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports could kick in by 1 February – and on the campaign trail touted a levy as high as 60%. On Friday Beijing called for the US and China to resolve their differences through “dialogue and consultation”. “China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial,” foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. “Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners and don’t serve anyone’s interests or the world’s interests,” she added.","2025-01-25T02:30:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/24/us-politics-donald-trump-tariffs-china-birthright-citizenship-latest-news-updates"

A loneliness epidemic that state cash can’t solve, 23 October), as a Polish woman, I was astonished that the article makes no mention of Poland’s abortion laws as a major factor in the birth rate. This was particularly surprising as it was published just one day after the fifth anniversary of further restrictions being introduced by the constitutional tribunal, staffed by judges loyal to the Law and Justice party (PiS). The Guardian itself has reported on the consequences of this decision, and the countrywide protests that followed, numerous times (for example, in 2021 and 2023). All Polish women know about Izabela, who died from sepsis in 2021 when she was 22 weeks pregnant. Women are scared that if they fall pregnant and experience complications, they will not receive adequate care. Unfortunately, the current government has done close to nothing to assuage their fears, despite being elected on the promise of liberalising the laws.

"abortion","Fate of Wyoming’s last abortion clinic in balance as Republicans take aim","There’s a small, unremarkable beige building in downtown Casper, the heart of Wyoming’s oil country, tucked between a Sinclair gas station and a local dry cleaner. Most days of the week, the building attracts a small throng of protesters. In May 2022, it was burned down just three weeks before a new business was set to open in the building. Since it finally opened in 2023, Wyoming lawmakers have passed a number of laws designed specifically to shut it down. Wyoming’s 2025 legislative session, which has just ended, has brought them closer than ever to succeeding in obstructing the work of Wellspring Health Access, the state’s only full-service abortion clinic. Near-total abortion bans went into effect in Wyoming after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, but a Wyoming district court judge overturned the bans last year citing the state’s constitutionally guaranteed right to healthcare access. The case – brought by Wellspring – is currently in the hands of the Wyoming supreme court. Due to an injunction, Wellspring was able to operate during the prolonged legal battle. That changed last week, when the conservative legislature passed a law requiring facilities providing in-clinic abortions meet the regulatory requirements of ambulatory surgical centers, which have entirely different building codes and regulations, requiring a prohibitively expensive relocation. The law would also require doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 10 miles, which is more stringent than its codes for ambulatory surgical centers. Another law mandates a transvaginal ultrasound and 48-hour waiting period for women seeking abortions, and was passed after the legislature overrode the governor’s veto on Thursday. In the meantime, the clinic has paused services for all patients. Wellspring is back in familiar territory – the Wyoming courts – and has filed a lawsuit against both bills. “We’re quite disappointed in the legislature. We saw it coming, but it’s still disappointing,” said Julie Burkhart, Wellspring’s president. The laws are designated by reproductive law experts as Trap laws, anti-abortion policies to chip away at abortion access when a full ban is out of reach. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has opposed legislation identical to Wyoming’s ambulatory surgical center bill, and opposes ultrasound requirements. Republican speaker of the house Chip Neiman was the main sponsor of this session’s ultrasound bill. While Neiman insists the reasoning behind the bill is medical, he admitted during a floor debate this session that his bill also intended to make women “reconsider” their abortions. When asked by the Guardian how he reached a medical position opposed by major medical associations, Neiman opened by talking about the sanctity of life. “That’s a human being,” Neiman said. Neiman continued his answer on his medical position by talking about anti animal-cruelty legislation, an anecdote about a fellow legislator who knew two women who had abortions 40 years ago and said they were severely distraught afterwards, and his belief in abortion bans without exceptions, saying that he favors the death penalty for men who rape women. “There’s more to it than just getting rid of an inconvenience, you know, or something that’s going to impact, your financial, or through rape or incest or whatever,” Neiman said. “I get that that’s traumatic. I believe anybody that perpetrates that on a woman, to me, the death penalty is the best answer.” The new laws would require Wellspring to completely restructure the clinic’s operations. At the moment, people seeking abortions are largely being referred to Colorado, and Burkhart is working out solutions for those that come for its other services, including IUDs, family planning, oral contraceptives, and general gynecological services. Wyoming residents may still choose to receive medication abortions from out of state through the mail, thanks to shield laws that offer protections to providers who prescribe pills to people in states with bans. (A doctor in Jackson, Wyoming, previously prescribed the pills but did not respond to questions from the Guardian asking if this is still the case.) But the loss of the services frozen at Wellspring – which was the only facility in the state providing surgical abortions – will reverberate beyond Casper, the state’s second largest city with a population of under 60,000. Burkhart says the clinic has served people from over 19 states, many coming from states with similarly harsh abortion laws. “We have a commitment to bringing reproductive health services to under-served and under-resourced areas,” Burkhart said. “I come from an agricultural family in Oklahoma, and so for me, that’s very personal, because no matter where you live in the United States, you deserve access to quality healthcare.” Burkhart is no stranger to hostile political conditions, having been an adviser for Kansas doctor George Tiller, who was assassinated in 2009 by an anti-abortion extremist. She worries about the protesters outside, who she says are increasingly emboldened by national politics. “We have a bomb-threat policy. We have an active-shooter policy. These are things that in other businesses, people do not have to think about day to day,” Burkhart said. “Staff have to be alert when they’re out in public. You know, are they being followed? This does not make living life easy.” While the atmosphere in Wyoming’s legislature is hostile to abortion, data suggests that voters in the Cowboy State feel differently. Polling from the University of Wyoming shows that only 11% of residents believe “abortion should never be permitted”. Another 20% support abortion in cases where “the need has been clearly established”, and nearly 40% believe “women should always have access to abortions as a matter of personal choice”. Lawmakers filed five bills targeting abortion at the outset of the 2025 legislative session. Some of the more ambitious measures failed, such as a bill that would have regulated abortion pill chemicals in wastewater by making women bag the remains of their miscarriages and a first-of-its kind effort to exempt abortion from the state’s definition of healthcare, that, in its original draft, would have exempted chemotherapy as well. Burkhart says that her and her staff plan to stay in the fight. After trial by fire with the 2022 arson, she says many people expected her to give up. “I think people thought, and rightfully so, ‘They’re gonna pack up and go home and call it a day here,’” Burkhart said. “But we dug our heels in even deeper.”","2025-03-08T11:00:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/wyoming-abortion-clinic"
"abortion","Trump is weaponizing the welfare state to attack healthcare","In United States v Skrmetti, a supreme court decision issued this summer, the rightwing justices made it legal for states to ban gender-affirming care for trans minors, in a ruling whose reasoning strained logic, claiming that state laws banning the treatment did not discriminate on the basis of sex. The ruling upheld laws in 27 states, all of them passed since 2021, which banned the treatment outright; according to the Human Rights Campaign, about 40% of trans minors live in states where treatment for them is against the law. Now, the Trump administration seems to be looking to cut off access to care for the other 60% of those kids. In a proposed rule leaked to NPR, the administration plans to ban gender-affirming care for minors from being covered by Medicaid or by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or Chip. In a second, more sweeping proposed rule, the Trump administration looks to ban hospitals, clinics and providers from receiving any Medicaid or Medicare reimbursements at all if their practice provides transition-related pediatric care. If enacted, the orders – which NPR reports are scheduled for a rollout in early November – would dramatically reduce the number of providers able to treat trans teens, even in states where the care remains legal. Unable to keep their practices financially viable without reimbursements for care provided to Medicare and Medicaid recipients, the majority of medical professionals currently treating trans kids with puberty blockers, hormones or affirming forms of psychotherapy would be forced to stop providing such treatment. The result would be a back-door ban on transition-related care for minors nationwide: even in states that have not passed laws banning the care, like the one upheld in Skrmetti, trans teens and their families – even those are able to pay for the care – would not be able to find a doctor willing to help them. The move is remarkably similar to one that the Trump administration and their allies have pursued with respect to abortion access. After the supreme court’s 2022 Dobbs decision allowed states to ban abortion, Republicans placed a provision in last summer’s budget reconciliation bill that excluded Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, from receiving Medicaid reimbursements; the ban was later allowed to proceed by an appeals court. Abortions themselves are already almost entirely banned from Medicaid reimbursement; the bill went further, as the Trump administration’s proposed order on gender-affirming care does, by saying that no practice that provides such treatment can receive Medicaid reimbursements for any care that they give. The exclusion of Planned Parenthood from Medicaid means that clinics are shutting their doors even in Democratic-controlled states where the procedure remains legal, making it much, much more difficult for women to end their pregnancies and restricting access to the care nationwide. Technically, neither of these moves bans the targeted care: under the proposed trans care rules, and under the current Planned Parenthood Medicaid ban, none of the disfavored medical care is technically illegal under federal law, and states retain the option of allowing it. But just because something is technically legal does not mean that it is actually accessible: both of these policies function to place the medical care that gives these groups dignity, safety and control over their own lives out of their reach. The proposed exclusion of youth gender-affirming care providers from Medicaid and Medicare, and the continuing exclusion of abortion providers from Medicaid, point to one of the Trump administration’s more perverse strategies for punishing disfavored groups and accumulating power: the weaponization of the welfare state. Medicare and Medicaid were implemented to provide dignity and compassion to the nation’s elderly and impoverished. However flawed and partial these programs are their actual implementation, they are based on the principle that the state can improve the lives of its citizens, that it can catch those who fall prey to age or poverty, and recognize their membership in the American community with care. Above all, such welfare programs are tools of equality: they give Americans a degree of the dignity and freedom that are prerequisites to democratic citizenship. They prevent the kind of inequality that makes a farce of pretenses to republican government. Now, with the exclusion of certain kinds of care from these programs, the Trump regime has inverted Medicare and Medicaid into handmaids of inequality, wielded to degrade, humiliate, marginalize and punish certain Americans on the basis of their sex and gender. It is a playbook that the Republican right is using more and more. Under John Roberts, the supreme court has long been a fan of using statutes and constitutional amendments that were meant to mitigate racial inequality – like the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th amendment – for ends opposite to those of the lawmakers’. This is why it is on the basis of a scurrilous claim of racial discrimination against white and Asian students that the court could bar race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities that are meant to more fairly distribute educational opportunities among Black youth. And it is why this spring, in a 14th amendment race discrimination case brought by “non-African-American” (read: white) voters in Louisiana, the court will almost certainly gut what remains of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The Trump administration has followed the court’s lead, subverting civil rights laws meant to curb inequality in order to entrench it instead. Of particular note is the Trump administration’s weaponization of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act against colleges and universities where students have staged pro-Palestinian and anti-genocide protests. The Trump administration has sought to marginalize pro-Palestinian speech and punish schools that do not crack down on it with false allegations of antisemitism leveled at these universities under the civil rights law. Using these lawsuits and threats of withdrawals of federal funding, the Trump administration has been able to not only ensure crackdowns on disfavored minorities, but ensure much broader changes at many targeted institutions to hiring, curriculum and admissions policies. The welfare state, and the civil rights legal regime, have long been targets of the right; now, they have become their perverse tools, paths that the far right takes into Americans’ personal lives and most essential institutions in order to enforce a narrow, prescriptive and exclusive set of cultural values, namely white supremacy, sexism and a virulent transphobia. Those of us on the left will have to grapple both with the future of the welfare state and with the role of civil rights laws in a post-Trump world: as potent as these tools have been for ensuring a degree of dignity for Americans, they have also proved potent avenues for oppressing them.

"abortion","Fetus of brain-dead Georgia woman kept alive due to abortion ban is growing, says family","The foetus of a brain-dead Georgia woman who is being kept alive to carry out her pregnancy is continuing to grow, the woman’s mother said late Monday, days after the controversial case exploded into the national news and sparked questions about the ethics of using the state’s anti-abortion law to keep a woman with no chance of recovery on life support. “He has his toes, arms, limbs – everything is forming,” the woman’s mother, April Newkirk, told the local news station 11Alive. “We’re just hoping he makes it.” The Georgia woman, Adriana Smith, went to a hospital in February with what she thought was an intense headache, Newkirk, told 11 Alive, which first reported the story. At the time, Smith was about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The hospital discharged Smith after providing her with medication, Newkirk said. The next day, Smith was rushed back to the hospital after she woke up gasping for air. The hospital diagnosed her with blood clots in her brain. Within hours, she was declared brain-dead. Under Georgia law, abortion is banned after about six weeks of pregnancy. That ban also contains provisions that strengthen the concept of “fetal personhood”, a doctrine that holds that embryos and foetuses should be considered people – and, as such, are entitled to full legal rights and protections. Newkirk said doctors told the family the law requires keeping her alive to preserve the pregnancy. “We didn’t have a choice or a say about it,” Newkirk said. “We want the baby. That’s a part of my daughter. But the decision should have been left to us – not the state.” Smith is currently about 22 weeks into her pregnancy. The hospital plans to keep Smith on life support until early August, when doctors will deliver the baby through a caesarean section, 11Alive reported. “The chances of there being a healthy newborn at the end of this is very, very small,” Steven Ralston, the director of the maternal fetal medicine division at George Washington University, told the Washington Post. Newkirk said last week that the baby has fluid in the brain. “He may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. The family has named the baby Chance, Newkirk said. “Right now, the journey is for baby Chance to survive,” Newkirk said on Monday. “Whatever condition God allows him to come here in, we’re going to love him just the same.” Smith’s case has sparked a nationwide debate about medical consent and the potentially sweeping reach of anti-abortion laws. Abortion rights activists have spent years warning about these laws’ unforeseen consequences, as instituting fetal personhood can lead to the rights of a pregnant person being pitted against that of the foetus inside them. In the years since Roe v Wade’s 2022 overturning, dozens of pregnant women have said that abortion bans led them to be denied abortions even in medical emergencies. The hospital where Smith is currently located has not commented on her case, citing privacy laws. However, it said in a statement that it “uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws”. The office of Georgia’s attorney general, Chris Carr, has released a statement declaring that Georgia’s six-week law does not require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after being declared brain-dead. “Removing life support is not an action with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” Carr’s spokesperson, Kara Murray, said in the statement. Some anti-abortion advocates, however, have taken the opposite view. Georgia state Sen. Ed Setzler, who sponsored the state’s abortion ban, told the Associated Press that “it is completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child”. He continued: “I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.” Students for Life of America, a powerful national anti-abortion group, has also backed the decision to keep Smith on life support. “While Adriana can no longer speak for herself, her son’s life still matters. Her doctors are doing the right thing by treating him as a unique patient,” the organization said in a statement, which was accompanied by a fundraiser for Smith’s family. Smith’s family has their own fundraiser to help cover costs associated with her care and the possibilities that her son will be born with disabilities.","2025-05-20T18:11:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/pregnant-georgia-woman-brain-dead"
"abortion","Couple who bought abortion pills online given community orders","A man and woman who were accused of buying pills to induce an illegal abortion have been sentenced to community orders. Sophie Harvey, 25, had previously stood trial accused of procuring her own miscarriage when she was 19. Prosecutors had alleged she took the medication after learning she was at 28 weeks and five days gestation – meaning she could not get a legal abortion in England as she was beyond the 24-week cutoff. Harvey and her boyfriend, Elliot Benham, 25, always accepted they had bought abortion pills online. But Harvey insisted she had never taken them and had instead given birth to a stillborn child in the bathroom of her home in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in September 2018. The couple had stood trial at Gloucester crown court in May this year, but the jury was discharged by a judge after an application by their lawyers who cited inaccurate reports of the proceedings by the BBC. Harvey described to the court how she was left upset and confused after going into labour at home and wrapped the baby in a towel before placing it into the household waste bin. Following the collapse of the trial, prosecutors had sought a new trial, and a date had been fixed for February next year. But at a further hearing on Wednesday, a new charge of conspiracy to procure a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage was put to them, which they both admitted. The crown also accepted a plea of endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child. They pleaded not guilty to procuring a poison to be used with intent to procure a miscarriage, and doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice. Harvey also pleaded not guilty to administering poison with intent to procure a miscarriage. The court agreed for the charges to lie on file. Sentencing the pair at Gloucester crown court, Judge Ian Lawrie KC said: “I am sadly too familiar with your case. I am familiar with the background and what took place. It has been a long and painful journey.” The judge added: “The impact upon your lives has been traumatic and I am sure this will continue for some time. If you can, and I doubt it, put it all behind you and get on with your lives.” Harvey was handed an 18-month community order, alongside an 18-month mental health treatment order, the latter of which the judge said she should “not view as punishment”. Benham was sentenced to an 18-month community order and 150 hours of unpaid work to be completed over 12 months. During the previous trial, Harvey told police she and Benham had gone to a clinic in August 2018 after she found out she was pregnant, but they were told she was “too far gone” for a legal termination. She had clutched a hot-water bottle and appeared to hyperventilate as she struggled to express her distress at losing the baby in September 2018 and her shock when she and her boyfriend were arrested on suspicion of killing the child in November of that year. She bowed her head and shook as the jury at Gloucester crown court was told how police arrived after midnight to detain her on suspicion of murder, held her in a cell and took a sample of her hair, which was checked for traces of abortion drugs. The prosecution had claimed the couple had ordered abortion pills illegally online, and that Harvey had taken one. Prosecutors said the couple then disposed of the baby. At Wednesday’s sentencing hearing, the prosecutor Anna Vigars told the court that the couple had been together for about one year when Harvey unexpectedly became pregnant. When they were told how advanced the pregnancy was, she said “both of them appeared very shocked by the news they were given”. She said “alarm bells were triggered” when Harvey did not seek antenatal care, and “eventually the police were asked to go and see her”. Defending Harvey, Tom Godfrey said she had been “retraumatised” by the court process, “having gone through the trauma of the stillbirth, to have to relieve the events seven years later”. Clare Evans, defending Benham, said he had also been “deeply traumatised by what has happened over the last six years”, and that he “knows this was an avoidable set of circumstances that came upon them that they then dealt with very badly”. Campaigners calling for a change in the law have criticised the prosecution, saying it had not been in the public interest to pursue the case. One relative said the pair, who had never been in trouble with the police before, had been deeply changed by their experience. “They are both good kids but they are very different people now.” The relative said it was “disgraceful” that the case had hung over them for so long. Another person close to Harvey said she never spoke about what happened – and to have been forced to do so in a crown court witness box was deeply traumatic. A letter from Harvey’s mother, to the court, read: “I want to see my daughter gain her life back, and go and live life and be able to move on from all of this. I just want to see my happy little girl again.” Letters from her friends were also read to the court, with one describing her as “completely broken.” A CPS spokesperson said: “Our duty is to apply the law set by parliament impartially – especially when dealing with the most difficult or complex decisions. The defendants pleaded guilty to two offences, and after careful reflection we have concluded that it is not in the public interest to pursue further charges.” Dr Tracey Masters, the British Society of Abortion Care Providers co-chair, said: “It can never be in the public interest to prosecute women for ending their own pregnancy, and we stand with all the other organisations who call for the law to be urgently changed.” Last year, Carla Foster, from Staffordshire, was jailed for ending her pregnancy beyond the time limit during a coronavirus lockdown. Her sentence of 28 months, imposed at Stoke crown court, was later reduced to 14 months at the court of appeal and suspended, freeing her from custody a month after she was jailed, with judges saying her case called for “compassion, not punishment”. In the last parliament, MPs proposed amendments to the criminal justice bill that sought to change the law on abortion, but these were not put to a vote in parliament. One had been tabled by the Labour MP, Stella Creasy, who said: “The prosecution of women for having an abortion under outdated laws in England and Wales has to stop – as the judge highlighted, the trauma of this has compounded an already distressing situation involving a vulnerable young woman, which has dragged on for six years. “It’s time to decriminalise abortion and recognise this is a healthcare matter.”","2024-12-18T20:37:57Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/18/man-and-woman-sentenced-illegal-abortion"
"abortion","New Trump rule to ban VA abortions for veterans even in cases of rape and incest","Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be barred from performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under new rules proposed by the Trump administration. The draft regulations, which also forbid providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have generated nearly 20,000 comments in the federal register from conservative activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them survivors of sexual assault. “I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved my life,” wrote Mary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia. Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, “I don’t think I would have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.” The rule proposed by the Trump administration has an exception that allows abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion rights advocates said the exception was too limited. “Women are going to die,” predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of Pennsylvania. She said the exception would force “a woman to lie in the hospital bed until that woman is on death’s door” and cited high-profile cases of women dying after being denied miscarriage care in states that have strict abortion bans. Sexual assault remains endemic in the military. About one in three women and one in 50 men respond “yes” when asked by their VA provider if they had been forced to endure sexual activity against their will while in uniform. Separate anonymous surveys have put the figure as high as two in three female veterans. VA researchers have also found one in three female veterans experience intimate partner violence, a rate far higher than women who never served in the military. Rita Graham, a former US army artillery officer and research director of the Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN), said the rules were “unsafe and cruel and strip our military community of their right to make their own healthcare decisions. “We fought for our freedoms and deserve the healthcare that comes with that,” she said. The availability of abortions is relatively new at VA. The agency has only provided them under limited circumstances since 2022, following a policy change implemented by the Biden administration after the supreme court ended the federal right to abortion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health. In an emailed response to questions, the VA press secretary, Peter Kasperowicz, described the Biden administration’s policy as “politically motivated” and said it violated a 1992 law that forbade the agency from providing abortions “except for such care relating to a pregnancy that is complicated or in which the risks of complication are increased by a service-connected condition”. Legal experts say that law has been superseded. They note it also bans the VA from providing infertility and pregnancy care, which the agency continues to offer. The VA also characterized the change as a matter of patient safety, claiming the “infrequency” with which the VA has performed the procedure since the 2022 policy was enacted had “raised safety concerns”. According to the agency, veterans and their beneficiaries have received only 140 abortions per year under the policy through the VA. Trump’s VA secretary, Doug Collins, is a staunch abortion opponent. As a congressman, he received an A+ rating from Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America and referred to the 1973 supreme court decision that established the right to abortion as “barely coherent”. Women are the fastest-growing group of military veterans, with a significant proportion of female veterans of reproductive age living in Florida, Georgia and Texas – states with near total abortion bans. The comment period for the proposed rules runs through 3 September. Democrats on Capitol Hill have proposed legislation that would overrule the regulations should they go into effect and establish the legal right for veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortion care, medication and counseling through the VA as a matter of law. The bill has little chance of passage given Republican control of Congress, however. When the VA introduced the proposed rule on 4 August, Republicans on the House veterans affairs committee, led by its chairman, Mike Bost of Illinois, released a joint statement praising the decision. “It’s simple,” they said. “Taxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on paying for abortions – and VA’s sole focus should always be providing service-connected health care and benefits to the veterans they serve.”","2025-08-29T14:51:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-veterans-affairs-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Trump can block Medicaid funds to ‘defund’ Planned Parenthood, court rules","The Trump administration can move forward with its plan to “defund” Planned Parenthood by blocking it from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people, a federal appeals court ruled late on Thursday. The ruling from the first US circuit court of appeals lifts a lower court’s preliminary injunction, which had stopped the Trump administration from enacting a provision of its tax and spending bill that axed Planned Parenthood’s ability to participate in Medicaid for one year. Now, the reproductive health giant estimates that up to 200 Planned Parenthood clinics may face closure, given that 1.1 million Planned Parenthood patients are eligible for Medicaid. “Cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated and patients won’t get the birth control that they need to plan their families and futures,” Alexis McGill Johnson, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a press call on Friday. “Patients will have to travel further to get care and wait longer to get it as demand surges at health centers.” More than 60% of the clinics at risk for closure are in rural or “medically under-served areas”, while roughly 90% of the clinics are located in blue states that currently protect abortion rights, McGill Johnson said. Planned Parenthood clinics provide almost 40% of all US abortions, according to a 2024 report from the independent abortion clinic association Abortion Care Network. “Make no mistake, this is a backdoor abortion ban,” McGill Johnson said. It is already illegal to use federal dollars, including money from Medicaid, to pay for abortions. In 2024, Planned Parenthood clinics treated people who rely on Medicaid at more than 1.5m visits for services such as STI tests, cancer screenings and contraception. However, because anti-abortion activists see Planned Parenthood as a public enemy, they have spent years trying to convince Republicans to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out of Medicaid. During the call, McGill Johnson said Planned Parenthood had developed plans that would permit some regional affiliates to stop providing abortions in states where the procedure remains legal, in order to preserve their ability to receive Medicaid. After the call, a Planned Parenthood Federation of America spokesperson said those plans were no longer being considered. “That is not an attempt to walk away from abortion,” McGill Johnson said. “Planned Parenthood strongly stands behind our need and ability to provide abortion care wherever it is legal in this country. It is simply an opportunity for us to engage our federation to be able to provide the care and also preserve as much funding for reimbursement for the services, just like any other healthcare provider should be able to do.” In an emailed statement, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America spokesperson stressed that “Planned Parenthood healthcare clinics will continue to provide abortion care everywhere it is lawful to do so.” Litigation in the case will continue, as the first circuit is set to hear more substantive arguments in the case in the coming weeks. More than 80 million people in the US use Medicaid, and 11% of female Medicaid beneficiaries who are between the ages of 15 and 49 and who receive family-planning services go to Planned Parenthood, according to an analysis by the non-profit KFF, which tracks healthcare policy. “There’s no back-up plan. There’s no one waiting in the wings to take care of our patients,” said Dominique Lee, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, one of the regional Planned Parenthood affiliates that helped bring the lawsuit over the Trump administration’s provision. “Planned Parenthood is the safety net.”","2025-09-12T18:53:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/planned-parenthood-medicaid-trump"
"abortion","June Dryburgh was asked to help out at an abortion clinic. She stayed for 47 years","When June Dryburgh cleaned out her desk after almost five decades as a counsellor, it was a reminder that even though many of her consultations were brief, their impact was significant. “I found so many letters and cards. There was even a long letter from one woman who wanted to share just how much the care she received at the clinic had meant to her,” she says. Dryburgh started at the East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic (FCC) less than a decade after abortion was effectively decriminalised in Victoria, Australia. She saw first-hand how access to safe abortion changed lives, and personally helped more than 100,000 women. She was also witness to anti-choice campaigners’ relentless efforts to wind back this access, weathering daily harassment of staff and patients, which turned deadly when a gunman entered the clinic in 2001 and shot their security guard. Dryburgh began working at the FCC in 1977. She was 32 and married with a young daughter. Eight years earlier, Victorian supreme court justice Clifford Menhennitt had ruled that an abortion was not illegal if the pregnancy endangered the health of the mother. This ruling, the first in Australia, effectively made back yard abortions in Victoria a thing of the past. The clinic was founded just three years later, in 1972, by high-profile abortion campaigner Dr Bertram Wainer. Dryburgh began working on the front desk, but it was clear that she had a rapport with the women coming in. Counselling came naturally to her, and she returned to study to complete the required qualifications. “I loved helping people. I loved the women,” she says. Dryburgh worked at the clinic until late last year, retiring just shy of her 80th birthday. Although she rarely recognised the women she’d counselled outside the clinic, they remembered her. “Once, at the National Theatre, I met a woman who said to me, ‘I know you from somewhere’, and so I started naming places where we might have met. Finally, and I don’t know if there was anyone else around, I said, ‘Would it have been in East Melbourne?’ The penny dropped, and she said, ‘I knew I’d had a long talk with you somewhere’. Another time I was trying on shoes in a shop in the city, and the girl at my feet said, ‘You’re June, aren’t you? I saw you just the other day’.” Most of the women who came to FCC were very comfortable with their decision, Dryburgh says. “About 80 to 90% are absolutely sure.” For the small percentage that seemed uncertain, she would suggest time away to think about the choice. “They’d come back a different person, and you’d know that they were OK,” she says. Dryburgh’s role was to give women information about what would happen in the procedure and how they might feel afterwards. Knowing this was reassuring and empowering for them, she says. It was Dryburgh’s friend Pippa Green who thought she would be ideal for the role. They had previously worked together at the Postmaster General’s Department in Melbourne. “You needed a particular kind of person to work there, and it wasn’t about qualifications, it was about empathy and kindness and open mindedness,” Green says. Wendy Wishart, Dryburgh’s youngest sister, also worked at the clinic briefly in the 1980s. “June always got on with the underdog,” Wishart says. She still remembers Dryburgh’s easy rapport with the sex workers of Sydney’s Kings Cross, when she worked at a souvenir shop nearby in the early 1970s. “She was never snobby, and always aware of the inequity in life. She would just treat people well, no matter where they came from.” Dryburgh’s community-minded parents shaped this attitude. Growing up in Yackandandah, in north-east Victoria, everyone knew everyone else’s business, she says. Her parents, Jean and Ellis Wishart, were open, welcoming and “great fun”. Many stories from the clinic have stayed with her: the women who came to them because they had been raped, women who were in violent relationships, women who had been coerced into pregnancies, women who had no support because their families were virulently anti-abortion. One week, after Dryburgh had seen three women who were pregnant as a result of rape, she snapped. “I was so upset about it, I went out to the demonstrators and said, ‘Do you really believe that a person who’s been raped should continue with pregnancy?’ And they just looked at me blankly and said: ‘People don’t get pregnant that way.’ “I read later that they really thought that it wasn’t possible. So I decided I would never bother to speak to them again. There was just no point.” Sometimes the protesters out on the street found themselves on the other side of the fence. In her 2006 book, Murder on his Mind – an account of the 2001 shooting at the clinic – psychologist Dr Susie Allanson wrote that Dryburgh offered “compassion and non-judgmental assistance” when a familiar face from the protest group arrived for an appointment. “A lot of those women never think it’s going to happen to them, but when it does they see the reasons people do this,” Dryburgh says. “That’s when a lot of them change their mind about abortion.” For a long time, the protesters outside the clinic ignored Dryburgh. Petite, beautifully groomed and conservatively dressed, it took a while before they realised she was an employee, not a resident of the well-to-do suburb. She enjoyed hiding in plain sight. Once the protesters realised who she was, the verbal abuse became a daily, tiresome ordeal. In 2001, Dryburgh was in the middle of a consultation when she heard gunshots. A gunman entered the clinic and killed security guard Steve Rogers. His plans to destroy the clinic and everyone in it were thwarted by two heroic young men, Tim Anderson and Sandro De Maria, who were there to support their partners. Dryburgh kept her client calm, locked the door and called the police. She was one of several staff members to do so. Although it only took the police eight minutes to arrive, “it felt like an hour”, she says. In Murder on his Mind, Allanson, who worked at FCC for 26 years, mentions Dryburgh often. She was a crucial part of the team’s recovery from the trauma of that day. “June is more than just our senior counsellor,” Allanson writes. She is, “always here, always knowledgable, invincible, indispensable and unflappable … An icon of the clinic.” The clinic shooting catalysed the staff to forcefully campaign for abortion access safe zones. In 2016, the Victorian parliament enacted legislation to enforce a 150m safe zone around abortion clinics. Victoria was the second Australian state to do so, after Tasmania. By 2021, every state and territory in Australia had followed suit. The protesters decamped up the street to outside Jolimont station, a location completely out of context to passersby. “You could see people were wondering what the hell they were doing,” Dryburgh says. Back at the clinic, anyone entering was finally able to do so in peace. Despite the majority of Australians supporting a women’s right to choose, Dryburgh is concerned about the impact US policies might have in Australia, and the increase in rightwing rhetoric locally. “I am appalled about the situation in America,” she says. “Overturning Roe v Wade has disadvantaged millions of poor women and turned the clock back to the bad old days when women were forced to go to unscrupulous operators or try dangerous home remedies. This will result in the deaths of many women. It bothers me greatly that there are forces in Australia that continue to lobby governments to outlaw abortion.” Allanson wrote that Dryburgh was the clinic’s story keeper. “I’ve always said … as have other people, June, you just need to write your memoirs.” When Dryburgh retired last year, writing was the last thing on her mind. For the first few weeks she couldn’t stop sleeping. Now, she has resumed French lessons and is enjoying her free time. “I retired because I thought, ‘I can’t be talking to teenagers about their sex lives when I’m over 80’,” she says. Then she pauses for a moment and smiles. “Actually, I could.”","2025-05-14T15:00:58Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/15/june-dryburgh-was-asked-to-help-out-at-an-abortion-clinic-she-stayed-for-47-years"
"abortion","New Mexico supreme court strikes down local abortion pill restrictions","The New Mexico supreme court late on Thursday ruled against several local ordinances in the state that aim to restrict distribution of the abortion pill. In a unanimous opinion, the court said the ordinances invaded the legislature’s authority to regulate reproductive care. “Our legislature granted to counties and municipalities all powers and duties not inconsistent with the laws of New Mexico. The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the legislature’s authority to regulate access to and provision of reproductive healthcare,” the court wrote in its opinion by the justice Shannon Bacon. It declined to address whether the ordinances violated the state’s constitutional protections. Abortion is legal in New Mexico, which has become a destination for women seeking abortions from Texas, especially, and other states that have banned the procedure following the US supreme court ruling in 2022 ending a woman’s constitutional right to abortion and handing powers over the issue to individual states. Following that ruling, leaders of New Mexico’s Roosevelt and Lea counties and the towns of Clovis and Hobbs, all on the Texas border, passed ordinances seeking to stop abortion clinics from receiving or sending mifepristone, a pill taken with another drug to perform a medication abortion, and other abortion-related materials in the mail. Medication abortions account for more than half of all US abortions. Last June the supreme court upheld access to the drugs. The ordinances invoked the federal Comstock Act, a 19th-century “anti-vice” law against mailing abortifacients, which are drugs that induce abortion, and said that clinics must comply with the law. Under Roosevelt county’s ordinance, any person other than a government employee could bring a civil lawsuit and seek damages of at least $100,000 for each violation of the Comstock Act. The New Mexico supreme court admonished this, saying that creating a private right of action and damages award was “clearly intended to punish protected conduct”. The state attorney general, Raúl Torrez, praised the court’s ruling on Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws pre-empted any action by local governments to engage in activities that would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens. “The bottom line is simply this: abortion access is safe and secure in New Mexico,” he said. “It’s enshrined in law by the recent ruling by the New Mexico supreme court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico legislature.” The New Mexico house speaker, Javier Martínez, called access to healthcare a basic fundamental right in New Mexico. “It doesn’t take a genius to understand the statutory framework that we have. Local governments don’t regulate healthcare in New Mexico. It is up to the state,” the Albuquerque Democrat said. Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the border with Texas, however, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the US. But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New Mexico and hold majorities in the state house and senate, have moved to shore up access to the service. In 2021, the New Mexico legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the Roe v Wade reversal. And in 2023, the Democratic New Mexico governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, signed a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from investigations by other states. In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to local residents and people who travel from neighboring states. The new clinic should open in 2026 to provide services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception, cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in federal court. The New Mexico supreme court opinion explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its decision solely on state provisions. The Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general and architect of that state’s strict abortion ban, said he looked forward “to litigating these issues in other states and bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the supreme court of the United States”.

"abortion","The right to abortion is under threat in Britain. Secure it now – or risk losing it ","Opening the Pandora’s box of abortion reform is something no one should do without the confidence that they are able to manage the resulting chaos. Moves to decriminalise abortion, in response to the continued prosecution of women for having one, could unintentionally enable the restriction of access under a future regressive government. To prevent this and protect services, it is time to write into our statute that safe and legal access to abortion is a human right across our nation. It still shocks many people to realise that in 2025 abortion is not actually legal for most of the UK. Only in Northern Ireland do women have a right to an abortion. Everywhere else they are exempted from prosecution if it is determined they have met certain access conditions. This is not a quaint jurisprudence debate – it is driving the explosion in recent years of investigations and prosecutions of women and girls for having abortions in England. A vulnerable 15-year-old girl who didn’t know she was pregnant and had a late-term miscarriage found a police constable at her hospital bed. Others have spent years under suspicion and investigation, and in some cases in jail. These cases, and the chilling effect they have on services, come at a time when the anti-abortion movement is turning its attention to our shores. Millions of pounds is flowing into campaigning and networking, pushing not for an explicit end to services but “safeguards” – all ruses to make getting a termination harder. Incendiary language abounds, as decriminalisation is claimed to mean “abortion at birth”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has openly criticised our buffer zones that protect women going to clinics from harassment as “anti free speech”. Ever the opportunist, Nigel Farage has argued parliament should debate a reduction in the time limit under which women can secure a termination. At the heart of this is a simple premise – women cannot be trusted to make decisions about their own bodies and should be policed accordingly. I recognise the appeal of simple solutions to stop the prosecutions – including using the upcoming policing bill to insert a clause removing women from the application of the 18th-century act that puts having an abortion on a par with assaulting a clergyman, bigamy and manslaughter. But in our toxic political environment this is to play Russian roulette with abortion access. It is a standard feature of any legislation that it gives the right to make secondary regulations to government about the topics in the bill – the Henry VIII powers that are the mainstay of executive overreach. Inserting the issue of abortion into any act of parliament without directing what happens next is like handing a future government a loaded gun to point at women’s rights – if passed, this would give powers to restrict or even end access to abortion with minimal democratic opportunity to intervene. This risk doesn’t mean we shouldn’t act. The battle to provide abortion at all in Northern Ireland began in earnest once we passed a law requiring the secretary of state to deliver treatment as a human right. Resistance came not just from the Democratic Unionist party, but also from those charged with delivery, including the civil service and healthcare departments. The secretary of state had to intervene or face direct censure. That meant when those in positions of power used their role to prevent services from being set up, ministers knocked heads together and got things moving again. We can learn from this now in protecting existing services such as buffer zones and shape future provision too. It is time that women in Birmingham, Bristol and Barry had the same constitutionally protected right as women in Belfast to a safe medical treatment if they choose not to continue a pregnancy. This week we will lay an alternative amendment to the policing bill that doesn’t just repeal the antiquated criminal law and free women from the threat of prosecution. It also puts in place a plan for what happens next – an explicit human rights framework to ensure safe access and prevent the rolling back of abortion rights, whoever is in power. It would not alter the settled time limit for a termination, nor would it prevent prosecution of anyone who forces a woman to have an abortion. It would mean, for the first time in history, women here could point to their right to choose – and demand it is protected, as it is in France, Mexico, Colombia and Ireland. Any subsequent regulation affecting how abortions are provided, or equally importantly the work of those who offer them, would also have to uphold this human right too. Crucially in our febrile political climate, this amendment comes with a democratic lock to prevent the use of secondary legislative powers to change these rights. If a future government wanted to destroy abortion provision it would have to get the consent of the whole parliament – giving all citizens the ability to lobby their MP accordingly.

"abortion","New York doctor indicted in Louisiana over alleged abortion pill prescription","A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the deep south state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country. Grand jurors at the district court for the parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical PC; and the mother of a minor who was allegedly provided with the abortion pill, according to a New Orleans public radio station. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state – at least since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion. Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges. Carpenter did not immediately return a message, but the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, an organization she co-founded, issued a statement condemning the Louisiana case as “the latest in a series of threats that jeopardizes women’s access to reproductive healthcare throughout this country. “Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we’ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women’s rights,” the statement continued. “It’s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.” The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol – pills commonly used in medical abortions – as “controlled dangerous substances”. The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them. Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own. “I have said it before and I will say it again: we will hold individuals accountable for breaking the law,” the Louisiana attorney general, Liz Murrill, a Republican, said in a statement on Friday. Since the fall of Roe v Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license. In an interview with Talk Louisiana, the district attorney Tony Clayton, a prosecutor on the case, said the minor’s mother gave her the pill. “The minor child was home alone, felt that she had to take the pill because of what her mother told her,” Clayton said. Friday’s indictment could be the first direct test of the ability of New York’s “shield law” to defend doctors from criminal prosecution. In the years after Roe fell, New York became one of a handful of blue states that passed such shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. “This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American,” Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who would enforce the shield law that could protect Carpenter from out-of-state prosecution, said in a statement. “We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers’ ability to deliver critical care.” In the Talk Louisiana interview, Clayton acknowledged the New York shield law but said he thought he would “get over” it. “If that doctor were to travel to a state that has reciprocity with Louisiana, then that presents an issue for the doctor,” Clayton said. “I will seek a warrant and use whatever laws we have in place to effectively have a warrant.” Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the US, accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They are also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.","2025-01-31T20:40:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/new-york-louisiana-abortion-pill-charges"
"abortion","UK woman says she was not at abortion clinic ‘to express views’ after conviction","A woman who was given a conditional discharge after being convicted of breaching a buffer zone outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth has claimed she was “not there to express my views”. Livia Tossici-Bolt, an anti-abortion campaigner whose case has been cited by the US state department over “freedom of expression” concerns in the UK, told the BBC’s Today programme she was “really disappointed” with the conviction “because it’s nothing to do with protesting” and said she would “continue my fight for freedom of speech”. Tossici-Bolt had stood with a sign reading: “Here to talk, if you want” facing the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) clinic, which was previously targeted by anti-abortion activists who had gathered nearby before Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council put the order in place. The campaigner went on trial at Poole magistrates court last month accused of breaching a public spaces protection order in March 2023 near a clinic in Bournemouth. On Friday she was found guilty of two charges of breaching the order. She was given a conditional discharge and ordered not to commit any additional offences over a two-year period. She was ordered to pay costs of £20,000 towards what the judge said had been the “considerable” resources expended by the local authority, along with £26 towards a victim surcharge fee. Tossici-Bolt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “I was not there to express my views. I was there to offer free conversation, consensual conversation, to anyone who wanted to speak to me and not on the topics I want to speak. I was there to listen.” She added: “I was there not to make any woman unhappy or distressed. I was there to speak to everyone in the community that wanted to have a conversation with me. “Certainly, anyone could have approached me, including, if they wanted to, women accessing the clinic. It was up to them and I was there to listen to them, not to try and convince them at all. I was just there for everyone just to talk to me.” When asked if she was there to try to get the women to change their minds, she said: “No, absolutely not.” Tossici-Bolt’s lawyer, Jeremiah Igunnubole, said he and his team were “exploring all legal options”. “We need to look very closely at the legal decision made yesterday and also the prosecution costs of £20,000 that has been imposed on Livia,” Igunnubole told the Today programme. “This is unprecedented circumstances; never before have we seen entirely peaceful conduct criminalised for nothing other than offering a consensual conversation.” A delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, met Tossici-Bolt last month during a visit to the UK. They were accompanied by a US-backed anti-abortion group, which had been supporting her case. In a post on X hours after the conviction on Friday, the DRL said: “We are disappointed with the UK court’s conviction of Livia Tossici-Bolt for violating a designated ‘buffer zone’ at an abortion clinic. Freedom of expression must be protected for all.” After the verdict, the chief executive of BPAS, Heidi Stewart, said: “The clinic in Bournemouth has been subjected to decades of anti-abortion protests which resulted in more than 500 reports of harassment before this local safe access zone was brought into force. “This case was never about global politics but about the simple ability of women to access legal healthcare free from harassment.”","2025-04-05T13:44:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/anti-abortion-campaigner-bournemouth-conviction"
"abortion","JD Vance may disagree, but this anti-abortion activist isn’t a brutally censored dissident","You know the feeling: you’re feeling sociable, why wouldn’t you make a sign saying “Here to talk, if you want to”, and head for a spot outside the nearest abortion clinic? And why wouldn’t some of its arriving patients want to pause before their appointments and satisfy your entirely innocent interest in their reproductive intentions? This, give or take, amounted to the case by the prominent anti-abortion campaigner, Livia Tossici-Bolt, who was on Friday found guilty of twice breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). Her sign-holding outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic was, she had argued, not covered by a council-imposed safe zone, being “a mere invitation to speak”. And thus an invitation she could have happily extended to strangers just a little further from the clinic. But that did not suit Tossici-Bolt’s purpose. Nor does anything prevent her from staging anti-abortion rallies, distributing literature, or expressing her views on abortion anywhere except right in abortion patients’ faces outside clinics. These details, although similar regulations exist in parts of the US, routinely fail to surface in accounts by her prominent US supporters, with whose help Tossici-Bolt has been misrepresenting the illegal undermining of UK women’s reproductive rights as a noble quest for free speech. Joining with JD Vance, and US anti-abortion pressure group Alliance Defending Freedom (whose UK arm supported her legal defence), a bureau within the US State Department generously took time away from domestic free speech crises to send a delegation to meet Tossici-Bolt. It then tweeted what was generally understood as menacing, that it was “monitoring” her case. “It is important that the UK respect and protect freedom of expression.” A similar admonition, tagging those twin objects of Trump’s esteem, Putin and Viktor Orbán, is expected any time. Would the State Department also be “monitoring” the protection from harassment of women seeking medical treatment, which is the right the UK government was finally, after increasing harassment outside abortion clinics, compelled to balance with anti-abortion campaigners’ freedom to distress them? On the contrary. Pre-tariffs, the Telegraph attributed to some unnamed US imperialist the threatening statement “no free trade without free speech”, as if, such is current US hubris, British women can no longer expect their reproductive choices to escape Trump’s patriarchal reach. After Tossici-Bolt, the addition of an abortion multiplier to the existing tariff formula cannot be ruled out. Nor, now a British district judge, Orla Austin, has brazenly put domestic law before clear US instructions, can the bombing of, if not all of Dorset, at least Poole’s unruly magistrates court. She found Tossici-Bolt had breached a buffer zone, and was ordered to pay £20,026 in costs with a two-year conditional discharge. Generously, you might think, Austin said Tossici-Bolt “lacked insight” into the impact of her actions. If so, the activist, who leads a local branch of 40 Days for Life, appears to have learned little from her years of protests, which include a failed legal challenge to the Bournemouth buffer zone and a submission against legal abortion in Northern Ireland. That general restrictions outside abortion clinics have, after years of disruption, finally been imposed is, of course, purely because of the distress increasingly inflicted on their clients by anti-abortion activists. In the absence of safe zones, patients have been tormented with anything from abuse, spitting and challenges, to foetus pictures and activists striking attitudes indicating “silent prayer”. You might think, from outside the clinic-harassing community, that prayer location means little to an all-seeing God, but with a What3Words precision that might, if only theologians would investigate, account for unsatisfactory responses over thousands of years, experienced anti-abortion nuisances insist that these communications be transmitted on site. Maybe the signal is better there. Though in the case of the Bournemouth-based anti-abortion campaigner, Adam Smith-Connor, it was more convenience that dictated silent prayer outside a clinic (the one also haunted by Tossici-Bolt) quite unrelated to the northern provider where he regretted an abortion of 24 years ago. “It is not practical for me to go to Leeds,” he told a court in 2022, “so I go to a more local location to pray because my son lost his life within an abortion facility.” He received a two-year conditional discharge for breaching the PSPO with an order to pay £9,000 in costs. In this way, Smith-Connor has also converted himself, as is evidently the way forward for anti-abortion campaigners in predominantly abortion-tolerant societies, into the more promising role of brutally censored dissident, Bournemouth’s answer to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. “Thank you VP Vance for defending western values &amp; freedom. I salute you sir”, Smith-Connor tweeted after Vance had surprised his audience at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that seemed better calculated to please anti-abortion fanatics. Maybe the ADF got one about the defence legacy of the cold war? By way of illustrating free speech in peril, Vance selected first, as the most shocking censorship, the fining of Bournemouth man Smith-Connor for breaching buffer zone regulations. Second, lurching into fiction, he claimed Scottish residents in buffer zones had received letters warning that “even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. Not satisfied with this, Vance continued: “Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe.” Eh? You gathered that even if lying is wrong, it’s less wrong than missing the chance, as in this speech, to urge foreign opponents of abortion, by reinventing the intimidation of women as freedom, to go for a US-style assault on reproductive rights. And sure enough, St Livia of the harmless placards has called her conviction a “dark day for freedom”. And to the extent that it provokes the White House into further meddling with British women’s rights, she might, appallingly, be right. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"abortion","Trump rescinds guidance protecting women in need of emergency abortions","The Trump administration on Tuesday rescinded Biden-era guidance clarifying that hospitals in states with abortion bans cannot turn away pregnant patients who are in the midst of medical emergencies – a move that comes amid multiple red-state court battles over the guidance. The guidance deals with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala), which requires hospitals to stabilize patients facing medical emergencies. States such as Idaho and Texas have argued that the Biden administration’s guidance, which it issued in the wake of the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, interpreted Emtala incorrectly. In its letter rescinding the guidance, the Trump administration said that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) “will continue to enforce Emtala, which protects all individuals who present to a hospital emergency department seeking examination or treatment, including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy. CMS will work to rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration’s actions.” Abortion rights supporters said on Tuesday that rescinding the Biden administration’s guidance will muddy hospitals’ ability to interpret Emtala and endanger pregnant patients’ lives. Since Roe’s collapse, dozens of women have come forward to say that they were denied medical treatment due to abortion bans. A reported five pregnant women have died after having their care denied or delayed, or being unable to access legal abortions. “This action sends a clear message: the lives and health of pregnant people are not worth protecting,” Dr Jamila Perritt, an OB-GYN and the president of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement. “Complying with this law can mean the difference between life and death for pregnant people, forcing providers like me to choose between caring for someone in their time of need and turning my back on them to comply with cruel and dangerous laws.” Last year, the US supreme court heard arguments in a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, which at the time only allowed abortions in cases where a woman’s life was at risk. In contrast, most state abortion bans permit abortions when a patient’s “health” is in danger – a lower standard that could make it easier for doctors to intervene. Idaho’s standard, the Biden administration said, blocked doctors from providing abortions in some emergencies and thus violated Emtala’s requirement that hospitals must stabilize patients. Ultimately, the supreme court punted on the issue by ruling 6-3 on procedural grounds that the case had been “improvidently granted”, indicating they should have never taken it up in the first place. “This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation and we have squandered it,” wrote Ketanji Brown Jackson, the supreme court justice, at the time. “And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas and elsewhere will be paying the price.” The Trump administration’s Tuesday move is not unexpected. In March, the administration moved to drop out of the case over the Idaho abortion ban. A local Idaho hospital later filed its own lawsuit over the ban.","2025-06-03T20:00:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/03/trump-admin-emergency-abortion-emtala"
"abortion","‘There’s no other solution’: Polish abortion centre opens in challenge to strict laws","They poured on to streets across Poland in their hundreds of thousands, carrying placards reading “The revolution has a uterus” and “My body, my choice”. In late 2023 they helped vote in a prime minister who promised a swift overhaul of the country’s draconian abortion laws. Now, after more than a year of stalled promises, Polish abortion campaigners are taking matters into their own hands, setting up a pregnancy termination centre on one of the country’s corridors of power. “We want this place to be in TripAdvisor, telling people you have to see this place in Warsaw,” said Natalia Broniarczyk, of the NGO Abortion Dream Team. “Because this is the first abortion centre in democratic Poland.” The centre is due to open its doors on Saturday, offering a safe space for people to ask questions and consult on abortion options. Each interaction will be tailored to the needs of those who enter: some will walk out with information, others may receive pointers on how to obtain abortion pills or be given the option to remain in the centre and receive support while they take the pill. Located a stone’s throw from parliament and the headquarters of the ruling Civic Coalition, the centre is a direct challenge to the country’s near total ban on abortion. “It’s symbolic. Wiejska Street is the most important street in Warsaw. The most important decisions are being taken there – now on abortions too,” Broniarczyk said. It remains to be seen how officials will respond. While the possession or ingestion of abortion pills is not outlawed in Poland, provision of the medication or helping someone to obtain it is considered a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. “What we’re doing could be recognised as illegal,” said Justyna Wydrzyńska, of Abortion Dream Team, which has long provided Polish women with information and support, including pointers on how to acquire the abortion pill. “But this government is not responding to the needs of women. And this is a risk to health and life. So we have to react and there’s no other solution than to help people.” In the run-up to the 2023 election, the now prime minister, Donald Tusk, vowed that his Civic Coalition would liberalise abortion laws within 100 days of being elected. More than 500 days later, the near total ban remains in place. In August, Tusk conceded that the election result meant there was “simply no majority” to change the laws to allow abortions until the 12th week of pregnancy. His party later said efforts to relax the laws would resume after presidential elections due in May. However, Tusk added a line that hinted how things might be different under his government. “I can only promise that within the framework of the existing law we will do everything to make women suffer less, to make abortion as safe as possible and accessible when a woman has to make such a decision. So that people who get involved in helping a woman are not prosecuted,” he said. Those at Abortion Dream Team seized on his words, announcing their plans for the centre and launching a crowdfunding campaign soon after. Months later, their vision is set to become reality. Four staff members have been hired to consult anyone who walks through door, offering a free service that will be funded by donations and sales of merchandise at the centre. “We want to show politicians that the difference between us and them is that we want to provide abortion and they don’t want to,” Broniarczyk said. “So we want to challenge them and show them that we’re not doing anything wrong. And we have only one ask: stop prosecuting us.” The organisation has long wrestled with the nuances of the law. After years of evading the law by referring women who sought abortions to organisations based abroad, in 2022 Wydrzyńska became the country’s first pro-choice activist to be charged with breaking the law, after she provided miscarriage-inducing tablets to a pregnant woman. Last month a judge ordered a retrial in the case. Broniarczyk and Wydrzyńska are confident that the centre will not be immediately shut down. Instead, Broniarczyk worries that authorities will quietly work behind the scenes to complicate their efforts, by hauling them in for regular police questioning or portraying them as “crazy, radical women” to downplay one of the country’s flashpoints. She waved off concerns about protesters, pointing to the centre’s location. “This is the most protected street in Warsaw. We are surrounded by soldiers,” she said. For Wydrzyńska, the biggest worry is that nobody will show up, potentially turned off by protesters or onlookers gathered outside the centre. Otherwise they are ready for whatever else may come. “We’ve been doing this for 20 years, so we know what we’re doing,” Wydrzyńska said. “We know that we are this group who is pushing the limits, who is checking how society will react, what politicians will do. And we’re always happy to start the conversation.”","2025-03-07T05:00:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/polish-abortion-centre-opens-strict-laws-warsaw"
"abortion","Trump signs order to reinstate ‘global gag rule’ on abortion aid","Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order reinstating a federal rule known as the “Mexico City policy” which halts US aid from flowing to groups that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for abortion rights overseas. The policy, which was first instituted by Ronald Reagan in 1984, is typically implemented whenever a Republican president wins the White House and rescinded whenever a Democrat wins. But this whiplash has major implications for abortion and reproductive healthcare around the world. Historically, the revival of the Mexico City policy affects up to about $600m of international aid. During his first term, however, Trump dramatically expanded the scope of the Mexico city policy, which abortion rights supporters call a “global gag rule”. Rather than applying the policy only to family planning assistance, as was typical, the Trump administration applied to it to assistance for organizations that offer a range of health services around the globe – leading the policy to affect billions of dollars’ worth of aid. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions and their impact, the policy can cut off access to contraception, lead women to seek out unsafe abortions and cause tumult within the non-governmental groups that depend on US aid to keep their programs going. “Reinstating the Mexico City policy will have deadly consequences for people across the globe,” Rebecca Hart Holder, president of Reproductive Equity Now, said in a statement. “The United States is a vital partner to healthcare providers and organizations around the world, and robbing those frontline providers of their ability to provide the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare, and even information about people’s options, will result in people losing their lives to pregnancy complications.” Trump also signed a second executive order affirming a longstanding US policy that prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortions. That order also rolled back two executive orders penned by Joe Biden, which sought to protect abortion access in the wake of the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade. The fall of Roe led a wave of states to ban the procedure. Trump’s executive orders arrived hours after he sent a pre-recorded message to the protesters who attended the March for Life, the nation’s largest anti-abortion gathering, in Washington on Friday afternoon. His vice president, JD Vance, addressed the March in person. “With the inauguration on Monday, our country faces the return of the most pro-family, most pro-life American president of our lifetimes,” Vance told the crowd, to massive cheers. Abortion rights supporters had anticipated the return of the Mexico City policy, but are still awaiting news on whether Trump will allow widespread enforcement of the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that could be used to effectively ban abortion nationwide. Although abortion rights remain extremely popular in the US, Vance and Trump’s appearances at the March are a sign of the anti-abortion movement’s political firepower and diehard grip on the GOP. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, and speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, also spoke at the March – marking the first time in the March’s 50-year-plus history that the leaders of both chambers of Congress had ever done so.","2025-01-25T01:44:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/trump-order-abortion"
"abortion","Trigger warnings may do more harm than good. Witness ‘the abortion play’","If your Valentine disappointed you this weekend, spare a thought for the protagonist of The Years, the explosive West End play based on the writings of the French novelist and Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux. A teenager is thrilled to discover she has attracted the temporary attention of an older man at summer camp. After he painfully takes her virginity, she gradually realises that he has told half the resort. She finds the word “whore” scribbled across her bathroom mirror. Still she yearns for the validation of his returning desire. The play takes as its subject the full range of life experiences contingent on embodied womanhood. Like the Ernaux memoir from which it draws its name, its heroine tells her story in the plural “we” and speaks for a generation of war-born French women. To the frustration of its artists, however, one of those experiences has captured all the headlines. In a sequence set in the early 1960s a student obtains an illegal abortion. Trigger warnings plaster the walls, website and email communications of the Harold Pinter theatre. These warnings have failed to prevent a nightly sequence in which patrons faint in the aisles, the play is halted and unconscious theatregoers are carried from their seats. The Years deserves to be recognised as a rare achievement: a hit drama that captures a lifetime of female experiences. Instead, to casual observers, it has become “the abortion play”. Last month, when I interviewed its director, Eline Arbo, she lifted the lid on something few British directors are prepared to admit: trigger warnings may be doing more harm than good. Arbo is Norwegian, trained in the Netherlands and now runs the landmark Internationaal Theater Amsterdam: The Years was created for a Dutch cast and widely toured in the Netherlands. The first run used no trigger warnings. In each successive transfer, warnings have increased, as have the fainting fits, which seem to border on mass hysteria. “My experience is that there’s more reactions than if you don’t have these,” Arbo told me. Arriving at current performances of the show, the audience “are so aware of it that it enhances the feeling of uncomfortableness”. A wealth of academic studies support Arbo’s case. Twelve of these studies were drawn together in a 2023 comparative analysis led by Victoria Bridgland of Flinders University, which concluded that “warnings reliably increased anticipatory affect”. In other words, “viewing a trigger warning appears to increase anticipatory anxiety prior to viewing content”, measured by rapidly rising heart rates and aggravated medical distress. Bridgland and her colleagues did not endorse the conservative argument that these prevent students from learning: they concluded that “trigger warnings do not seem to impair or enhance the comprehension of educational material”. If anything, they seem to attract readers, viewers and audiences – even those with trauma histories. We actively choose the thrill of forbidden fruit. My differing visits to The Years bear this out. Last August, the English-language production premiered at the Almeida theatre in London; on press night, there were some warnings but no gory rumours in advance, and no hysteria. The scene draws its impact both from the language of its storytelling – performed as a monologue by Romola Garai – and an eventual gush of blood emerging from between her legs. If you menstruate, there is nothing new here. Some men, it seems, have had very sheltered lives. The scene is affective, particularly in the final moments in which Garai describes the heartbroken and secretive disposal of the foetus. This material is drawn from Ernaux’s short autofiction work The Happening, here incorporated by Arbo into a broader narrative drawn from Ernaux’s The Years. One of the elements made more explicit in The Happening than the play is that months pass while its protagonist is forced to hunt for a provider of illegal abortion. The criminalisation of the procedure thus exacerbates the medical and moral consequences. Yet, when I returned to the play, now transferred to the West End and the subject of such discussion, protest and press coverage, you could cut the audience’s anticipatory anxiety with a knife. The sequence takes time to reach its emotive moments: Garai’s character talks us through her first suspicions of pregnancy before we get anywhere near the word “abortion”. The man sitting in front of me, however, had tensed his shoulders to his ears the moment Garai walked on stage. When her character mentioned she had skipped a period, his breathing was already shallow and broken. Before we had reached the sight of blood, he had keeled over. Soon, he was being evacuated limp and inert from the auditorium, his companion shouting for an ambulance. He was not the only one. Fortunately, he didn’t need that ambulance: a paramedic is on site at all performances, and he made a quick recovery. The production team are clearly concerned to protect audiences, staff and their own liabilities: I’ve never seen a front of house team so smoothly trained and the full company have received support from the mental health charity Applause for Thought. One wonders, however, if that concern for liability has driven the ever-escalating cascade of warnings I received before entrusting my psyche to the care of Arbo and her artists. As she told me, speaking perhaps more generally of theatreland, official warnings are “the theatre’s way of giving an excuse for itself”. You can’t go to the loo at the Harold Pinter without being reminded of them. The problem is that trigger warnings are now a sacred cow in the arts. Arbo is a visitor here, but it is career suicide for a progressive director in London to question their value. It doesn’t help that conservatives use the question as a wedge issue on which to pour scorn on “snowflakes” and mock any call for empathy. No one, least of all Arbo, wants to retrigger trauma in the theatre. But amid all this language of concern, we have forgotten that PTSD is rarely triggered by exposure to content that mirrors factual elements of our memories. The person in my life who has PTSD from combat experience can watch war movies without issue. His PTSD – debilitating, medically diagnosed and not something I would wish on anyone – is triggered only by a very specific taste in the mouth, which no one theatre director could possibly predict or warn for. Science tells us that trauma is real: its triggers are as varied as human experience. There is no consensus on whether men or women are more likely to faint in The Years. What is clear is that the play offers us a rare chance to see women’s lives and bodies on stage, with honesty. It deserves to make the trip to Broadway, where the horror of backstreet abortion is a revived reality – although I wonder what Americans will make of its European honesty about masturbation. Its slew of trigger warnings may help some people but they have also served to sensationalise and disrupt the mundane reality of the women’s stories at its heart. • Kate Maltby writes about theatre, politics and culture","2025-02-15T09:00:32Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/15/trigger-warnings-dont-help-ptsd-but-they-do-a-lot-to-raise-peoples-expectations"
"abortion","Republicans wanted fewer abortions and more births. They are getting the opposite","Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the US supreme court case that rescinded the constitutional right to abortion, is failing on its own terms. Since the ruling, in June 2022, the number of abortions in the US has risen. Support for reproductive rights is on the upswing. And the rate of voluntary sterilization among young women – a repudiation of Trumpian pronatalism, if a desperate one – jumped abruptly after Dobbs, and there’s no reason to believe it will drop off. Also rising at an alarming clip are preventable maternal deaths and criminal prosecutions of pregnant people. Yet the 21 state legislatures that have imposed total or near-total bans are doing little or nothing to give doctors legal leeway to save the health and lives of pregnant women in medical distress, even if that means inducing abortion. In fact, rather than trying to save lives, they are prosecuting pregnant people who handle those emergencies on their own. The first three – more abortions, more pro-abortion sentiment, more contraception –have frustrated the anti-abortion crowd no end. They know they need stronger disincentives to abortion. Which brings us to the latter two: more punishment and more death. Was punishment the aim all along? And has the anti-abortion movement accepted pregnant people’s deaths as an unfortunate consequence of saving the pre-born? According to the Guttmacher Institute, abortions rose 1.5% in 2024 from 2023, on top of a 11.1% leap in the first year after Dobbs, compared with 2020, before the near-bans enacted in several states that presaged the ruling. It’s also probably an undercount. The statistics include only “clinician-provided abortions”, either surgical or medical (using abortion pills), performed in healthcare facilities or via telemedicine. Guttmacher does not estimate how many abortions are happening outside the formal healthcare system, with drugs obtained directly from suppliers or through feminist underground networks. Indeed, Plan C, the country’s biggest clearinghouse for pill access, reports 2m visits to its website and 500,000 click-throughs to resources and care in 2024, a 25% increase from the year before. How many of those people ended their pregnancies at home, with only a friend or lover in attendance? Anecdotal evidence gleaned from activists suggests they number in the tens of thousands. At the same time, rather than making abortion “unthinkable”, as the anti-abortion activists pledge, the bans may be having the opposite effect. An analysis of two restrictive states, Arizona and Wisconsin, and one with broad access, New Jersey, found that negative attitudes toward abortion are down and positive ones up, in both red and blue states. And if the goal of banning abortion is to produce more children, that’s not working either. Public health researchers saw “an abrupt increase in permanent contraception procedures” – sterilization – following Dobbs among adults in their prime reproductive years, ages 18 to 30. Unsurprisingly, the increase in procedures for women (tubal ligations) was twice that for men (vasectomies). The Trump administration is cheerleading for procreation. “I want more babies in the United States of America,” declared JD Vance in his first public appearance as vice-president, at the March for Life in Washington. He blamed the declining birth rate on “a culture of abortion on demand” and the failure “to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life”. The federal budget extends some of that help. It raises the annual child tax credit (CTC) from $2,000 to $2,200. It also creates “Trump accounts”, $1,000 per child, which parents or employers can add to. But only those with social security numbers are eligible for either program; the tax credit is available only to people who earn enough to pay taxes; and as with any investment, those able to sow more in the savings accounts reap more. It’s clear what sort of baby the administration wishes to be born: white babies with “American” parents, and not the poorest. The carrots are not appetizing enough. The stick is not effective enough. So red-state legislators and prosecutors are ramping up the punitive approach. This year, Republican lawmakers in at least 10 states introduced bills defining abortion as homicide, and, for the first time, criminalizing both the provider and the patient. No such bill has passed – yet – and anti-abortion organizations are usually quick to renounce them publicly, nervous about widespread opposition. But their passage might not be far off. The bills are based on fetal personhood – the concept of conferring full legal rights to a fetus from conception forward. The idea was introduced in 1884 and finally written into one state’s law in 1986. By 2024, 39 states had fetal homicide laws. Last year, there were three bills criminalizing the person who has an abortion; now there are 10. And though the federal courts rejected fetal personhood for a century, it is the bedrock of anti-abortion politics, and this US supreme court is looking much more friendly toward it. While they work toward straightforward criminalization of ending one’s own pregnancy, anti-abortion lawmakers and prosecutors are making creative use of existing law to punish miscarriage, an event indistinguishable from elective abortion, just in case the pregnant person induced the miscarriage. The most ghoulish is the prohibition on abusing corpses. For instance: last week a 31-year-old South Carolina woman who miscarried and disposed of the tissue in the trash was arrested for “desecration of human remains”, a crime carrying a 10-year sentence. In March, a woman found bleeding outside her Georgia apartment after a miscarriage was jailed for “concealing the death of another person” and “abandonment of a dead body” for placing the remains in the bin. A week before that, a Pennsylvania teenager was under investigation for corpse abuse after a self-managed pill abortion and burial of the fetus in her yard. In a grim sense, these are the lucky ones: they survived. Because Dobbs has indisputably been deadly. “Mothers living in states that banned abortion were nearly twice as likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth, or soon after giving birth” as mothers living in states where abortion was legal and accessible, reports the Gender Equity Policy Institute. Maternal mortality rose 56% in Texas after it enacted a six-week ban; a Texan’s risk was one and a half times that of a Californian’s. The future isn’t sunny. A study of 14 total-ban states predicts that in the four years beginning a year after Dobbs, up to 42 mothers will die and as many as 2,700 will be afflicted with “severe maternal morbidity”, defined by the CDC as “unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short-term or long-term [health] consequences”. In one analysis Black women represented 63% of the deaths. The anti-abortion movement is indefatigable. “We abolishioners will not rest until we have effected the abolishment of human abortion,” one leader told Oklahoma Voice. But this is an unattainable grail. Where abortion is illegal, people still have abortions. They just take more risks. Globally, more than 39,000 women die yearly from unsafe abortions. As they run out of options, red-state lawmakers will harden criminal penalties against people who refuse to give up their reproductive self-determination. It may grow less outré to endorse Trump’s opinion, expressed in an unguarded moment, that women who get illegal abortions “deserve some form of punishment”. Whether intentional or not, the sentence for some of those women will be death. Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

"abortion","Arrested at gunpoint, charged as a felon: a midwife’s lot in anti-abortion Texas","The abortion arrests have started Texas is a fairly decent place to be an armadillo (they’re the official state small mammal) and an increasingly dire place to be a woman. In 2021, it implemented a near-total abortion ban: the most radical abortion law in the US. Now it’s going even further in its crusade to outlaw abortion. On Monday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced the first criminal charges under Texas’s abortion ban. Maria Margarita Rojas, a licensed midwife, was charged with the illegal performance of an abortion and with practicing medicine without a license, according to a press release from Paxton’s office. Her employee Jose Ley was also charged. There are still a lot of details that are unclear or unverified when it comes to this case, which apparently caught officials’ eyes after an anonymous tip-off. But I’ll tell you what is glaringly apparent: Texas wants to make an example of Rojas. They want Rojas, who primarily served a low-income Spanish-speaking community, to be a cautionary tale. One that ensures people are too terrified to even think about helping a woman obtain an abortion. Rojas isn’t getting some sort of slap on the wrist; the full force of the state is coming after her. She was reportedly pulled over by police at gunpoint while on her way to a clinic and the abortion charge is a second-degree felony, which comes with up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, according to the Texas Tribune, the state recommended Rojas and Ley each be held on a million-dollar bond. A million dollars! (In the end, a judge ordered their bonds each be set at $500,000 for the abortion-related charges and $200,000 for the medical license charges.) To put this in perspective, a Texas elementary school teacher arrested earlier this month after a “large quantity” of child sexual abuse materials was reportedly found on his devices, is being held in jail on a $75,000 bond. Locking up doctors isn’t a popular policy platform – according to a 2024 KFF poll, eight in 10 Democrats, two-thirds of independents and about half of Republicans want to protect doctors who perform abortions from facing either fines or prison time. Which seems to be why Paxton went after a midwife. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and leading authority on the legal history of the American abortion debate, notes in Slate that “this is almost certainly not the first prosecution that Paxton could have brought”. No, it looks like Paxton was trying to find the perfect victim: someone he could easily smear. “The fact that Rojas is not a physician is central to Paxton’s strategy,” Ziegler writes. “He claims that the prosecution will protect women from unlicensed and presumably unsafe providers … [he wants] to signal that midwives who provide abortions are unsafe, unqualified, and dishonest.” This attack on the credibility of midwives – particularly non-white midwives – isn’t new. The Guardian notes that: “As abortion bans spread across the country in the 19th century, midwives were often driven out of work or faced criminal consequences, which in turn led white, male doctors to siphon up their patients and dominate the medical field.” Some observers believe that the timing of all this is also strategic. Abortion activist Jessica Valenti (who used to write this newsletter and now writes Abortion, Every Day) has noted that Rojas was arrested weeks ago. Why did Paxton wait until now to send out a press release? Valenti reckons he is trying to distract from the fact that Texas Republicans are trying to push through SB 2880, which she characterizes as the biggest piece of anti-abortion legislation since Roe was overturned. This bill targets Texans’ access to abortion pills and makes it easier to sue people and companies involved in a person’s medication abortion. The bill also protects “any person who impregnated the woman who used abortion-inducing drugs through conduct constituting sexual assault” from being sued. “Flooding the zone” – a strategy put forward by Steve Bannon to describe the process of overwhelming the media by creating more news than anyone can possibly follow – is very much part of the Republican playbook. But, at this point, I don’t know whether anti-abortion activists really care about distracting us from all the dystopian schemes they’ve got up their sleeves. On the contrary, they seem eager to rub their cruelty in our faces. Still, amid the unceasing torrent of news, it is true that we must stay focused. We must remember that the arrest of Rojas and Ley isn’t some sort of one-off isolated to Texas but part of a much broader attack on reproductive rights. Don’t listen to Donald Trump’s “reassurances” that abortion rights should be left to the states to decide: the eventual goal is to end abortion access entirely. Elon Musk’s dad says his son was friendly with their Black servants growing up The Washington Post recently did a deep dive into why Elon has become obsessed with anti-DEI efforts. While Musk, who is busy dismantling the country, didn’t speak to the Post, his estranged dad, Errol (the one who has two children with his former stepdaughter), did send an email where he provided some information on Elon and his younger brother’s childhood. “We had several black servants who were their friends,” Errol noted in defence of his fascist-salute-enthusiast son.

Please watch this heartbreaking video from CNN where eight-year-old Sama Tubail, who has lost all her hair from stress, says: “I want to die and have my hair grow in paradise.” The UN has said “a generation has been traumatized”, and that nearly all of Gaza’s 1.2 million children need psychological support. If you’re American, your taxpayer dollars are funding this, your lawmakers are enabling this, large swathes of the media are justifying this, and you can lose your job for speaking up about this.

"abortion","Texas lawmakers take aim at abortion pills in new legislative session","As the Texas legislature convenes in Austin on Tuesday for the first day of its 2025 session, a number of anti-abortion bills have already been filed, largely aimed at halting the flow of abortion pills into the state. The bills were crafted to stop what is widely viewed as a loophole in abortion bans across the country, as pills have helped mitigate the impact of the bans now dotting the US. Texas Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion advocacy group, has had a hand in drafting a number of the bills, and is encouraging men to sue people who have supported their partners’ abortions. “There hasn’t been any real accountability when it comes to abortion pill access, so we are going to try several different approaches to give Texans more tools to end this deadly trend,” said John Seago, president of Texas Right to Life. Texas was the first state in the US to ban most abortions in recent years, passing a six-week ban that went into effect months before the fall of Roe v Wade. Following the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe, the state enacted a total ban that threatens doctors with up to life in prison. Texas often serves as a laboratory for anti-abortion bills and strategies that other Republican-led states later replicate. While a Texas law already criminalizes sending abortion pills to its residents by mail, it has been difficult to enforce. An average of 2,800 abortions a month are still obtained in Texas through so-called shield laws that were passed in a number of blue states to offer protection to providers who prescribe to women in states with bans. Other abortions are self-managed with help from pills supplied through underground networks. These channels have been sources of ongoing frustration for anti-abortion activists who see the mail-order route as a final loophole that needs closing. Texas Republicans pre-filed several bills to target pills. One would make it a “deceptive trade practice” to send pills via mail without a prescription from an in-state doctor after an in-person exam. Similar to a measure in Louisiana that doctors warn will delay life-saving care, another would reclassify abortion drugs as dangerous “controlled substances”. Yet another bill would allow citizens to file lawsuits that force internet service providers to block websites that host abortion funds – organizations that help people seeking abortion travel out of state – or provide information about obtaining abortion pills. The bill specifically names groups that offer abortion medication through the mail, including Aid Access, Plan C and Hey Jane. That bill seeks to use a novel enforcement mechanism written into the 2021 ban – termed a “private bounty-hunter scheme” by the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor – which allowed citizens to sue anyone they suspected of facilitating an abortion. “It also brings up the issue of Texas potentially projecting its power outside of state lines to regulate speech about abortion and that could get very complicated,” said Mary Ziegler, law professor at University of California-Davis and abortion law historian. Emboldened by the incoming Trump administration, Texas anti-abortion advocates feel optimistic that their plans will come to fruition following a relatively quiet session on abortion in 2023. But even if some of the bills pass, they will probably be met with court challenges. “With some of these efforts to block out-of-state abortion pills by mail the courts will need to first resolve the question of cross-border legal conflicts,” Ziegler said. “Whose state laws are going to apply in these scenarios? And that’s going to be messy.” *** Texas Right to Life says blocking residents from receiving abortion-inducing medication is the group’s top priority this year. The influential group is also encouraging men to file wrongful death lawsuits against organizations and doctors that help facilitate their partners’ abortions. Such a suit was filed in March 2023 by Texas resident Marcus Silva against his ex-wife’s friends for allegedly assisting in her medication abortion. Silva quietly dropped the case in October. The group says it is working with ministries, “abortion recovery groups” and crisis pregnancy centers around the state to find plaintiffs and that it hopes to file the first such lawsuit by February. “Several men around Texas who are fathers of abortion victims are very, very interested in holding these individuals accountable. And we are working to enable that,” said Seago. “The ultimate goal is to expose these activists and send a message that they will be held responsible to deter them from operating.” In December, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued a New York doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Texas woman, setting up a battle that tests the endurance of shield laws. This session, Paxton could get a boost in his crusade to criminalize abortion with another bill, HB 1004, which would empower the AG to unilaterally prosecute abortion-related offenses. Meanwhile, Democrats have filed bills to help doctors navigate the law by clarifying the medical exceptions to the state’s abortion bans and allowing them to use their best medical judgment when treating patients. They have also suggested measures to carve out rape and incest exceptions in Texas abortion law. Neither bill is expected to pass as the legislature is under Republican control.","2025-01-14T14:00:55Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/texas-anti-abortion-bills-filed"
"abortion","Unsafe abortions and no antenatal care: aid cuts hit women hardest in one of Africa’s poorest countries","A blue, burgundy and white patterned wrapper hides the swell of Joanna Banda’s belly. Eight months pregnant, she has had just three of the five antenatal appointments she should have had. She is unlikely to attend her final three either, as she still has to save 3,000 kwacha (£1.28) for a bicycle to take her six miles on rutted dirt tracks to the nearest health centre when she goes into labour. In remote villages in Malawi, pregnant women such as 22-year-old Banda, who has one child after losing her first soon after giving birth, are struggling to get the medical care they need. In January, US aid cuts abruptly ended a rural healthcare outreach programme that was starting to reduce the number of local women dying in childbirth. Momentum Tikweze Umoyo, a five-year $28m (£20m) programme aimed at cutting maternal and infant mortality rates in five of Malawi’s 28 districts, was meant to last until 2027. It is just one of the many casualties of Donald Trump’s decision to suspend foreign aid just hours after taking office in January, risking the lives of some of the world’s poorest, most vulnerable people. In July, Congress approved $9bn in cuts to aid and public broadcasting. Last month, the US president said he would be cancelling $4.9bn in aid already approved by Congress. Kafulatira, where Banda lives, is a village of scattered mud huts with almost 1,000 people in Salima district, east of the capital, Lilongwe. There is no piped water or electricity, and a bridge across the steep-banked river that divides it from the nearest health centre was washed away last December. A mobile clinic used to visit the community every month or so, providing a private space for women to get screening for cervical and other cancers, HIV tests and treatment, and vaccinations for children. It also provided antenatal checkups and family-planning services, including contraception. “The outreach clinics were helping a lot, because we could access services right here in the village,” Mulirani Gerard says through a translator. “Since last year, we had been waiting for the team to come, so we were just wondering what had happened.” No one told villagers why their healthcare had been cut. Gerard says she has not been too badly affected, as she has a contraceptive implant that lasts for three years, but that others were not so lucky. “It’s a challenge, because this has led to unintended pregnancies,” the 25-year-old says, pointing to her friend Banda, as they sit in the shade with other mothers as children play around them. Juliette Kannda, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been receiving bi-monthly contraceptive injections. Now, she says, she is saving up 10,000 kwacha for the 25-mile round trip to another health centre. “I am looking forward to getting the [contraceptive] implant, considering the distances I travel to access services,” she says. Malawi is one of the world’s poorest countries. In 2024, the landlocked southern African country had an income of just $508 per person, according to the World Bank. It is incredibly vulnerable to the climate crisis: 80% of the population work in agriculture and it has been battered by repeated cyclones and droughts in recent years. The country, of about 22 million people, is also highly dependent on aid. Aid from the US, both grants and low-interest loans, amounted to 2% of the country’s GDP in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund. That compares with an average of 0.5% across sub-Saharan Africa. In 2023, the US accounted for a quarter of all aid sent to Malawi, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The year before that, the Center for Global Development found that US health spending was more than double that of the Malawian government. Malawi’s economy was already in a parlous state before the US aid cuts. For the past three years, inflation has been above 20%, the economy has grown more slowly than the population, and a scarcity of foreign exchange has led to shortages of fuel, fertiliser and medicine. An IFPRI study in April estimated that US aid will fall 59% this year, cutting 1% off Malawi’s GDP. The government had little means to make up the shortfall. Malawi’s fiscal deficit (the gap between government expenditure and revenue) was 10.1% in the year to 31 March. In any case, its attempts to win back voters with election-year spending failed, with Lazarus Chakwera losing to Peter Mutharika in elections on 16 September. Funding healthcare in Malawi “is indeed the duty of the government, but … the government doesn’t have the resources,” says Hester Nyasulu, Malawi director for Amref Health Africa, a organisation that was one of seven backing the Momentum Tikweze Umoyo project. The funding cuts should have been a “transitional process”, he says, adding: “We were starting to reap the benefits of the investment … The termination of the USAID [funds] … will definitely lead to more deaths of pregnant and lactating women and also newborns.” Between January 2022 and December 2024, maternal mortality rates in clinics and hospitals had fallen in three of the five districts covered by the project, according to data provided by Nyasulu. More children were vaccinated, treated for malaria and had their nutrition monitored, and more women received family planning services and first-trimester antenatal care, while teenage pregnancies fell. In Salima district, outreach clinics were held at 87 sites surrounding seven health centres, reaching between three and 10 communities every weekday. The vehicles and staff were provided by the health ministry, with fuel and staff lunches paid for by USAID. At the health centre in Makioni, a small market town about 34 miles from the district capital, breastfeeding guides painted on the wall were branded: “USAID: from the American people”. Staff there lament how pregnant women are having antenatal appointments later or not at all and the drop in screenings for cervical cancer. Two women aged 18 and 20 survived unsafe abortions, which they had undergone because they lived 17 miles from the clinic, staff say. “It’s increased the workload in the [health] facilities, hence the poor quality of services being provided,” says Yohane Billiat, district family-planning coordinator. Samuel Chawaka, the Makioni health centre manager, says: “We are failing to give them services in their place.” A US state department spokesperson said: “The US government supports life-saving assistance in Malawi, including approximately $160m to support efforts to address HIV, TB, malaria and other critical health risks. “America continues to be the most generous nation in the world. It is imperative to remember that the American taxpayer was never meant to bear the full burden of taking care of every person on Earth – whether that be with food, medicine or otherwise.” However, even in Malawi’s cities the quality of healthcare is falling. In Lilongwe, the US previously funded the training of health workers to find and manage cases of tuberculosis (TB). There has subsequently been a fall in the number of cases detected and referred for treatment, says Thoms Chigeda, the district TB coordinator. “If people are not being diagnosed early enough, it will be difficult for them to get cured,” he says, “and drug-resistant TB can also flourish. We had made some strides in the TB fight in the district, but because of this I think we might be losing the battle.” Before the US aid cuts, 11,000 babies were immunised every month, says Maclean Nkhoma, the city’s immunisation coordinator. Now it is fewer than 9,000, and the infant immunisation rate has fallen from 98% to 85%, he says. “They [the US] have been supporting us; they have to continue. Because otherwise whatever happens in Malawi or in Africa, like outbreaks, will also affect them,” Nkhoma says. “If Africa is protected, that means the whole world is protected.”","2025-09-25T06:00:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/05/malawi-global-health-development-us-aid-cuts-tb-contraception-women"
"abortion","What is the new abortion bill in NSW – and why is Tony Abbott trying to stop it?","New South Wales decriminalised abortion in 2019 – but it’s still inaccessible for many people in the state. In February, the Greens NSW spokesperson for health, Dr Amanda Cohn, introduced a new bill in the state’s upper house seeking to amend the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 to improve access to services, particularly in regional and rural parts of the state where there are vast abortion deserts. The bill’s second and third readings last week prompted heated debate in parliament. It also spilled out on to the steps, with an anti-abortion rally attended by prominent campaigners, including the former prime minister Tony Abbott. A watered down version of Cohn’s original bill passed the Legislative Council late Thursday. This week it will move to the Legislative Assembly, with debate expected to begin on Tuesday afternoon, and if passed it will become law. Amid all the loud voices on this issue, what’s the debate around NSW’s abortion law reform actually about? What’s in the NSW abortion bill? Cohn’s Abortion Law Reform Amendment (Health Care Access) Bill 2025 had four key components when it was introduced: Ensure abortion services are provided across the state within a reasonable distance of residents’ homes, and giving the health minister the power to compel public health services to comply with any directions to offer abortion services. Information about access to abortion services also needed to be publicly available; Expand access by allowing nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe medical abortions up to nine weeks gestation; Require practitioners who object to abortion to refer a patient to someone who will provide the service; Remove unnecessary mandatory reporting requirements to give the health ministry information about the termination, which create barriers for practitioners. The bill was passed in the upper house with significant amendments so that only the second component – enabling nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe medical abortion care – would come into law if the bill also passed the lower house. A surgical abortion is a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting, while a medication or medical abortion involves taking prescribed abortion pills. Cohn told Guardian Australia that the bill as originally drafted included a duty for the public health system to provide abortion services. “This is something that can be achieved without legislative change, and the Greens will continue to advocate for services to be funded in public hospitals, as promised by the premier,” she said. Why is the bill being introduced? In December Guardian Australia revealed that just three of NSW’s 220 public hospitals were routinely providing surgical abortions. In response, Cohn said “far too little has changed” since abortion was decriminalised in the state. When Cohn introduced the bill, she said expanding who could perform medical terminations was necessary to bring the state’s legislation in line with changes made by the national medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, in 2023. Cohn said this had been one of three recommendations of the NSW Health review of abortion law published in September. What are the arguments against it? Many members supported the bill but also voted in favour of the amendments on access to abortion care. Penny Sharpe, the leader of the government in the Legislative Council, said she understood “the issue of access is real” but said “legislating this will not fix the problem. We do not legislate to require health ministers to provide cancer services or heart services in this way.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Many Legislative Council members said they opposed Cohn’s bill to strengthen the 2019 legislation for the same reasons they opposed the original law. In the parliamentary debate on the bill last Tuesday, the upper house Liberal MP Chris Rath compared abortion to the Nazi genocide of Jews, arguing “it is bizarre that abortion is increasingly being categorised as a human right to health care”. Rath later told the Sydney Morning Herald in a statement that he regretted and apologised for the insensitive language used. Rath was contacted for comment. How have people outside parliament responded? A rally against the NSW abortion bill was organised last Wednesday night outside the steps of parliament by the anti-abortion campaigner Joanna Howe’s coalition, which was attended by Abbott and the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher. The rally’s poster stated the “NSW Greens have tabled a bill that could force the closure of Christian hospitals and compel all health workers to be involved in abortions” – claims which were echoed by Abbott on Sky News later that evening. Abbott said “trying to force health professionals with a conscientious objection to abortion to facilitate – not just refer – people having abortions, fundamentally it’s designed to force Christian people out of the healthcare system. It’s designed to force Catholic and other Christian hospitals out of the healthcare system, unless they are to sacrifice their principles. It’s really about cancelling faith in our public life.” Cohn had already addressed concerns about the impacts of the part of the original bill on faith‑based hospitals that are part of the public health system. “While I know that there are many people who believe these hospitals should have to provide abortion services, that is actually not what is proposed by this bill,” Cohn said. “The handful of faith-based hospitals in the public system are located in metropolitan areas close to public hospitals, and there would be no reason for the minister to direct these hospitals to do anything to fulfil the requirement that abortion services are available within a reasonable distance of where people live.” Why do the Greens think the bill is needed? Cohn said advocates for women’s rights and reproductive rights have been anxious that hard-fought rights could be eroded, especially with the impact of abortion bans in several US states. “In this context, it’s significant for the NSW parliament to not only uphold, but improve reproductive rights – especially in the face of an organised campaign of disinformation that has caused considerable distress in the community.” She said the change in law to allow nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe medical abortions has the support of the minister and shadow minister for health, as well as NSW Health, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog), Family Planning Australia, the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, and the AMA (NSW). Will it improve access to abortions in NSW? According to medical groups, yes. Dr Gillian Gibson, the president of Ranzcog, said the inclusion of nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives in the provision of early medical abortion is a “safe, evidence-based reform – and a necessary step toward ensuring timely, equitable, and patient-centred access to abortion services for women across NSW”. International evidence from comparable jurisdictions such as Canada showed enabling nurse practitioners and midwives to deliver this care resulted in the frequency of early medical abortions to rise substantially, while the overall abortion rate remained stable because less surgical abortions were needed.","2025-05-13T04:41:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/13/what-is-the-new-abortion-bill-nsw-services-law-reform"
"abortion","Woman, 74, arrested for alleged breach of exclusion zone around Glasgow abortion clinic","Police in Scotland have made the first arrest of a protester who allegedly breached an exclusion zone around an abortion clinic, days after the US vice-president, JD Vance, spread inaccurate claims about Scotland’s rules. The arrest of the 74-year-old woman took place as anti-abortion campaigners funded by the Texas-based group 40 Days for Life announced a fresh wave of protests outside the clinic in Glasgow next month, in defiance of the ban. Scottish politicians said the protesters had been “emboldened” by Vance’s factually inaccurate claim last week that people who lived within an exclusion zone were banned from praying at home. Gillian Mackay, a Scottish Green party MSP who championed the legislation, said: “It’s no coincidence that this has happened so soon after JD Vance and his supporters have spread toxic misinformation about Scotland. It is vital that we stand up for reproductive rights and against those who are working to undermine them.” The act, Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) 2024, passed by the Scottish parliament in June last year, prohibits protests against abortion within a 200-metre (650ft) area around a hospital or clinic which provides abortion services. In an attack on these policies at the Munich Security Conference, Vance said the Scottish and UK governments had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons [in] the crosshairs”. He alleged: “This last October, just a few months ago, the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law.” John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, who regularly attends church, said earlier on Wednesday that Vance’s claims were inaccurate. “JD Vance is just wrong and that issue was extensively discussed during the passage of the bill,” he said. “On the letter issued to households, his claims were wrong about that letter as well, and no such point was put to residents whatsoever on private prayer.” In a statement, Police Scotland said: “We were made aware of a group of protesters having gathered in the Hardgate Road area of Glasgow around 2.05pm on Wednesday 19 February 2025. “Officers attended and a 74-year-old woman was arrested and charged in connection with breach of the exclusion zone.” The force added that she would be reported to prosecutors. The Daily Record newspaper reported that 40 Days for Life activists plan to hold daily demonstrations between 5 March and 13 April outside the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Glasgow on Hardgate Road, where there is an abortion clinic. Swinney said abortion care was a central part of existing health and social care provision in Scotland. “I have no plans to change that,” he added. “It’s part and parcel of the offering we make. The buffer zone legislation was designed to essentially recognise that women accessing those services should be able to do so without any additional sense of pressure.” Mackay said: “We know the awful impact that these protests have had. Some of the testimonies from women who have had to endure them have been heartbreaking. “I urge 40 Days For Life and anyone else who is planning to protest in a safe access zone to think again, as they will be stopped and there will be consequences.”","2025-02-19T18:52:57Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/19/woman-74-arrested-for-alleged-breach-of-exclusion-zone-around-glasgow-abortion-clinic"
"abortion","Judge strikes down Ohio abortion ban as unconstitutional","An Ohio judge has decided that the state’s ban on most abortions was unconstitutional and could not be enforced. Judge Christian Jenkins of the Hamilton county common pleas court also granted a permanent injunction in his ruling on Thursday. Jenkins said that Ohio’s abortion prohibition flouted language in a voter-approved amendment to the state constitution that protected reproductive healthcare. “Ohio voters have spoken. The Ohio constitution now unequivocally protects the right to abortion,” Jenkins said in his ruling. Jenkins’s decision stems from a law that prohibited doctors from performing abortions after the detection of fetal cardiac or embryonic activity. This activity can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy, the Columbus Dispatch reported. While Republican lawmakers in Ohio passed this law in 2019, the legislation did not go into effect until June 2022 – when the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Jenkins temporarily paused the law less than three months after it went into effect. Healthcare providers in Ohio filed suit to permanently end the legislation, as it drove patients to seek reproductive care outside of the state and imperiled several clinics. A young girl who was sexual assaulted in Columbus, Ohio, even had to travel to Indiana for abortion care, spurring still more anger over the measure. Advocates launched a ballot initiative to ensure that reproductive healthcare rights, including abortion, were protected by the state constitution. This campaign passed in November last year, winning 57% of voting Ohioans’ support, the newspaper said. “This is a momentous ruling, showing the power of Ohio’s new Reproductive Freedom Amendment in practice,” Jessie Hill, cooperating attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said. “The six-week ban is blatantly unconstitutional and has no place in our law.” Jenkins’ ruling came several months after another Ohio judge temporarily paused a handful of state laws that instituted a mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving an abortion. David C Young, the Franklin county common pleas judge who made this ruling in August, also said that the state constitutional amendment language protecting abortion was “clear and unambiguous.” Young ruled that lawyers for Preterm Cleveland and healthcare providers who had sued clearly demonstrated “that the challenged statutes burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, and discriminate against patients in exercising their right to an abortion and providers for assisting them in exercising that right”. The state’s attorney general said he will appeal Young’s ruling. Jenkins’ decision comes less than two weeks before the presidential election. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights a key component of her campaign. Harris has repeatedly pointed out that Donald Trump appointed three supreme court justices who voted to Roe v Wade. The former US president, who took credit for overturning Roe v Wade but recently toned down his language amid backlash, continues to poll far lower with women voters.

"abortion","A Wisconsin state supreme court race will test whether abortion can still tip an election","The United States on Tuesday will face its first major election of the Trump 2.0 era: a race for a single state supreme court seat in Wisconsin that could not only rewrite abortion access in the state, but test whether the issue of abortion rights can still drive voters to the polls. On Tuesday, Wisconsin residents will decide whether to elect liberal Susan Crawford or conservative Brad Schimel, two county judges, to the state supreme court, which is poised to weigh in on two major abortion cases. Abortion rights advocates are trying to use the threat to the procedure to convince people to head to the polls, but, more than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, it is no longer clear whether abortion can tip an election. Democratic candidates talked about outrage over Roe constantly during the 2024 election – and fell short, losing both the White House and the Senate. Ben Wikler, leader of the Democratic party of Wisconsin, remains convinced that the issue can be Democrats’ silver bullet. “Abortion is the single issue that most motivates Democratic voters and persuades independent, moderate voters to cast a ballot for Susan Crawford and against Brad Schimel,” Wikler said. Although the candidates are nominally non-partisan, the Democratic party is backing Crawford, while Donald Trump has endorsed Schimel. If Schimel wins, conservatives will regain control of the state supreme court. “Democrats are fired up and they’re angry,” Wikler continued. “They want a channel to create change at this moment, and they do not want to go back to an abortion ban.” After Roe collapsed in June 2022, abortion providers across Wisconsin stopped offering the procedure out of fear that they could be prosecuted under an 1849 law declaring that “any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of the unborn child” is guilty of a felony. Under the law – which was first enacted only a year after Wisconsin became a state and before women had the right to vote – abortions are only permitted to save a patient’s life. That kind of exception, doctors across the country have said, is so narrow as to be unworkable. Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, filed a lawsuit arguing that the 1849 ban only applies in instances of feticide, or when someone ends a pregnancy against a pregnant person’s will. A court sided with Kaul, suspending the ban, but the state supreme court heard arguments in a case over the ban late last year. A ruling in that case is set to be released before Crawford or Schimel would join the state supreme court bench. However, the court is also expected to hear arguments in a separate case – filed by Planned Parenthood – over whether the Wisconsin constitution protects abortion rights. If it does, the 1849 ban could be struck down completely. Schimel, who personally opposes abortion, has previously called the 1849 ban “valid”. “There is not a constitutional right to abortion in our state constitution,” Schimel said on a campaign stop, according to the New York Times. “That will be a sham if they find that.” Crawford has avoided speaking directly about the 1849 ban. She has, however, released multiple ads slamming Schimel for his stance on abortion. “Brad Schimel wants to make sure women don’t have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. If he wins, that right is gone,” Crawford said in a recent ad. “I trust women to make their own healthcare decisions.” The fall of Roe turbocharged the public’s attention on state supreme court elections, once a relatively sleepy corner of US politics, as abortion rights catapulted to the top of many liberal voters’ priorities. Without a federal guarantee of the right to an abortion, lawsuits over the procedure are increasingly waged in state courts, and state supreme courts often have the final word on whether it remains legal. Spending on such races has skyrocketed. In 2023, when another seat on the Wisconsin state supreme court was up for grabs, campaigns and outside groups spent an eye-popping $51m – at the time, a record amount for a state supreme court election. Tuesday’s election has smashed that record. As of last week, more than $80m had been poured into the race. Elon Musk, the richest person on the planet, and the groups he funds have spent more than $20m in support of Schimel; the billionaire George Soros has given $1m to the Democratic party of Wisconsin, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s just an entirely new world when it comes to judicial elections,” said Douglas Keith, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Judiciary Program, who tracks supreme court races. “These look so much more like a top-tier US Senate race than they do the judicial elections from even just a few years ago.” One anti-abortion political action committee, Women Speak Out Pac, has dropped more than $500,000 into the race, campaign finance records show. The Pac, which is partnered with the powerful anti-abortion organization SBA Pro-Life America, has over the last seven years received more than $20m in funding from the Republican megadonor Dick Uihlein and a Pac he uses to fund his pet causes, which include opposition to abortion, unions and taxes. Parties’ investment in these races has also increased – over the last few weeks, Wikler said, Wisconsin Democrats had reached “hundreds of thousands” of voters, more than doubling their record from 2023. This single race has cost more than all state supreme court races in 2018 – a development that Keith calls “deeply troubling” for democracy. “Voters are not receiving reliable information from all this money. They’re receiving a barrage of ads, many of which are misleading and do nothing to actually inform the electorate,” Keith said. The candidates have debated just once. He added: “It just makes it so hard for the public to view courts as anything different than the other branches, and to have any reason to trust the decisions that come out of the courts.”","2025-03-31T11:00:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/31/wisconsin-abortion-state-supreme-court"
"abortion","JD Vance decried as extremist over attack on UK abortion clinic safe zones","JD Vance has been labelled an “extremist” after he launched a broadside against the UK’s efforts to protect women seeking an abortion. The US vice-president’s criticisms of UK and Scottish policies on safe access zones around abortion clinics – part of a wide-ranging tirade against Europe on Friday – were derided as inaccurate and misogynistic by a number of groups, politicians and governments. Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of Bpas, the UK’s leading provider of abortion services, said safe zones – buffer areas of 150 metres around abortion clinics designed to stop women being harassed with leaflets, shown pictures of foetuses, or having to pass by vigils – were vital to protect women’s access to essential healthcare in an “overwhelmingly pro-choice country”. “Bpas ... will always remain proud to stand against misogynistic and anti-democratic interference with British women’s reproductive rights by foreign extremists, whether they are the vice-president of the US or not,” she said. The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who campaigned for the safe zones which were introduced last year, posted a picture of a scene from the dystopian television series The Handmaid’s Tale alongside with the words: “And so it begins … ” She accused Vance of calling “for the right to harass women having an abortion” because “our bodies are their battleground, our human rights their target”. In Vance’s speech at the Munich security conference, he said the UK had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons … in the crosshairs”, citing the prosecution of Adam Smith-Connor, a physiotherapist and army veteran. Vance said he had been charged with the “heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own”. Smith-Connor, who is receiving legal support from Alliance Defending Freedom International, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group in the US, was convicted of breaching a safe zone in October last year after refusing repeated requests to move away from outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022. A community officer spoke to him for an hour and 40 minutes and asked him to leave, but he refused. Smith-Connor was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay more than £9,000 costs after the case brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council. Vance also claimed the Scottish government had distributed letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. Shortly after his statement, a Scottish government spokesperson said: “The vice-president’s claim is incorrect. Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was.” The Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Act, introduced last year, banned “silent prayer” to prevent mass silent vigils that have been used by large groups of US pro-life protesters such as 40 Days for Life. The law states that the actions are only banned if they are likely to cause alarm or distress to someone accessing abortion services. The Scottish Green MSP Gillian Mackay, who pushed for the introduction of safe zones, said Vance was spreading “shocking and shameless misinformation”. She said: “He is one of the most powerful people in the world but he is peddling total nonsense and dangerous scaremongering.” The managing director for the Abortion Support Network, Camille Kumar, accused him of “dog-whistle messaging” and an attack on “fragile” women’s rights. “It is deeply concerning that within days of pardoning [protesters] in the US for their harassment of women and pregnant people outside abortion clinics, JD Vance is now trying to stir up anti-abortion rhetoric in the UK.” The director of the End Violence, Andrea Simon, said: “Safe access buffer zones were introduced to ensure that women can safely access abortion services without fear of harassment. That is vital, because abortion is a fundamental healthcare right for women in the UK, which must be protected.”","2025-02-15T12:33:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/15/jd-vance-decried-as-extremist-over-attack-on-uk-abortion-clinic-safe-zones"
"abortion","State and federal MPs describe death threats and vile abuse in wake of Joanna Howe’s anti-abortion campaign","State and federal MPs around the country say they and their staff have received death threats from third parties amid controversy generated by the self-described “assertiveness” of the anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe. Howe, an expert in migration law at the University of Adelaide, has campaigned for anti-abortion laws in various state parliaments, and this month organised a rally – attended by the former prime minister Tony Abbott – against NSW reforms to improve access to services. She said on social media people “need to be hysterical” about the bill, which represented what she called “an extreme, radical takeover of our country”. In NSW parliament this week, the state Liberal leader, Mark Speakman, accused Howe of “brazen bullying”. The NSW Greens MP Amanda Cohn, who introduced the bill, told Guardian Australia she had received “threats to my personal safety” from third parties and felt her workplace had become “unsafe” for her staff. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Labor’s Julia Finn accused Howe in NSW parliament last week of using “bizarre and nasty” tactics and “obnoxious, attention-seeking behaviour”. She told parliament Howe had gone into her office and spoken to a heavily pregnant and “vulnerable” electorate officer, and “while she did not say anything unkind”, the interaction was filmed and posted without the staff member’s knowledge or consent. “That is not OK,” Finn said. Howe did not take the post down when asked, Finn said. Howe said in a social media post it was possible the staff member did not know she was being filmed but didn’t know if she (Howe) could be held responsible for that. A federal MP who asked not to be named told Guardian Australia they were targeted online by Howe after expressing their views on abortion. They said they then received abusive messages from anonymous people, including one who said they hoped the MP would suffer and die, and another who said their mother should have “swallowed” so that they were never born. The MP said they were concerned enough about those messages to contact the police. The independent South Australian MLC Tammy Franks, formerly of the Greens, told Guardian Australia her office received threats from third parties after Howe named her as part of the “Baby-Killers Club” for being opposed to what the Greens described as a “forced birth” bill last year. Howe was banned from SA parliament for her behaviour during the vote for that bill. “We got lots of death threats, we got rape threats to the office … that was to the person who answered the phone,” Franks said. Howe has posted multiple videos of herself following MPs and asking them questions about abortion. In one, she follows the South Australian child protection minister, Katrine Hildyard, as she leaves Easter mass and, as Hildyard helps a parishioner into a car, asks her why she wants “babies born dead”. Hildyard was also one of the women Howe branded as part of the “Baby-Killers Club”. Staff in the office of the Queensland Labor leader, Steven Miles, called the police after Howe entered their office last year and the person with her began filming without consent, while she asked a staff member about abortion and refused to leave when asked. Howe posted a video of the police talking to her after the incident. The police said their concern was that she had not left when asked. Howe said she thought it was “problematic in a democracy” that she couldn’t speak to Miles, who was premier at the time, to “hold him to account”, and “insane” that the staff member called the police. No charges were laid. One social media post from Howe about Miles attracted multiple comments from other internet users wishing death on Miles, including saying someone should “terminate his life”, that he should “have a date with a NOOSE” and that he should swing “from the gallows”. The comments remain online. In 2023, the Labor MLC Lorna Harper told the Western Australian parliament Howe had attacked her and her beliefs online and encouraged her followers to “leave offensive messages” on her social media for supporting abortion legislation. Harper said “according to [Howe’s] followers” she was “a baby killer, a murderer, not fit to be in parliament, a radical, highly offensive, gutless, coldblooded and a feminist extremist”. ‘Not your nice, pro-life Christian girl’ Howe has been praised by the Coalition senators Alex Antic and Matt Canavan, the United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet and some state parliament representatives for her advocacy for anti-abortion laws, none of which have passed. Speakman told parliament this week Howe had “threatened to lead a public campaign aimed at encouraging a grassroots opposition to you as Liberal leader” if he supported the NSW bill. “I will not cave to brazen bullying like this nor to the Americanisation of NSW politics,” Speakman said. Howe said in response on social media that politicians used parliamentary privilege to tell “the most brazen lies” while they “work with their comrades in the media in advance” to get coverage. She said MPs weaponised accusations of misinformation and disinformation and likened it to “some kind of Tourette’s” or “verbal diarrhoea”. She said of being called a bully that it was “democracy” and she was just asking questions. “It’s not like I’m going around threatening to beat up their family or I’m finding them in a dark alleyway and I’m … harassing them,” she said. She said pro-life women and church leaders had always sat down with politicians for meetings and “just lost dismally”, playing “Christian voters for fools”. “I’m not your nice pro-life Christian girl,” she said. “I bring a level of activism and assertiveness and it’s clearly effective because it’s rattled you [NSW politicians],” she said. “You’re just going to have to get with the program, because the old sitting down for a meeting and listening to your BS … those days are over. We’re not doing that any more.” Howe also published video of the NSW premier, Chris Minns, criticising her. “He’s just called me a liar and a bully,” she said. “It really just shows how fragile these snowflake politicians are.” Other comments he made were “good” for a potential defamation action, she said. “For Minns to say that, you know, I’m responsible for all this misinformation, whipping up this hysteria – people need to be hysterical about this bill,” she said. “This was an extreme, radical takeover of our country.” Howe targeted the federal Liberal senator Maria Kovacic with a petition for her to be “dumped”, describing her as having an “anti-child, anti-family ideology”. Kovacic told Guardian Australia MPs had a duty to resist attempts to coerce them into silence or submission. Franks said she “can’t believe” the University of Adelaide lets Howe “trade on her association with that institution as a law professor when her lack of respect for … what is reasonable behaviour in the democratic process continues to be flouted”. The university said academics were free to “make lawful public comment on any issue in their personal capacities”, but were expected to comply with the university’s code of conduct. It did not say whether it considered Howe’s actions to be in accordance with the code. Howe did not respond to a request for comment, but posted on X saying she did not need to answer questions and was “busy being a real person with a life”.","2025-05-21T03:35:48Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/21/state-and-federal-mps-describe-death-threats-and-vile-abuse-in-wake-of-joanna-howes-anti-abortion-campaign-ntwnfb"
"abortion","The anti-abortion movement weighs its next move: ‘We haven’t gone away’","Minutes into the National Pro-Life Summit, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, had convinced its more than 1,000 attendees to leap to their feet. She was recording a video, and she had a message she wanted them to send to Donald Trump. “THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT!” the crowd in the ballroom thundered, before bursting into raucous applause – complete with wolf whistles. Every January, anti-abortion activists from across the country gather in Washington for the March for Life, the largest anti-abortion gathering in the US. In recent years, the march has been followed by the National Pro-Life Summit, which seeks to take the raw energy of the march and channel it towards specific organizations and policy aims. The summit, which is organized by the powerful Students for Life of America, held seminars on efforts to halt access to abortion pills, protect campus free speech and defend marriage as the union between one man and one woman. There was a pro-life job fair, where young people could learn about working for the Heritage Foundation – the architects of the famous Project 2025 policy playbook – as well as a huge room where they could pick up T-shirts with slogans such as “DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD”. There was one overarching theme that knit the summit together: thanks to Trump, the anti-abortion movement is on the upswing. “For those of you that were advocating for an America that isn’t weak and pathetic, but instead one that has borders, one that defends the unborn, one that believes in liberty and freedom – it is amazing to see how quick America can get back on pace,” the Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk told the cheering crowd assembled in the ballroom. He continued: “You guys have an amazing ally in the White House in the fight for life. Both President Trump and JD Vance.” In his first few days in office, Trump has already notched a few victories for the anti-abortion movement, as he reinstated the Mexico City policy limiting funding for overseas groups that perform or advocate for abortions, issued an executive order that declared that gender begins “at conception” and pardoned several anti-abortion activists who had been convicted of illegally blocking an abortion clinic. His Department of Justice also promised to significantly curtail prosecutions against people accused of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or Face, which has been used to protect abortion clinics from violence. But he has not implemented more sweeping anti-abortion measures, such as using the 19th-century anti-vice law the Comstock Act to in effect ban abortion nationwide. As thrilled as anti-abortion activists may now be, there’s still work to be done – and a question lingering over the movement: what exactly is their role in his administration? When he ran for president in 2016, Trump was powered by a coalition of anti-abortion activists who agreed to throw their weight behind him if he appointed “pro-life” justices to the US supreme court. He kept that promise and, thanks in large part to his nominees, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. But by 2024, after abortion rights supporters won multiple red-state ballot measures, Trump was a far less reliable ally to the anti-abortion movement. He repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue, prompting criticism from prominent anti-abortion activists, including Hawkins. Trump won the presidential election anyway. Not necessarily because people oppose abortion – several states that Trump won also voted in favor of measures preserving access to the procedure – but because Trump’s popularity may exceed that of the movement that once propelled him to the White House. In an interview, Hawkins rejected the idea that Trump is more popular than the anti-abortion cause. (Fifty-four per cent of Americans identify as “pro-choice”, while 41% say they are “pro-life”, according to recent Gallup polling.) While Trump has objected to signing a national abortion ban, Hawkins wants him to commit to defunding Planned Parenthood. She also hopes that Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has been tapped to head the Department of Health and Human Services, will be open to rolling back the FDA’s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, given Kennedy’s skepticism toward pharmaceutical companies. “I have a whole lot of damn bodies,” Hawkins said. “You can think we’re annoying all you want, but we have a lot of people and we haven’t gone away.” In making a deal with Trump, Hawkins suggested that her group’s strongest asset was their organizing. She pointed to the anti-abortion movement’s recent electoral successes at the state level, such as the defeat of multiple South Carolina Republicans who blocked a total abortion ban. “We’ve been around for 52 years,” Hawkins said. “We’re not novices at this.” Even if Trump isn’t the anti-abortion movement’s most devoted champion, much of the movement appears ready to embrace Trumpism anyway. Some of the biggest speakers at the summit – such as Kirk, the former housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson and Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany – are less known for their involvement in the anti-abortion movement than for their proximity to Maga. Several attenders donned Maga hats; one couple wore a pair in his-and-hers blue and pink. Tributes to Trump and Vance regularly punctuated speakers’ talks. “I have never in my life seen a more important message – not just for the March for Life but for the future of our movement – than the one that Vice-President JD Vance gave,” the Heritage Foundation president, Kevin Roberts, told the summit attendees. “In particular, the vice-president put his finger on something that is necessary – just definitionally – for the survival of the American republic: we need more babies!” The crowd burst into applause. “Woo!” someone cheered. • This article was amended on 27 January 2025 to correct an editing error omitting the number of Students for Life of America attenders at the National Pro-Life Summit.","2025-01-26T14:30:32Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/26/us-anti-abortion-movement-trump"
"abortion","Trump and Vance back anti-abortion activists in March for Life speeches","In addresses to the March for Life, the nation’s largest anti-abortion rally, Donald Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, both indicated on Friday that the US justice department would no longer prosecute anti-abortion activists. “No longer will our government throw pro-life protesters and activists – elderly, grandparents, or anybody else – in prison,” Vance told the thousands-strong crowd that gathered on the National Mall, in the shadow of the Washington Monument. “It stopped on Monday, and we’re not gonna let it come back to this country.” Vance trumpeted the president’s decision to, on Thursday, pardon several anti-abortion activists who had been convicted of violating the federal Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or the Face Act, by blockading an abortion clinic. That law penalizes people who threaten, obstruct or injure someone who is trying to access a reproductive health clinic – or who vandalize a clinic. Anti-abortion activists have, for years, attempted to strike it down or convince the federal government to stop enforcing it. “I’m releasing the Christians and pro-life activists who were persecuted by the Biden regime for praying and living out their faith,” Trump said in his own address, which the president pre-recorded and broadcast to the crowd on two giant screens. He added: “Never again will religious persecution be allowed to happen in America.” However, neither Trump nor Vance talked about any of the sweeping policies that abortion rights activists are now bracing for, such as the enforcement of a 19th-century anti-vice law that could effectively ban abortion nationwide. They did not even mention the Mexico City policy, which is also known as the “global gag rule” and which blocks foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from receiving assistance if they refer people for abortions, counsel them on the procedure or advocate for its access. Every Republican president since Ronald Reagan has enforced this rule. And every Democratic one has rescinded it, although Trump – during his first presidency – dramatically expanded the rule’s scope so that it affected some $6bn in aid. The lack of immediate action from the new Trump administration on the policy has puzzled abortion rights supporters. In recent years, the March for Life has at times doubled as a Trump rally. This year’s iteration was no different. Vendors sold marchers red hats with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) slogan and T-shirts bearing the words “FIGHT … FIGHT … FIGHT!” above an image of Trump holding his fist in the air (which was taken shortly after his attempted assassination in July). Trump and Vance’s appearances also seemingly garnered the biggest roars from the crowd – far more than any anti-abortion talking point or the appearances of the US Senate majority leader, John Thune, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, or Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis. Johnson did win big cheers from the marchers, though, when he mentioned a recent executive order that declared that people are divided into male and female “at conception”. That language evokes the doctrine of fetal personhood, which holds that embryos and fetuses should be granted full legal rights and protections – and which, if fully enacted, would totally outlaw abortion as well as potentially criminalize abortion patients. “Our country has got to get back to God,” said Marie Summergren, 64, of Pennsylvania. “Neither one – our president or our vice-president – has any problem saying that.” She added: “It feels as though the tide is turning. It’s OK to talk about God again.” (Joe Biden, the previous president, was a devout Catholic.) The marchers struck an ebullient tone, convinced that Trump’s return to the White House signaled their own return to power after a series of electoral defeats. After Vance spoke, the crowd chanted: “JD! JD! JD!” Then, as they marched towards the National Mall and the US Capitol building, cheers like “We love babies! Yes we do!” and “Your mom! Chose life!” sprang up. They also carried signs that declared “Life Wins,” “Defund Planned Parenthood” and “Make More Babies.” Many did not seem convinced that abortion bans should contain any exceptions. “Human life starts at conception,” said Henry Cooper, an 18-year-old march attender from California. “An abortion is never medically necessary. Ectopic pregnancy is something else. That’s not considered an abortion. There’s always something you can do.” “Besides ectopic pregnancies, there are no cases where abortion improves the likelihood of the mother surviving other than a non-abortion way would,” agreed Luc Lessard, 18, of Colorado. “There’s no real cause for it.” (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the pre-eminent membership organization for US ob-gyns, has repeatedly emphasized the medical need for abortion access. At least five women have reportedly died after abortion bans affected their medical care.) Both Cooper and Lessard voted for Trump. The duo bought a pair of red Maga hats for $30 at the march. “I’m excited for the next four years,” Cooper said.","2025-01-24T22:39:16Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/trump-vance-march-for-life"

The incident is the second involving a major airline in the US since Friday, when a Southwest flight took a sudden nosedive to avoid a midair collision shortly after takeoff in Burbank, California.","2025-07-27T12:43:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/27/american-airlines-aborts-takeoff-denver"
"abortion","Abortion remains a criminal offence in the UK because of the left’s timidity. We must learn from that – and fast","Around the world, the antis are joining forces. Whether anti-abortion, anti-transgender, anti-immigrant, anti-human rights or just anti anyone who doesn’t look like them, they are collaborating; amplifying one another and sharing their political and cultural successes. Their rhetoric now dominates our discussions, and increasingly our ballot boxes. In response, some argue caution or even capitulation – as if we can stop the public being dragged to the extremes if we speak in hushed tones or water down our ambitions for social justice. As we witness the consequences of this, it is time to speak up for those values that drive us to show that another future is possible. On Tuesday, parliament had the opportunity to set abortion in England and Wales on the same modern, regulated footing as it is in Northern Ireland: as a human right. Instead, a vote on this was explicitly blocked by the providers of this service and their supporters, telling MPs to back another amendment, to get a single exemption from prosecution for women “over the line” instead. That is what happened. In contrast, my proposed amendment would have gone further, offering “protection to all those involved in ensuring that women can access safe and legal abortions”. In the current parliament, any pro-choice amendment would have passed. A critical opportunity not just to stop the destructive prosecutions and investigations under outdated laws of everyone, including medics, but to also protect access for the 250,000 who have an abortion every year, has been missed. As a result, the laws that make abortion a criminal act remain, ready to be exploited by those who wish to attack access should they come to power. With the Donald Trump playbook increasingly dominating our politics, such judgments about what to fight for and when will become even harder – and even more important – in the coming months and years. Even when presented with evidence of the risks to women’s rights, progressives in the UK retain a confidence that isn’t merited. US colleagues warn of the compromises made in the Barack Obama and Joe Biden years on securing abortion rights that left them so exposed. Although Trump pledged not to get involved in abortion as an issue, within his first week back in office he signed directives to attack access as well as pardon those who harassed clinicians. Many in the UK may have been shocked by the overturning of Roe v Wade, but to those working on abortion access, it was entirely predictable. Pleas to get ahead of these forces fell on closed ears there and have now done the same here. Now, US medics fight extradition charges for providing abortion care to those who have crossed state lines to access one. Legislators reclassified abortion medication as a dangerous substance to reduce access. Funding for family planning clinics is being cut off as well as international programmes that support women’s healthcare – all in the name of promoting family values. Networks using women’s bodies as the battlefield for the culture wars are not just in the US. Across Europe, restrictions on access and bans are being put forward and won by far-right political groups once in office. In Poland, abortion has been effectively banned since 2020. In Italy, under Giorgia Meloni, anti-abortion activists are now being encouraged into abortion clinics. Under Viktor Orbán, women in Hungary seeking an abortion are now required to listen to the foetal heartbeat repeatedly before treatment. The cross-pollination of hatred across issues such as immigration, gender and ethnicity exists on this topic, too. Across the world, these forces whip up allegations of “abortion at birth” or “sex selection”. Our mainstream newspapers repeat these claims, claims that have no foundation in the medical evidence, but deter those with the power to protect women’s rights from acting for fear of appearing to endorse such acts. Events of this week reflect how these ideologies and those who follow them are already defining what those on the left consider possible in office. But those on the right will not stop their attacks because we pull our punches – indeed, they will become increasingly emboldened, believing that they have us on the back foot. As the culture wars intensify, the left needs to set out not its blue roots, but its true roots, showing how, at its best, it delivers emancipation. That means telling a story that recognises how poverty, inequality and injustice take many individual forms but are collectively devastating. Each holds back people in every community from realising their potential, to the detriment of all of us who will not benefit from what their talents can achieve. Rights – whether human, reproductive or economic – act as a launchpad for such freedom. Ours vision for the future is one in which equality liberates the ability to succeed – whatever race, sex, religion or age you are, or what political view you hold. In the coming months and years, attacks on progressive values will intensify. As we face them, let this missed opportunity to reform our abortion legislation so that it is fit for the 21st century, remind us all that half measures are not what we are in politics to take. In politics, as in life, fortune favours the brave, and the alternative possible future that these forces wish to snatch from our children compels us to fight for it – not least because we know those opposed to it will never be satisfied. As we face what comes next, regret has no place in our toolbox for securing progressive outcomes. But remembering this moment and learning from it is vital.

"abortion","Kentucky woman seeking abortion files lawsuit challenging state’s bans","A pregnant woman in Kentucky seeking an abortion filed a lawsuit on Tuesday asking a court to strike down the state’s abortion bans. The woman, who is known in court records as Mary Poe and is about seven or eight weeks pregnant, is challenging Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban and the six-week ban simultaneously in effect. These bans, Poe argues, violate the Kentucky constitution’s rights to privacy and self-determination and should not be enforced. “For many individuals, the bans altogether foreclose the ability to access abortion, thus forcing them to carry their pregnancies to term and give birth, which carries a risk of death up to 14 times higher than that associated with abortion,” the lawsuit alleges. “Others, pushed by the bans to travel out of state for legal care, bear the burdens both of increased health risks from being pushed later into pregnancy and of the cost and logistical difficulties of long-distance travel.” The lawsuit also requests class-action status for all people who may be pregnant or can become so but are unable to get a abortion in Kentucky. “I feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it’s legal,” Poe said in a statement. “This involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me. This is my personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not one made by anyone else.” The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, and the law firm Kaplan, Johnson, Abate &amp; Bird are representing Poe. Kentucky is one of more than a dozen states that have banned almost all abortions in the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. It is also one of several states that have overlapping abortion bans on the books – a result of Roe-era efforts by state legislators to pile up abortion restrictions to both score political points with the anti-abortion movement and generate opportunities for the supreme court to take up a challenge to Roe. Last year, another pregnant Kentucky woman also sued the state over its anti-abortion laws, but she later learned that her embryo was no longer viable. That case was ultimately dismissed.","2024-11-12T21:19:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/kentucky-abortion-ban-lawsuit"
"abortion","Abortion pills to be easier to access after Greens bill passes in NSW despite opposition from Tony Abbott","New South Wales women will have easier access to abortion pills after the state passed a bill allowing nurse practitioners and registered midwives to prescribe the medication. The bill – which aims to improve access to healthcare for women in rural and regional areas – passed the lower house on Wednesday, despite vocal opposition including by former prime minister Tony Abbott. Greens health spokesperson and member of the upper house Dr Amanda Cohn’s bill on medical abortions brings NSW in line with all other states and territories except Tasmania. A medical abortion involves taking prescribed abortion pills up to nine weeks into gestation, while a surgical abortion is a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, told the lower house on Tuesday night he supported the bill and refused to “cave to brazen bullying [or] to the Americanisation of New South Wales politics” after he claimed in parliament that prominent anti-abortion campaigner Joanna Howe threatened to lead a grassroots campaign against his leadership if he supported the change. Speakman said the bill would not interfere with freedom of conscience of nurses and midwives, and “will probably lead to better, not worse, health outcomes for many pregnant women seeking abortions”. Independent Alex Greenwich, who moved the 2019 bill decriminalising abortion, supported the new changes and highlighted how many women in rural, regional and remote areas missed out on medical terminations because of delays to accessing care. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Some communities do not have GPs, and even in communities where there are GPs, getting a timely appointment can be difficult, and the only GP in the town might have a conscientious objection, Greenwich said. “Medical abortions provide the least invasive and lowest risk termination option [… but] they can only be performed up until nine weeks gestation, which means there is a small window of opportunity that could easily be closed by delays,” Greenwich said. “After that, the only option is a surgical abortion,” he said. Greens lower house MP Jenny Leong, who introduced the bill in the lower house, highlighted Guardian Australia’s reporting in December which revealed that only three of the 220 public hospitals in NSW consistently and openly provide surgical abortions. “When reporting from the ABC and the Guardian revealed the scale and prevalence of barriers to abortion access in New South Wales, there was widespread outrage and concern in this place and beyond,” Leong said. “The Greens knew, then, as we know now, that outrage alone without action was not going to be enough, and that is why today, I am so pleased to be able to bring this bill to this chamber.” All members except the Greens were allowed a conscience vote. The minister for health, Ryan Park, and shadow minister for health, Kellie Sloane, supported the bill. Park noted the 2024 statutory review of the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 conducted by NSW Health, which recommended allowing highly qualified nurse practitioners and midwives to prescribe abortion medication in the case of pregnancies of up to nine weeks. The review noted that while the 2019 legislation decriminalising abortion had resulted in a more supportive environment for women to access abortion care, “it has not always led to improvements in real and equitable access, particularly for women living in regional, rural or remote parts of NSW, Aboriginal women, culturally and linguistically diverse women and women who are socially and/or financially disadvantaged”. The Liberal MP Anthony Roberts said he would not support “legislation that increases the number of people who can administer a procedure that takes a life”. Roberts, as well as Liberal MPs Monica Tudehope and Ray Williams, were concerned about how the change would affect the healthcare of women and cited a study of medical abortions from the US-based thinktank and advocacy group the Ethics and Public Policy Center, published in April, which found an adverse event rate of over 10%, including sepsis, infection or haemorrhaging. In her closing remarks, Leong raised concerns with the reference to that paper, which she said the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists had described as a flawed report based on a faulty methodology. Labor MP Julia Finn criticised campaign tactics from those opposed to the bill, telling the lower house “some of the campaign tactics engaged have amounted to bullying and spreading misinformation and disinformation – not lobbying.” She pointed in particular to the behaviour of Howe, who she said put pressure on members of parliament to vote against the bill and organised a rally outside NSW parliament, saying her behaviour had been “dreadful”. Speakman told parliament that Howe had emailed him, telling him that if the premier, Chris Minns, voted for the bill and allowed its passage, she would lead a campaign across five marginal seats that are Labor-held. “She then threatened: ‘However, if you choose to vote for the bill, I will be left with no other choice but to suspend my planned campaign against Labor in order to lead a public campaign aimed at encouraging a grassroots opposition to you as Liberal leader’,” Speakman said. The bill had already passed the upper house on Thursday last week. However, it will have to return to the upper house in a few weeks’ time to be officially passed into law due to a typographical error in the bill from the upper house. Howe has been approached for comment.","2025-05-14T06:30:58Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/nsw-medical-abortion-access-bill-passes-both-houses-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Volunteers rush to send abortion pills to US women in need as ‘war between the states’ looms","Seated around a circular table in a nondescript office building just outside Boston, the volunteers pack the abortion pills into envelopes with practiced efficiency. Each of the volunteers – five women and one man – have a unique role in the assembly line. One volunteer drops slim, orange boxes of mifepristone, the first drug typically used in a medication abortion, into the envelopes, while another volunteer adds green-capped bottles of the second drug, misoprostol. A few volunteers add brochures on topics such as how to use abortion pills or what to do if a woman suspects she has an ectopic pregnancy. Finally, one volunteer drops small purple cards into each envelope. They all bear the same handwritten message: “We wish you the best.” The cards are signed with a swooping heart and a nondescript name: “the Map”, or the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project. By the end of the day, dozens of these envelopes will have been dropped off at a US Postal Service office – many on their way to people who live in states that have banned abortion. The Map is one of a handful of organizations operating under a controversial legal innovation known as a “shield law”. Enacted by eight states in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, shield laws are designed to protect abortion providers from red-state prosecutions and legal actions, even if the providers’ patients are located in states that ban abortion. Providers in shield law states routinely ship abortion pills across state lines: in spring 2024, they facilitated more than 7,700 monthly abortions in states with total or six-week abortion bans, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. But shield laws are now being put to the test. In December, Texas sued Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York doctor, over allegations that she violated Texas’s abortion bans by mailing abortion pills to a Texas woman. Then, in January, a Louisiana grand jury criminally indicted Carpenter. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, has refused to sign an extradition order for Carpenter. Citing the state’s shield law, a New York county clerk has also refused to enforce a $113,000 fine, levied by a Texas court, against her. Now, Texas is expected to sue New York over the shield law – a move that could ultimately land the case in front of the supreme court, dominated 6-3 by conservatives, and tip the balance of power between states that protect abortion rights and those that do not. “No one wanted this, but it’s not unexpected,” said Dr Angel Foster, the Map’s co-founder, of the state-on-state fight. “I think we were prepared for this to happen, and we’re waiting for the next shoe to drop.” The legal battle has not slowed down demand at the Map. Before dropping their prices last year, the Map was mailing pills to about 500 patients a month. Now, it provides pills to roughly 2,500 per month. “Since the election, it’s felt even more urgent to have a tangible and literally hands-on impact. A package is going to somebody who needs it, in a place where they are being denied their rights,” one Map volunteer said as she sealed envelopes. She spread her palm out on a package as if she were placing a hand on a Bible. “It’s going to a real person.” ‘War between the states’ To order pills from the Map, a patient must be within their first trimester of pregnancy and at least 16, the age of consent for an abortion under Massachusetts law. After they fill out an online intake form, a licensed clinician reviews their chart; if a patient has questions, someone from Map will take their call. Because the organization operates on a sliding scale, patients can receive pills for as little as $5. On one recent Tuesday morning, Cheryl, a retired OB-GYN, sat in the Map’s tiny, dimly lit office and quietly clicked through patients’ charts, evaluating the answers to questions about the date of their last period and their past pregnancies. Patients shared why they wanted abortions, but Cheryl rarely lingered over their answers. One, however, struck her: a 25-year-old single mom who felt like another pregnancy would endanger her ability to take care of her child. It reminded Cheryl of the five years she spent providing abortions at Mississippi’s last abortion clinic, which shuttered shortly after the supreme court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization paved the way for state abortion bans to unfurl across the US. “That was a really common refrain: ‘I just want to do right by the kids I have,’” Cheryl recalled. About half of the Map’s patients, she said, already have children. They are also predominantly under 35 and people of color – similar to abortion patients writ large, at least before Roe fell. After Roe’s collapse forced the Mississippi clinic to close, Cheryl started providing abortions in North Carolina – until that state banned the procedure after 12 weeks and the clinic where she worked no longer needed her services. “I was sitting at home, being sad and useless and doing local advocacy stuff,” Cheryl said. She also grew increasingly angry and frustrated with what she saw as mass complacency with the post-Roe reality. That’s when someone told her: “I have just the group for you.” Working with the Map means assuming a certain level of risk. There is no way to guarantee that a staffer or volunteer won’t get drawn into a lawsuit – or worse. To diffuse risk, the Map never mails anything that includes clinicians’ names. Foster no longer travels to or through states with abortion bans, and does not drive outside of Massachusetts; she doesn’t want to run the risk of getting pulled over for speeding and learning that another state has put out a warrant out for her arrest. This is also, in part, why the Map relies on an assembly line to put its packages together: there is no single person to point a finger at. “I’m feeling like the people that have the power to protect us really aren’t, so we just have to keep moving along and doing what we think is right,” Cheryl said. “It’s terrifying, but the whole world is terrifying. I feel like just walking down the street these days is terrifying. Someone’s going to whisk you off and accuse you of writing an op-ed or something.” She asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her ability to travel in the US, although Cheryl has no plans to enter a state with an abortion ban. As Cheryl worked, a US map dotted with silver stars glimmered on the wall above her head. Each star represented the location of a patient served in October 2023, the Map’s first month of operation. Although sky-blue areas like the coast of Oregon glinted with stars, most were clustered in the south-eastern US, which is now blanketed in abortion bans. Today, a third of the Map’s patients come from Texas, which outlaws virtually all abortions, while another third hail from Florida and Georgia, which both prohibit abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. The map’s constellations illuminate a paradox of the post-Roe US: even though 26 million women of reproductive age live under a total or six-week abortion ban, many are still receiving abortion pills in the mail or crossing state lines to visit a brick-and-mortar clinic. In 2023 and 2024, the US saw more than 1m abortions – some of the highest numbers in a decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The question is whether this paradox is sustainable. Anti-abortion activists consider this kind of interstate networking an existential threat. While Texas and Louisiana have gone after Carpenter, a number of states have attempted to criminalize people who help others cross state lines for abortions. Courts have frozen many of those efforts, but these legal battles are far from over. With different US states now home to fundamentally contradictory reproductive regimes, both sides – whether they seek to punish out-of-state travel or offer banned healthcare – are scrambling traditional codes of conduct between states, creating new questions about what the constitution allows. These questions are sure to end up before the supreme court. “There isn’t really much of a precedent for anything like shield laws, and the courts are very conservative,” warned Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis School of Law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. The US constitution protects people’s right to travel, but also mandates that states honor court rulings from other states – such as the fine that Texas won against Carpenter (because she and her lawyer did not show up to a court date in the state). In addition, the constitution specifies that, if an individual commits a crime in one state and “shall flee from justice” to another state, that individual must be “delivered up” – or extradited – back to the scene of the crime. Yet there’s no evidence that Carpenter and other shield law providers did “flee from justice”; rather, they’re practicing within and obeying the law of their own home states. “New York is going to say: ‘She’s not a fugitive. This is not the kind of scenario where a court should get involved,’” Ziegler said. “Precedent would say they don’t have to extradite her, and the question would become whether Louisiana can find a way around that.” Ziegler also questioned whether Texas could convince a court to force New York to collect its $113,00 fine. The constitution, she said, forces states to recognize fines levied in lawsuits between individuals – not necessarily fines that result from a lawsuit by a state against an individual. But Steven Aden, the chief legal officer and general counsel at the powerful anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, is bullish about Texas’s chances. “You can’t go to Reno and incur a gambling debt in a casino and then go back home and raise a defense in court, when the casino comes after you for that gambling debt, by saying: ‘We don’t have gambling in our state,’” Aden said. Ziegler and Aden did agree on one thing, though: not only is the supreme court all but certain to take up Carpenter’s case in one form or another, but the high court will likely see a deluge of similar cases over the next several years. “These are the first shots fired in what we like to call – what we reluctantly, I guess, call – a coming war between the states,” Aden said. Experts have noted that the closest parallels are the pre-civil war battles over how to treat enslaved people who had escaped southern states (which permitted slavery) and fled to northern states (which did not). When these disputes reached the US supreme court, as in the case of Dred Scott v Sandford, the court repeatedly sided with enslavers and lent power to the federal government to enforce pro-slavery laws. The modern-day dispute between states over abortion is dramatically different from the 19th-century interstate battle over slavery – but Abraham Lincoln’s famous warning still seems to resonate: “A house divided cannot stand.” ‘Can I volunteer?’ Other threats to abortion pills could soon imperil shield-law providers, too. The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are now pursuing a lawsuit that could roll back providers’ ability to prescribe the pills through the mail. Anti-abortion activists are also trying to cajole the Trump administration to enforce the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that bans the mailing of abortion-related materials but went dormant under Roe. The Map would close if the law no longer protected its work, Foster said. But that doesn’t necessarily mean she would give up. “We might, as a group of people, decide to pivot and do something that’s around civil disobedience, and create a different kind of entity doing different work,” she said. Even if anti-abortion forces prevail in court, there is likely no way to keep abortion pills out of US hands. The US Postal Service already fails, frequently, to detect the illicit drugs that swim through it. In addition to shield law abortion providers, there is a thriving online market for abortion pills that are sent straight from overseas pharmacies, allowing women to end their pregnancies without involving the formal US healthcare system. (Medical experts widely agree that it is safe to end your own pregnancy using pills in the first trimester of pregnancy.) For now, the Map has no shortage of volunteers. As the volunteers stuffed abortion pills into envelopes, a woman working in another part of the office building, who had no connection to the group, walked by the conference room and asked Foster: “Can I volunteer?” Another bystander told them: “Thank you guys for what you’re doing.” It took less than two hours for the volunteers to package some 200 envelopes. Soon after they departed, another pair of volunteers arrived to add shipping labels and drop off the packages, discretely packed into a bin, at a nearby post office. In January, the Map was mailing roughly 150 packages a day – in part, Map project manager Andrea suspects, due to fears surrounding Donald Trump’s inauguration – but that volume has slowed, to about 65 to 85 packages a day. (Andrea asked to be identified by her first name only.) A woman working at the post office once asked Andrea if she was running a jewelry business, given the number of shipments and the rattling sounds each package made. She had mistaken the pills for beads. Andrea smiled. She did not confirm or deny.","2025-04-26T14:00:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/abortion-clinic-pills-shield-laws"
"abortion","‘We are failing’: doctors and students in the US look to Mexico for basic abortion training","On paper, it should not be difficult for Dr Ramos to learn to perform abortions. As a family medicine doctor, Ramos works in a specialty that frequently provides the procedure. He lives in a deep-blue state where it is still allowed. And the administrators running Ramos’s residency program – a kind of apprenticeship that US doctors must undergo to become full-fledged physicians – support Ramos’s desire to learn how to do it. But over the course of his three-year-long residency, Ramos is guaranteed just three days’ worth of training at Planned Parenthood. Residents get to participate in only a handful of abortions. “That’s just not enough if you want to practice abortion care,” said Ramos, who asked to be identified only by his last name to protect his privacy. “I knew that if I wanted to do this, I needed more experience.” That’s why, earlier this month, Ramos traveled to a clinic in Mexico City for two weeks’ worth of training in abortion provision. During his first week at the clinic, which is run by the global organization MSI Reproductive Choices and its Mexican arm Fundación MSI, Ramos performed roughly 60 abortions. In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, paving the way for more than a dozen states to ban virtually all abortions, a small but growing number of would-be abortion providers have begun to leave the country in search of an education. In 2023, MSI trained nine American doctors to perform abortions at clinics in Mexico. In 2024, it trained 27. So far this year, it is on track to double that number. “On one hand, it’s a tremendous relief to know that medical students and residents aren’t going to have to forego this very important part of their training in their education,” said Pamela Merritt, executive director of Medical Students for Choice. Last year, Merritt’s organization helped eight medical students and residents receive abortion training in Mexico and the UK. Merritt continued: “It’s also incredibly sad that in the United States, we are failing to train people even to the standard of care indicated by abortion bans.” Every abortion ban in the US permits abortions to save a patient’s life. But without adequate training, doctors may not be skilled enough to perform abortions even in those dire circumstances. ‘It’s a shame’ Medical schools and residency programs are run by massive hospitals that are heavily dependent on public funding; such institutions tend to be, by nature, leery of anything as controversial as abortion. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has required OB-GYN residencies to teach doctors how to perform abortions since the 1990s, but rather than offer training in-house, hospitals have often farmed their residents out to freestanding abortion clinics for training. Even before Roe fell, this system was faulty: a 2019 study found that, despite the ACGME requirement, just 64% of OB-GYN residency programs offered “routine training with dedicated time” for abortions. Family medicine residents who want to learn to perform abortions face a greater disadvantage, since the ACGME does not require their residency programs to offer any kind of abortion training. Even most OB-GYN residents, program directors reported in the 2019 study, did not achieve what doctors call “competency” when it came to abortion. Without competency – a qualification that’s measured through a melange of doctors’ knowledge, skills and attitudes – doctors may not be able to safely perform abortions on their own. Abortion training and competency is now even harder to come by. Since Roe’s collapse, more than 100 abortion clinics have closed. Those that are left are often besieged by patients fleeing abortion bans, leaving them without the time and space to teach everybody who wants to learn. If an OB-GYN residency program is located in a state that bans abortion, ACGME rules currently dictate that the residency “must provide access to this clinical experience in a different jurisdiction where it is lawful”. The ACGME declined to respond to a request for information about how many residency programs are currently compliant with its abortion-training requirement, although records show that no OB-GYN programs have lost their accreditation status in the last year. Patricia Lohr serves as the director of research and innovation for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas), a UK non-profit that provides abortions up until about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Lohr trained to become an OB-GYN in the US. “Having been a resident and a medical student in the United States, I could really see the importance of having access to abortion education that wasn’t entirely reliant on what was being delivered within academic training programs,” Lohr said. “Because often, abortions weren’t being provided in those academic hospitals.” When Lohr moved to the UK, she quickly moved to create a two-week training program at Bpas where medical students could learn about abortions and observe – but not perform – the procedure. In the years since Roe fell, that training program has received a surge of applications from American medical students and residents. “It’s a shame that people would have to travel to learn a basic part of women’s health care,” Lohr said. “There are many trainees out there at the moment who would like to obtain abortion skills, but cannot get it locally, and so they get diverted into doing something else.” Lauren Wiener, a New Jersey medical student, had originally planned to travel to Arizona in summer 2022 to learn how to provide abortions. But when Roe’s fall led Arizona abortion providers to temporarily stop working, Wiener had to cancel her trip. Instead, she ended up undergoing a week-long training at Bpas last fall. “It is something that you need to know how to do, because there are emergency situations,” Wiener said of abortions. “You might not want to electively perform an abortion at 24 weeks, but if someone comes in and they’re miscarrying, you need to know how to evacuate that uterus. It’s a skill you need to have to save a life.” ‘We will be there’ While training in the US dwindles, the country’s increasingly conservative approach to abortion has also put it at odds with much of the rest of the world. Only four countries – including the US – have tightened their abortion laws over the last 30 years, while more than 60 countries and territories have loosened theirs, according to a tally by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Mexico is one of them. In 2023, its supreme court decriminalized abortion nationwide; the procedure is now available in about half of all Mexican states. And providers aren’t the only people taking advantage of Mexico’s liberalized abortion laws: last year, Fundación MSI provided first-trimester abortions to 62 women from the United States. “Training, training, training – it is key, to have less danger for actual patients,” said Araceli López-Nava, managing director of MSI Latin America. “We understand how difficult the situation is becoming in the US, so we’re happy to help.” The organization has the capacity to train up to 300 doctors a year to perform abortions, López-Nava estimated. MSI is not, however, a solution for everybody. Would-be trainees need to speak Spanish. And although the organization has in past years trained medical students, MSI’s Mexico clinics have started focusing on teaching residents who have already performed 20 abortions. Because residents have already chosen their specialties and secured berths in residency programs – which can be highly competitive – they are more likely to become abortion providers. Training in Mexico can also be pricey, especially since the program does not pay for travel and lodging. Ramos’s entire trip cost about $5,000, although a scholarship helped him cover most of the costs. “It’s a way, at least for me, to be exposed to a different medical system, learn from different providers from a different country, exchange knowledge,” Ramos said. “I feel like I’m being adequately prepared to meet the needs of my patients in the US.” • This article was amended on 10 April 2025 to remove some personal details.","2025-04-09T17:41:31Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/doctors-mexico-abortion-training"
"abortion","Judge allows lawsuit aiming to restrict abortion pills across US to proceed","A lawsuit that aims to restrict nationwide access to abortion pills can proceed, a federal judge in Texas ruled on Thursday, months after the US supreme court rebuked an earlier version of the lawsuit over a legal technicality. The US judge Matthew Kacsmaryk is allowing the attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to continue a case that takes aim at the FDA’s regulation of mifepristone, a drug typically used in medication abortions. Joe Biden’s Department of Justice had asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that the attorneys general had no real link to Kacsmaryk’s court in the northern district of Texas. Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump appointee, said in his ruling that it was too early in litigation to make that call. “Venue remains disputed here,” he wrote, “and should be properly dealt with at a phase where each party may fully argue the issue”. The case could have sweeping implications for the availability of abortion across the country, as medication abortions account for more than two-thirds of all US abortions. The original version of the case, which was brought by a group of anti-abortion activists, sought to roll back the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone – a request Kacsmaryk granted but was later paused by an appeals court. In later litigation, the activists asked courts to reverse more recent FDA rule-making around mifepristone, such as a policy that permits providers to dispense the drug through telehealth. Last year, the US supreme court ruled that the anti-abortion activists behind the case lacked the necessary standing to sue. Although the activists dismissed their case, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri attorneys general filed a 199-page complaint arguing for their right to take up the case in the activists’ stead. “This outrageous case should have been put to bed,” Julia Kaye, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. “Instead, the same Texas judge who already tried to take mifepristone off the market nationwide has left the door open for extremist politicians to continue attacking medication abortion in his courtroom.” It is not yet clear whether Trump’s Department of Justice will continue to defend the FDA’s current regulation of mifepristone. Project 2025, the famous conservative playbook, urged the FDA to roll back its approval of mifepristone on its own.","2025-01-17T13:51:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/17/abortion-pill-mifepristone-lawsuit-texas"
"abortion","Idaho’s ‘abortion trafficking’ law partly revived by US appeals court","Idaho can enforce a first-of-its-kind “abortion trafficking” law against those who harbor or transport a minor to get an abortion out of state without parental consent, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday. But the San Francisco-based 9th US circuit court of appeals in its ruling blocked a part of the law that prohibits “recruiting” a minor to get an abortion. Idaho, which bans abortion in nearly all cases, passed the abortion trafficking law in 2023. It made “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a minor with the intention of helping her get an abortion and conceal it from her parents or guardians a crime punishable by two to five years in prison – even if the abortion took place in a state where abortion is legal. Lourdes Matsumoto, a lawyer and advocate who works with victims of sexual violence, and two groups that support abortion rights sued the state to challenge the law soon after it was passed. They argued that the law violated their right to free speech under the first amendment of the US constitution and that the threat of prosecution prevented them from counseling minors seeking abortions. The circuit judge M Margaret McKeown wrote for the majority that harboring and transporting were not speech, partly reversing a lower court order that had blocked the entire law. However, she wrote that recruiting could include “a large swath” of speech protected by the first amendment, “from encouragement, counseling and emotional support; to education about available medical services and reproductive healthcare; to public advocacy promoting abortion care and abortion access”. “Encouragement, counseling and emotional support are plainly protected speech under supreme court precedent,” McKeown wrote, “including when offered in the difficult context of deciding whether to have an abortion.” McKeown said that while speech can be restricted if it is part of a crime, it is not a crime for a resident of Idaho to get an abortion in a state where it is legal. “Idaho’s asserted police powers do not properly extend to abortions legally performed outside of Idaho,” she wrote. Both sides claimed victory in the ruling. The Idaho attorney general, Raúl Labrador, in a statement called the ruling “a tremendous victory”, adding: “We will not stop protecting life in Idaho.” Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement that the ruling was “a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion healthcare”. McKeown was joined by the circuit judge John Owens. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents. The circuit judge Carlos Bea, an appointee of Republican former president George W Bush, dissented, saying that the entire challenge to the law should be dismissed because the plaintiffs sued Labrador rather than the local prosecutors tasked with enforcing the law. Idaho’s abortion ban provides only permits the procedure in medical emergencies and in cases of rape or incest that are reported to police. It is one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. Idaho borders Washington, Oregon and Montana, which have much more permissive abortion laws. More than 20 Republican-led states have banned or restricted abortion since the US supreme court in 2022 reversed Roe v Wade, the court’s 1973 precedent that had established a right to abortion nationwide. In the years since, Idaho has become a frontline in the US abortion wars. The supreme court recently heard arguments in a case involving the state’s abortion ban, while a handful of women have filed a lawsuit in state court to broaden the exceptions outlined in the ban. Legislators in at least four other states have also introduced bills to ban “abortion trafficking”. One state, Tennessee, has passed it, although a court later blocked that law from taking effect.","2024-12-03T15:32:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/02/idaho-abortion-trafficking-law"
"abortion","Abortions in the US are on the rise three years after Roe v Wade was overturned","Three years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, erasing the national right to abortion and paving the way for more than a dozen states to ban the procedure, the number of abortions performed in the US is still on the rise – including in some states that ban the procedure. US abortion providers performed 1.14m abortions in 2024, according to new data released on Monday by #WeCount, a Society of Family Planning project that has tracked abortion provision since 2022. That’s the highest number on record in recent years. “We were really surprised to see the numbers go up over time,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco professor who serves as co-chair of the #WeCount steering committee. “Abortion bans haven’t really stopped people from needing abortion care. It’s just made it harder for them to be able to get it.” Although most of the abortions documented in #WeCount’s report took place in person, a growing number of abortions are occurring through telehealth, including among patients living in one of the dozen-plus states that ban virtually all abortions. In a telehealth abortion, patients generally meet virtually with a provider before receiving abortion pills through the mail. By December 2023, 19% of abortions took place through telehealth – but by December 2024, that share had risen to 25%. In the last three months of 2024 alone, more than 70,000 abortions were performed through telehealth. These abortions are particularly popular in states with large rural regions, such as Montana, Nevada and Hawaii. Much of the increase in telehealth abortions can be attributed to the spread of “shield laws”. Enacted by at least eight states since Roe’s fall, these controversial laws are designed to protect abortion providers who treat women in states with bans from prosecution by those states. Demand for shield-law abortions has soared over the last two years. In July 2023, when the first shield-law abortion providers started operating, they facilitated fewer than 6,000 abortions for people living in states that ban almost all abortions or that restrict telehealth abortions. In December 2024, these providers performed almost 14,000 abortions. “There’s more abortion taking place in Mississippi today than there was prior to Dobbs,” said Dr Angel Foster, a co-founder of the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project (Map), which uses shield laws to ship abortion pills out to about 2,500 patients a month. “That really speaks to how little access some folks had to in-clinic abortion care prior to Dobbs and how shield law provision and telemedicine has really stepped into that space.” #WeCount also collected information on how many abortions were reported to government authorities in states with abortion bans in 2024. On average, states where abortion is totally banned saw just 30 in-person abortions a month, #WeCount found. All abortion bans permit abortions in emergency situations, but activists have long contended that that bans’ exceptions are written so narrowly and vaguely that they are unworkable in practice. Since Roe fell, dozens of women have come forward to say they were denied emergency abortions. In Upadhyay’s view, the #WeCount data backs up the claim that exceptions don’t work. “That seems very low,” Upadhyay said. “That is something that I think states with abortion bans should be paying attention to and be concerned about.” The future of shield laws is now in doubt, as anti-abortion activists are trying to test their durability in court. Texas has sued a New York doctor over accusations that she mailed abortion pills to a woman in Texas, while Louisiana has indicted the same doctor for allegedly mailing a pill to that state. Access to the common abortion drug mifepristone is also under assault. Martin Makary, the FDA commissioner, and Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, have called for a “review” of mifepristone, which is typically used in telehealth abortions – and which has been deemed safe by more than 100 studies conducted across dozens of countries. Kennedy specifically cited the results of a flawed analysis pushed by anti-abortion groups that claimed the complication rates from taking mifepristone are higher than previously known. “Clearly, it indicates that, at very least, the label should be changed,” Kennedy told the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, during a congressional hearing. For now, however, Foster remains optimistic about the future of her work. “There will be a point where growth stops. There’s a finite number of people who have an abortion each year,” Foster said. “But I do think within our practice and within the shield law space we are anticipating that there will continue to be growth in demand.”","2025-06-23T14:58:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/abortions-data-since-roe-wade"
"abortion","Trump ally Marsha Blackburn launches bid for governor of Tennessee","The Republican senator Marsha Blackburn announced on Wednesday she will run for governor of Tennessee. A staunch ally of Donald Trump who represents a state he carried by nearly 30 percentage points, Blackburn would become the first female governor in Tennessee’s history if she wins next year. The vocal abortion foe supported Trump’s baseless claims of fraud during the 2020 election, and was considered one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives during 16 years representing a district in middle Tennessee. “Trump is back, America is blessed, and Tennessee: better than ever,” Blackburn said in her campaign launch video, which opens with a shot of a clapping Trump and features several images of them together. “I love Tennessee. I believe in Tennesseans, and I’m ready to deliver the kind of conservative leadership that will ensure our state is America’s conservative leader for this generation and the next.” Echoing Trump’s rhetoric, she promised to “define our boys and girls the way God made them”, deport undocumented immigrants, “whether it takes planes, trains or starships”, and “deliver a world-class education for our children by empowering parents, not the deep state”. A former state senator, she was elected to the House in 2002, then became Tennessee’s first female US senator in 2018. She championed legislation to strip all abortion providers of federal funding, and was among the Republican senators who announced they would vote to oppose the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, but changed her mind after the January 6 attack. Blackburn was last year challenged for re-election by the Democratic state representative Gloria Johnson, who was one of the “Tennessee Three” protesters in the state house. The senator was elected to a second term with 64% of the vote. If she wins the race for governor, Blackburn may be able to appoint a successor to her Senate seat. She faces Congressman John Rose in the Republican primary, though other candidates could emerge. Last week, NBC News reported the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, was considering running for the office. Axios reports that Trump’s pollster Tony Fabrizio believes Blackburn will be the “clear frontrunner” in the race, with 82% of GOP primary voters viewing her favorably.","2025-08-06T16:08:24Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/marsha-blackburn-governor-tennessee-campaign"
"abortion","Mixed ruling leaves Missouri abortion rights in limbo despite ballot measure","More than two months after Missouri residents voted to add abortion rights into their state constitution and overturn the state’s ban on the procedure, abortions have not yet resumed in Missouri – and it’s not clear when they will, according to a key Planned Parenthood official in the region. The day after the election, Missouri Planned Parenthood affiliates filed a lawsuit asking the court to eliminate a slew of abortion restrictions that, the affiliates said, made it impossible to perform the procedure. On Friday evening, the Jackson county circuit court judge Jerri Zhang ruled that several restrictions, including the state’s near-total ban, were “clearly contrary” to the state’s new constitutional amendment and could not be enforced. However, Zhang left other laws in place, including a requirement that abortion clinics be licensed by the Missouri department of health and senior services. In order to obtain that license, clinics must have extra-large hallways and rooms. Planned Parenthood called those rules “medically unnecessary” in court papers and said that many of its facilities do not meet those standards. As long as they are in place, Emily Wales, president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates in Missouri, is not sure when her clinics will be able to start performing abortions. The organization is now weighing its legal options – as it may ask Zhang to re-examine her ruling, go to a higher court seeking relief or attempt to apply for a license from the state. “The misperception people may have now is that we could just apply and reopen our doors,” Wales said. But, she added: “It was so weaponized when we had to get licensure from the state. The state would delay. They would force us to litigate to get a license.” Two Planned Parenthood abortion clinics had to stop providing the procedure back in 2018 – years before the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and allowed Missouri to ban almost all abortions – because the clinics could not come to licensing agreements with the Missouri state government. Voters in seven states passed pro-abortion rights ballot measures in November, but abortion rights activists are now in the process of making those measures’ promises real. Because the measures do not automatically strike down abortion restrictions, advocates are now hoping that lawsuits or new legislation may be used to do so. In Arizona, the state’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has agreed not to enforce the state’s 15-week abortion ban while litigation over Arizona’s pro-abortion rights ballot measure plays out. Unlike Arizona, however, Missouri’s state government is dominated by Republicans. Despite voters’ support for abortion rights, state lawmakers have already filed at least 11 anti-abortion bills. “I would have been more surprised if they hadn’t,” Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, told the Guardian ahead of Friday’s ruling. “But we have an opportunity to look forward. A big goal will be making sure people have access to accurate information, because part of what they’re doing with all of these new attacks is trying to scare people. We know that fear and confusion itself is a barrier to care.” Zhang’s mixed ruling has already left patients confused, according to Wales. After the judge issued her decision, over the weekend, some patients called to ask for abortion appointments in Missouri, only to be told that they had to instead go to Kansas, Wales said.","2024-12-23T21:16:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/23/missouri-abortion-rights-ruling"
"abortion","New York adds protections for doctors who send abortion pills out of state","New York state moved to increase protections for abortion providers who mail pills out of state, days after a Louisiana grand jury indicted a New York doctor for allegedly doing just that. New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, on Monday signed into law a bill that permits doctors to request that their names be left off prescriptions for abortion pills. Instead, they can use the names of their medical practices. “In deeply conservative states, they’ve weaponized the courts against providers, in state and out,” Hochul said in a press conference. She continued: “Other states, they want to target, harass, scare, intimidate doctors and patients. That may be OK in a place like Louisiana, maybe Indiana. But those are not our values in the state of New York. No.” The new law arrives in the wake of intensified efforts to prosecute providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortions to residents of states with abortion bans. These providers operate under the auspices of “shield laws”, which have been enacted in a number of blue states since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. They generally aim to protect abortion providers by refusing to comply with red-state requests to prosecute them. Shield laws have proven vital to maintaining abortion access in the US post-Roe. Between April and June of last year, providers offered nearly 10,000 abortions each month through shield laws, according to data from #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. However, shield laws have gone largely untried in courts – and red states are now aiming to put them to the test. Late last year, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based provider, who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to a 20-year-old Texan. Carpenter is also the subject of last week’s indictment by a Louisiana grand jury, which alleges she prescribed a pill in that state. Louisiana law-enforcement officials also indicted the mother of a minor who was allegedly given the pill. On Monday, Hochul vowed: “Never, under any circumstances, will I sign an extradition agreement that sends our doctor into harm’s way, to be prosecuted as a criminal for simply following her oath.” Louisiana discovered Carpenter’s name, Hochul said, because it was on the prescription bottle. “After today, that will no longer happen,” she said.","2025-02-04T20:18:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/new-york-abortion-pill-law"
"abortion","Nigel Farage suggests MPs should debate rolling back abortion limit","Nigel Farage has said MPs should look at rolling back Britain’s abortion limit from 24 weeks, in a signal that he could try to open up a debate about women’s reproductive rights. The Reform UK leader was speaking as he unveiled the former Conservative minister Andrea Jenkyns as the latest recruit to Reform UK, announcing she would be the party’s candidate for mayor of Lincolnshire. Responding to questions about the assisted dying bill, which he will vote against, Farage said parliament should be allowed more time “to debate things that people at home talk about”. “Is 24 weeks right for abortion given that we now save babies at 22?” he said. “That to me would be worthy of a debate in parliament but should that be along party lines? I don’t think so.” Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advistory Service, said: “Despite what anti-abortion campaigns would have MPs think, rolling back women’s hard-won rights is not what people at home are interested in.” Louise McCudden, the head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, a sexual and reproductive health services provider,, said: “Calls to reduce the time limits are based on ideology and are not supported by clinical evidence. If MPs are going to debate anything on this issue, it should be reforming our Victorian abortion laws which leave women threatened with prison for making decisions about our own bodies.” McCudden said the most common circumstances that MSI saw leading to an abortion at 22 weeks or later involved unexpected health risks during a wanted pregnancy and foetal anomalies, which are often not detected until 20 weeks or later. The Labour MP Stella Creasy said: “Ninety per cent of abortions happen in this country before 10 weeks – those rare ones that do happen later are the most heartbreaking as they often involve fatal conditions that mean much longed-for children do not survive birth.” Farage, who was bullish about his party being able to grow from its five MPs to become the official opposition in future, also told the press conference that he believed he could count on “my new friend Elon”, referring to the owner of X, Elon Musk. Farage said he was looking forward to cuts being made to the US administrative state, which he described as a blueprint for Reform UK to follow “if things go well” at the next general election. Jenkyns – who Farage said happened to be the 100,000th Reform member – joined the party leader on stage at a central London hotel where she said her old party was a sinking ship that was beyond salvaging. Her decision to join Reform comes as a surprise, however, after she engaged in a bitter public row with the party earlier this year, after claiming a pro-Brexit businessman had offered her jobs to defect. She was bitterly critical of Reform in July after an attack by the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, who had accused her of bribing her Reform general election rival in the constituency of Leeds South West and Morley. On that occasion, Jenkyns insisted she never came close to defecting to Reform and described Tice’s “wild accusations” as “libellous” and an attempt to “deflect from his own embarrassing behaviour”. Asked on Thursday how long she had been thinking about defecting, she said she had “always respected” Farage and noted her work with Tice during the Brexit campaign. “We are politically aligned. And how long have I been thinking about it? Well, I mean, I was tempted before the general election, but I am a loyal person to a party,” she said. Jenkyns has long been a controversial figure in Tory ranks and campaigned with a picture of Farage on leaflets even while in the party. In 2022, as a newly appointed education minister, she responded to complaints after making a rude gesture outside Downing Street by saying she had been provoked by a “baying mob”. The arrival of Jenkyns coincided with an announcement by Reform’s former deputy leader, Ben Habib, that he was quitting the party in protest at what he said was the failure to “democratise,” claiming a new constitution was a “reheated” document that left Farage ultimately in full control. He also alleged that Reform UK branches had been instructed by party headquarters not to work with him or invite him to speak.","2024-11-28T15:44:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/28/nigel-farage-suggests-mps-should-debate-rolling-back-abortion-limit"
"abortion","Hundreds of US women charged with pregnancy-related crimes since fall of Roe","In the first two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, prosecutors in 16 states charged more than 400 people with pregnancy-related crimes, new research released on Tuesday found. Of the 412 cases tracked by Pregnancy Justice, the vast majority took place in the US south, targeted low-income women and involved allegations that women broke laws against child abuse, endangerment or neglect, according to the research, which was compiled by the reproductive justice group. About 300 prosecutions took place in Alabama and Oklahoma. In 16 cases, law enforcement charged women with homicide. Because there is no national database of US arrest or court records, the group believes the tally is likely to be an undercount. In a report released in September 2024, Pregnancy Justice said it had recorded 210 pregnancy-related prosecutions in the first year after Roe fell – the highest number ever recorded at that time. Pregnancy Justice is now devoting more resources to unearthing records of pregnancy-related prosecutions, so the group can’t say for sure whether these prosecutions are on the rise post-Roe or whether they are simply tracking them more closely. Nearly 400 of the cases included in the new report involved allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In an example described to the Guardian, after one woman gave birth, the hospital tested her umbilical cords for drugs. When the test came back positive for marijuana, the woman was arrested for felony child neglect, even though she had a medical marijuana card. The laws used in most of these prosecutions, Pregnancy Justice pointed out, are typically meant to protect children, not fetuses. By prosecuting pregnant women under them, the group says, states are cementing the legal doctrine of “fetal personhood”, which seeks to grant embryos and fetuses full legal rights and protections – sometimes at the cost of the rights of the woman carrying them. Alabama and Oklahoma are both hubs for the growing fetal personhood movement. “That is the ultimate goal of the anti-abortion movement,” said Dana Sussman, the senior vice-president at Pregnancy Justice, which scoured court and police records to find the cases. “It wasn’t just to overturn Roe. It is to establish full personhood, full rights for embryos and fetuses.” Sussman said a number of women have faced criminal consequences for taking substances that were legal or prescribed to them. For that reason, Donald Trump’s claim last week that pregnant women who take Tylenol may give their children autism, raised alarms. Scientific research does not support this claim. “It’s a perfect storm of all of the things that we work on: stigmatizing pregnant people for not being perfect pregnant people, blaming them for their perceived failures, and relying on misinformation and junk science to create a panic when there shouldn’t be one or isn’t one – while also increasing surveillance in the police state to monitor and potentially criminalize people when they don’t meet these impossible ideals,” Sussman said. Only 31 of the cases documented by Pregnancy Justice included a stillbirth or miscarriage, while almost 300 of the cases led to a live birth. A woman whose case was included in the Pregnancy Justice report reportedly didn’t realize she was pregnant until she started to feel intense pain in her stomach. The woman, a new immigrant to the US, suspected that she had food poisoning and decided to drive herself to the hospital. Before she could get in the car, however, the woman started to give birth. She ultimately delivered what police records listed as a stillbirth. Pregnancy Justice did not factcheck the cases in the report and could not say whether the fetus was past 20 weeks of pregnancy, after which the term stillbirth is used. After police found the remains, the woman was charged with abuse of a corpse. The report indicates there are far more cases of miscarriage criminalization than have made national headlines. In one widely covered case in late 2023, police charged an Ohio woman with felony abuse of a corpse after she miscarried into a toilet. In another, earlier this year, a Georgia woman who had been found bleeding and unconscious after a miscarriage faced one count of concealing the death of another person, and one count of throwing away or abandonment of a dead body. The charges against both women were ultimately dropped. Nine cases discovered by Pregnancy Justice involved allegations that women had considered abortions, such as ordering abortion pills or looking for information about abortion online. Only one woman in those cases was charged with violating a criminal abortion ban, likely because it is legal in most states to “self-manage” one’s own abortion. US abortion bans tend to penalize providers and people who help abortion patients, not the patients themselves. In 2025, lawmakers in at least 12 states – including Alabama and Oklahoma – introduced legislation that would treat fetuses as people, which would leave women who have abortions vulnerable to being charged with homicide. In several of those states, that charge would carry the death penalty. “What our work has proven is that, unfortunately, anything is possible when it comes to policing pregnancy,” Sussman said.","2025-09-30T13:00:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/pregnancy-us-women-crimes-study"
"abortion","Meta accused of ‘bowing’ to Trump by making abortion content harder to find","Senator Ruben Gallego has accused social media giant Meta of “presumptively bowing” to the Trump administration by making abortion-related content more difficult to find. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was accused of “shadow-banning” several non-profits who provide medication abortion to women in the US. “I am deeply concerned at the chilling effect that suppressing content related to abortion has towards women,” Gallego wrote in a letter sent to the company on Friday. “Women around the country rely on medicated abortion as safe and effective way to address deeply personal health decisions.” A dozen states across the south-east and midwest ban abortion. Four states ban the procedure past six weeks of gestation, before most women know they are pregnant. Non-profits, such as Aid Access, have responded by providing medication abortion to women in all 50 states using “shield laws” – protections passed by states friendly to reproductive rights that prevent healthcare providers from legal consequences in abortion-ban states. In Gallego’s letter, the senator describes how Aid Access had posts removed from Facebook and blurred on Instagram. The organization was also locked out of Facebook and briefly suspended from Instagram. The experience mirrors that of other medication abortion organizations, such as telehealth clinic Hey Jane, whose spokesperson told the Guardian that Instagram made its posts harder to find. Other groups, Women Help Women and Just the Pill, told the New York Times their accounts were suspended and restored. “I am also troubled by the timing of these events,” said Gallego, in the letter. “Taken together, Meta’s decision to end fact-checking, while simultaneously restricting access to content related to abortion, looks like a calculated move to avoid the ire of President Trump, a well-known opponent of both abortion and attempts to limit mis- and disinformation.” Gallego asks Meta for its “rationale” for removing content related to abortion; why it was removed “specifically in the weeks” following Trump’s election victory, and whether the removals were in “specific states” or nationally. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson told the Guardian when the removals were first reported: “These groups encountered both correct enforcement and a variety of issues, including over enforcement and a technical bug, that resulted in the blurring of some posts. But we’ve been quite clear in recent weeks that we want to allow more speech and reduce enforcement mistakes – and we’re committed to doing that.”","2025-02-03T20:19:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/meta-abortion-content"
"abortion","Loans and pawned belongings: abortion patients are increasingly going into debt","Early this fall, a woman desperate for an abortion messaged the Wild West Access Fund, an abortion fund in Nevada, asking for support. She guessed she was nearly 20 weeks pregnant and didn’t have even a few hundred dollars to spend on the procedure. She wanted to prove she was doing everything she could to raise the money, and said she was trying to pawn her vehicle. Over the next few weeks she bounced from clinic to clinic, trying to put the money together as the price of the abortion she sought continued to increase. The cost of a first trimester abortion is about $500, around $2,000 in the second, and a third trimester abortion can range from a few thousand dollars to around $25,000. Since the US supreme court eliminated federal protections for abortion, more than a dozen states banned the procedure completely, while others set gestational limits, increasing travel costs for pregnant people in those states. The woman eventually stopped replying to messages, and the fund workers don’t know if she ever received her abortion. Macy Haverda, executive director of the Wild West Access Fund, told me that even for a $600 procedure, “we have had a lot of clients that talk about having to sell off their belongings.” Abortion debt is increasingly part of the abortion landscape, whether in the form of pawning possessions, putting procedures on credit cards or taking out loans. I spoke with three different clinics, two abortion funds and several organizers – all of them have identified more debt burden falling on patients since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. To call attention to the problem, the Debt Collective, a union of debtors that has challenged the validity of student and medical debt, announced on Monday a grant of $50,000 to a group of abortion funds – organizations that help people pay for abortions and costs surrounding them, such as travel and lodging. “The Debt Collective believes that abortion access is a health justice issue,” said collective co-founder Astra Taylor in a statement. “High costs, including the costs of treatment and travel, are effectively a second ban on care.” Politically, abortion access and medical debt relief are both popular. Abortion rights ballot measures outperformed Democrats in the 2024 election, and medical debt, which plagues over 100 million Americans, is part of a for-profit system so loathed that the recent assassination of a health insurance CEO drew cheers nationwide. Lindsey Muniak, who runs the Debt Collective’s medical debt project, has described her own experience with hospital bills as “a constricting snake, a boa or a python”. No one has measured abortion debt on a national scale. While healthcare debt is often measured (inadequately) using credit bureau data that relies on unpaid bills, abortion clinics rarely bill their clients – instead taking money upfront so as not to violate their privacy later. On credit card statements, many additional costs associated with abortion look benign: travel to New Mexico or to Oregon, a hotel room for two days, takeout ordered in New York City or Baltimore. But while the precise scope of the problem is unknown, the abortion fund workers and clinic workers I spoke to for this story affirmed that as costs rise, patients are going deeper into debt. *** Part of the problem is that the network of funding sources is contracting. Large advocacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood are spending millions on political campaigns while cutting financial aid to people who need abortions. At the same time, donations to abortion funds have declined and costs are rising as bans force people to travel further for procedures pushed into later stages of pregnancy. “Folks are going into medical debt to pay for these procedures that they otherwise might have been able to access when they were cheaper,” said Lucy Font, manager of patient advocacy and coordination at the Maryland clinic Partners in Abortion Care. The result, she says, is that while other sorts of patients might borrow money from loved ones, “abortion is so highly stigmatized and now criminalized in so many places, patients are feeling really scared about revealing their pregnancy to people.” As a result, “they’re stuck borrowing it through their banks or taking out payday loans.” That patients need to fall back on bad loans is hardly surprising. A study based on data collected before the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization showed that for over 40% of abortion patients, the procedure resulted in what experts call “catastrophic health expenditures”, defined as 40% or more of participants’ ability to pay. After Dobbs, state abortion bans increased the distance that patients have to travel by hundreds of miles, bringing average travel costs well over $1,000. The Hyde amendment, a law prohibiting federal funds from paying for abortions, means that Medicaid does not cover abortions unless states contribute their own funds. Some states do, but the reimbursement rates vary widely and can be extremely low. Abortion funds, of which there are over a hundred in the United States, are mostly independent grassroots organizations sustained by donations and operating on shoestring budgets. Destini Spaeth, a care coordinator with the Prairie Abortion Fund based in North Dakota, said she helped one patient pay off a $4,500 abortion payment that she’d put on a credit card. Haverda and Spaeth often participate in what abortion funds call “solidarity pledges” in which multiple funds cobble together money for one person’s abortion. Destini said she’s seen as many as 15 funds come together to pay for a later-stage abortion. They’re all stretched to the breaking point. Victoria, a woman in her 30s who has worked with the Debt Collective, experienced the debt that can ensue when abortion funds have to triage. (She asked to use only her first name in talking about her medical history.) Victoria was studying in New York City for the bar exam when she discovered she was pregnant in 2021. The abortion added hundreds of dollars of medical debt, paid on credit cards, to Victoria’s education debt. “All of our debt,” Victoria said, “is actually connected.” The clinics that often shoulder the burden are also struggling. Independent clinics perform more than half of all in-clinic abortion care, and over 80% for abortions over 22 weeks. Their margins are razor thin. As payments from patients disappear due to abortion bans and abortion funding cutbacks their numbers have been in free fall: 76 such clinics have closed since Dobbs. Many clinics regularly discount care for desperate patients leading to deficits on the clinic’s side of the ledger. Font at Partners clinic noted that they see a lot of young people, who are less likely to know when they’re pregnant, and disproportionately likely to be survivors of incest or sexual assault. How much discounting can clinics survive? Since 1 July, Partners has discounted over $80,000 in costs. In late August, “we met with our accountants,” Font said, “and we thought that if we had continued at the rate that we were going, we would not have been operational past mid-October of now, right now of this year.” In the end, philanthropists helped them fill the hole. All of this points to a different kind of debt: that of society to the organizations that are providing health care to thousands of pregnant Americans. In April, Polish abortion activists presented a symbolic bill of €11.5m to the country’s parliament, for the activist money and labor that had gone into providing abortion care to Polish people under extremely restrictive conditions. Should activists in the US do the same, one can easily imagine the bill many times that size – the National Network of Abortion Funds alone dispensed over $36m in the year after Dobbs. The Debt Collective argues that much of the debt people carry should be regarded as a social responsibility. The collective tweeted on Monday: “Abortion is healthcare and healthcare should be free. And that abortion debt is medical debt and medical debt should be canceled and prevented from happening in the first place.” Maddy Clifford, who works on communications for the Debt Collective, joined because she had six figures of student debt and believed education shouldn’t be a burden. She said she had an abortion nearly 20 years ago in a Seattle clinic called Aradia and got a glimpse of what good healthcare could be like. The feminist doctor and administrators were kind and fit her appointment in right away, she couldn’t pay and didn’t, and the clinic assigned her an abortion doula – someone to be by her side through the process, provide comfort and answer questions. In 2007, Aradia closed after 30 years – malpractice insurance and rent were up, and too many of their clients couldn’t pay the full fee. “My abortion was free and I want that for everyone,” Clifford told me. She doesn’t want people to have to pawn a car like Haverda’s client, or fall deeper into debt like Victoria. “I’m going to fight alongside them so that they can have it.”","2024-12-22T15:00:49Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/22/abortion-patient-debt"
"abortion","The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them","As Nicola Packer lay down in shock having just delivered a foetus at home, she had no idea that her life was about to be torn apart. She had suffered a rare complication in her abortion treatment, but what followed would be far more traumatic and unexpected. Every agency she needed turned against her, treating her not as a victim but as a criminal. Compassion was replaced by cruelty. NHS staff come to work because they want to care, and Packer did find most staff at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London “amazing”. What she didn’t know is that after the matter was passed up the chain of seniority, the police were alerted. Charing Cross police station took the call seriously: it dispatched uniformed officers who promptly arrested Packer, guarded her overnight as she recovered from surgery, then kept her in police cells for another two days. Over the next four years, the police pursued the case with notable zeal, examining multiple witness statements, undertaking detailed analysis of Packer’s confiscated electronic devices and work computer, organising detailed forensics tests for more than 200 drugs, and commissioning a postmortem on the foetus that involved several specialists; multiple tissue samples and a number of organs were retained. Had it not been a time of Covid-19 lockdown and had Packer had a scan, it seems reasonably likely that this would have shown a pregnancy of less than 24 weeks, meaning she could have had a legal, uneventful abortion. It is a mystery why the police and Crown Prosecution Service felt that pursuing her for nearly five years was in the public interest, especially after the court of appeal stated that even those found guilty should be treated with “compassion not punishment”. The problem is not with callous organisations or individuals, it is that our laws directed and encouraged those actions. It is perhaps not surprising that the law promotes persecution over compassion. Its origin can be traced back to 1623, an era when women were still tried for witchcraft and more than 100 years before the last woman was burned alive at the stake. In the past few months, other women have been targeted under this ancient law after a suspected abortion – one for buying pills to induce an illegal abortion, which she denied were used and were never proved to have been used. Packer’s trial highlighted a vindictive and brutal process which weaponised victim-shaming. A system that forces teenagers and women to reveal their most intimate details and then relive their worst trauma in the full glare of the court – in Packer’s case, Isleworth crown court in west London – guarantees that their humiliation and shaming will be very public. Perhaps, for many people that’s the whole point? In some ways, she has been less unfortunate than others, including some who were investigated after suffering a natural miscarriage or premature labour. She didn’t have her children removed, she has not had to install panic alarms after receiving death threats, she did not lose her job or home, she has not been sent straight to prison. She had people who sought to help and advise her – I was one of them. In January, recognising the harm that the law is causing, more than 30 organisations, including six medical royal colleges, called on parliament to act urgently to protect women’s reproductive rights, warning that “women and girls are facing traumatic and prolonged criminal investigations following pregnancy loss and abortion in numbers never seen before”. Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour MP for Gower, is leading a cross-party group to champion the urgent need for reform. They hope to finally remove the threat of prosecution against women who act in relation to their own pregnancy. Change is urgently needed. Two months ago, Antoniazzi told the Commons: “The women caught up in this law are highly vulnerable and often desperate, yet they are subject to the same laws that also apply to violent partners who use physical abuse, coercion or poisoning to end a pregnancy without consent.” She reminded her fellow MPs that Westminster actually voted to repeal the laws criminalising women in Northern Ireland in 2019, but still they pertain to England and Wales. “There should be parity in the law across the UK so that my constituents have the same rights as my colleagues’ constituents in Northern Ireland,” she said. It may be too late for Nicola Packer and others, but the law must change so that women and girls in Great Britain can indeed expect the same rights as in Northern Ireland, Ireland, Canada, France, Australia and New Zealand. This cruelty must be highlighted and it must be stopped. We can but hope that Nicola Packer’s ordeal brings that day closer.

"abortion","International court rules against El Salvador in key abortion rights case","The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) has ruled that El Salvador violated the human rights of a Salvadoran woman who was denied an abortion despite her high-risk pregnancy in 2013. The court has ordered the Central American country to adopt “all necessary regulatory measures” so that doctors are authorised to terminate “pregnancies that pose a risk to the woman’s life and health”. The decision announced this Friday also “recommended” that El Salvador amend its laws to allow abortion “in cases of fetal incompatibility with life outside the womb, as well as where there is a risk to the life and a serious risk to the health and personal integrity of the mother”. The country has one of the world’s most restrictive anti-abortion laws: the procedure is prohibited under all circumstances, and women can even be charged with aggravated homicide, carrying sentences of 30 to 50 years in prison. Now activists hope the verdict could pave the way for the decriminalisation of abortion in El Salvador and set an important precedent for Latin America, where the procedure is prohibited under all circumstances in another six countries. Beatriz (her surname is not listed in the case) was 22 years old and living in extreme poverty when, less than a year after giving birth to her first child, she discovered a new pregnancy. She suffered from lupus, arthritis and renal failure, and the doctors soon identified that the fetus had anencephaly and would not survive outside the womb. Doctors recommended abortion to save her life, but could not do so because, as the procedure has been prohibited in the country since 1997, healthcare professionals who perform it can face up to 12 years in prison. Beatriz appealed to the supreme court, which denied her request. The case garnered international attention, and an IACHR decision obliged the Salvadoran state to allow the procedure. El Salvador still refused and only permitted her to undergo an emergency premature C-section after she became gravely ill; the fetus died five hours later. In 2017, Beatriz died after being involved in a car accident. There was a belief among activists that the deterioration of her health in 2013 had somehow contributed to her death, but the IACHR decision concluded that “there is no clear and compelling evidence that establishes a causal link” between the two cases. Beatriz became a symbol of how El Salvador’s anti-abortion law endangered women’s lives. Feminist activists and human rights advocates brought her case to the IACHR. “It is a historic moment, but it is also hopeful,” said Mariana Moisa, a women’s rights activist and founder of the Citizens’ Coalition for the Decriminalisation of Abortion. She believes that the decision established a “minimum” – that abortion should be allowed at least in cases where the woman’s life is at risk – “which allows us to progress in countries where the laws are more restrictive and also where there are setbacks and an attempt to roll back progress”. Morena Herrera, another prominent abortion rights activist in El Salvador, posted a video saying, “Justice has been served for Beatriz and her family,” and that the decision “has broadened the horizons of hope for girls, adolescents and women on our continent, because now we imagine a better present and future for all”. The court ruled that El Salvador is responsible for “obstetric violence” and violations of Beatriz’s “health, access to justice, rights, personal integrity, private life, and the right to live a life free from violence”. The decision also orders the country to pay compensation – the amount to be determined – to Beatriz’s mother, stepfather, widower and son. The IACHR is part of the Organization of American States, comprising 35 countries, of which El Salvador is a member. In practice, there is no direct obligation for the country to change its laws. Since 2022, the country has been under a controversial state of emergency to combat gangs, implemented by its authoritarian and conservative president, Nayib Bukele, who has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of changing the country’s current abortion law. “The fact that the president does not intend to decriminalise it does not mean that women will stop having abortions, right?” said Moisa, who believes the decision can contribute to the decriminalisation of abortion in El Salvador in the future. “The decision places us socially in a conversation about abortion, to bring it out of the taboo, to understand that it is a public health issue,” she said.","2024-12-20T22:14:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/20/el-salvador-abortion-death-ruling"
"abortion","US doctors describe three patient deaths that could have been prevented with abortion access in new study","Doctors who practice medicine in states with abortion bans have described in a new study how three of their pregnant patients died, but probably could have been saved had they been able to receive abortion care. The doctors, who treat lung, respiratory and other critical illnesses, never raised abortion, including the option of traveling out of state for the procedure, out of fear of legal repercussions, according to interviews with the doctors in the study, which was published in Chest, a medical journal. No other information about the patients who died was published. The study, led by the researcher Katrina Hauschildt at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, sought to understand how abortion bans put in place after the supreme court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade affected specialist doctors outside the field of obstetrics and gynecology, where most research has been focused. “While these downstream consequences [on pulmonary and critical care physicians] have been hypothesized, little systematic empirical data exists on the impact of these policies on patients with pulmonary and/or critical illness and their physicians,” the study said. The research, based on interviews with more than two dozen pulmonary and critical care physicians, who work in 15 states with abortion bans, described “repeated experiences of restricted and delayed treatment” of their patients, impacts to training, concerns about ways abortion bans had “disparate impacts across social groups”, and their own moral distress at navigating abortion laws. In one case, treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, which is by definition nonviable, was delayed, resulting in “hemorrhagic shock”, a doctor reported. “This study clearly demonstrates the immediate and wide-spread harm that abortion bans are having on pregnant people. Even in states with ‘exceptions’ to the abortion ban, doctors’ hands are tied until it is too late and severe outcomes, including preventable death are happening,” said Dr Caitlin Bernard, an Indiana-based obstetrician-gynecologist and reproductive and abortion rights activist. Bernard added: “While some cases are deemed newsworthy, these daily injuries and death are not even counted, much less made public. Nobody will ever know how many women have been harmed or died because of abortion bans preventing appropriate medical care.” The interviews took place between October 2022 and July 2024 and included physicians practicing in Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas, among other states with strict abortion restrictions. (Missouri has since restored some abortion access following a ballot initiative held in November 2024.) In one case, a doctor who was interviewed described how a patient with a congenital heart defect, who began having symptoms of health issues at 18 weeks, first presented at a local hospital. The doctor said: “Abortion at that point probably would have prevented [life-threatening disease] progression,” but was never discussed with her. She was then transferred to critical care physicians to “try to get her to the 22-week mark” so that she could have a viable fetus. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she began to have respiratory failure, the doctor said. “We got her to 22 [weeks] … they performed a C-section and took the fetus. The baby survived, but I think she left the [intensive care] unit on a ventilator … and I just remember [her husband] saying: ‘I’m not sure this is what she would have wanted.’” Four of the 29 doctors who were interviewed said they did not believe they were allowed to discuss abortion at all with their patients. Of those, two who were interviewed said a total of three of their patients had died. One of those doctors – who had two pregnant patients die – said one patient had been a mother from a large family with several children already, whose disease had “in theory” been well-controlled during pregnancy. But she did not survive delivery. “You know, you felt a little bit like your hands were tied because you’d want to counsel termination – not carrying the pregnancy forward, but with the restriction placed in the state, you’re not really sure if that counseling could be a reason that you get in trouble with the legal system, or your license is put under question, because there are rules in other states where that does happen,” the doctor said. In another case involving a pregnant patient whose treatment was delayed, a doctor described how the patient had an ectopic pregnancy but doctors were unsure of “whether it had fully ruptured”. “She spent about 12 hours in the emergency department with it not being clear whether anyone could perform surgery or not, and then developed hemorrhagic shock and went to surgery and had an OK outcome,” the doctor said, “but had an obvious delay in care that was almost certainly a result of the [abortion restriction] and the uncertainty around what is an imminent threat in the life of the mother.” The doctor added that the patient received blood products she probably would not have needed if the delay had been avoided. Some delays in care occurred because more people have become involved in care decisions as the legality of medical decisions are determined, the study found. In one case, delays occurred because pharmacies required a discussion with a physician before pulmonary medication that could result in miscarriage was dispensed. “[Previously] … there would be no involvement of other people. So it definitely invokes a delay in care. One hundred per cent, like at least two or three hours is delayed, because we have to involve these extra people to make sure that we do [decide and document] correctly, and we guess we just hope that two or three hours is OK,” one doctor said. The physicians also pointed to inequities in patient populations. “We have a huge group that are very poor, very uneducated, maybe not native speakers, and don’t have those abilities [to get out of state abortion care]. So for that group, there are no options,” one doctor said. Physicians reported feeling unsure of whether they would be supported by their medical institutions if they faced legal scrutiny for helping patients obtain pregnancy terminations. The research found that most felt they would be supported by colleagues, but were unsure about their institutions, which sometimes receive funding from the state. Do you have a tip?

"abortion","RFK Jr faces questions about U-turn on abortion in US Senate hearing","Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s nominee for health secretary, faced questions about his flip-flopping on reproductive rights in a US Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Kennedy identified as “pro-choice” during his presidential campaign as a Democrat, but said repeatedly in Wednesday’s hearing for secretary of health and human services (HHS) that he agreed with Trump that “every abortion is a tragedy”. “I agree with him that we cannot be a moral nation if we have 1.2 million abortions a year. I agree with him that the states should control abortion,” Kennedy said in response to questions from Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, where abortion is banned. “I serve at the pleasure of the president. I’m going to implement his policies,” he continued. Kennedy also reassured Republicans in private conversations that he had changed his position on the issue. In December, Josh Hawley, a Republican senator of Missouri, said that Kennedy had told him he would “reinstate President Trump’s pro-life policies at HHS”. Key to Kennedy’s testimony was the pledge to investigate the safety of mifepristone, one drug in a so-called medication abortion. The drug has been the focus of attacks by anti-abortion campaigners since the fall of Roe v Wade, and is now the most common way to end a pregnancy. The drug has been extensively investigated for safety, and it is found to have fewer adverse outcomes than acetaminophen (paracetamol), a common over-the-counter pain reliever. Key studies that supported a recent supreme court case over mifepristone’s approval in the early 2000s have been retracted. “We need to understand the safety of every drug – mifepristone and every other drug,” Kennedy said, adding that Trump had not yet taken a position on the medication, but that he had made it clear to Kennedy that he “wants me to look at the safety issues”. Democrats produced placards of Kennedy’s past pro-choice statements, including one campaign statement reported by the Hill that read: “Mr Kennedy’s position on abortion is that it is always a woman’s right to choose. He does not support legislation banning abortion.” “I have never seen any major politician flip on that issue quite as quickly as you did when Trump asked you to become HHS secretary,” Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, told Kennedy. Sanders asked, rhetorically: “Tell me why you think people should have confidence in your consistency and in your work when you really made a major U-turn on an issue of that importance?” Maggie Hassan, a Democratic senator of New Hampshire, suggested she and Kennedy actually agreed on the issue of abortion access, citing and referencing his many past comments in support of reproductive rights. As she questioned Kennedy, Hassan’s staff displayed posters that highlighted his previous remarks in support of abortion access. One poster quoted Kennedy saying: “I’m pro-choice … I don’t think the government has any business telling people what they can or cannot do with their body.” “You said that, right?” Hassan asked Kennedy, to which he replied: “Yes.” “It is remarkable that you have such a long record of fighting for women’s reproductive freedom and really great that my Republican colleagues are so open to voting for a pro-choice HHS secretary,” Hassan said. She then asked Kennedy: “You have clearly stated in the past that bodily autonomy is one of your core values. The question is: do you stand for that value or not? When was it that you decided to sell out the values you’ve had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?” Kennedy reiterated: “Senator, I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy.” Jessica Glenza and Joanie Greve contributed reporting","2025-01-29T19:20:33Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/rfk-jr-abortion"
"abortion","Georgia supreme court reinstates six-week abortion ban","Just one week after a Georgia judge restored broad access to abortion in the state by blocking its six-week abortion ban, the Georgia supreme court ruled on Monday to reinstate the ban. The ban will take effect at 5pm local time on Monday and remain in effect while litigation over it plays out. Abortion rights supporters quickly condemned the decision, which also came down weeks after news broke that two Georgia mothers, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, died after being unable to access legal abortions. “Every minute this harmful six-week abortion ban is in place, Georgians suffer,” Monica Simpson, executive director of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, said in a statement. SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective is a plaintiff in the legal battle over the ban. Simpson continued: “Denying our community members the lifesaving care they deserve jeopardizes their lives, safety, and health – all for the sake of power and control over our bodies.” Last week, the Fulton county superior judge Robert McBurney ruled that Georgia’s six-week ban, which outlaws abortion before many people even know they are pregnant, is unconstitutional. “Women are not some piece of collectively owned community property the disposition of which is decided by majority vote,” McBurney wrote in his fiery 26-page opinion. “Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted, not-yet-viable fetus to term violates her constitutional rights to liberty and privacy, even taking into consideration whatever bundle of rights the not-yet-viable fetus may have.” McBurney’s ruling permitted Georgia abortion providers to perform abortions up until about 22 weeks of pregnancy. In the week that the six-week ban was not in effect, abortion clinics and their supporters said interest in abortion appointments increased. However, Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, quickly appealed McBurney’s ruling. On Monday, only one judge dissented in part from the ruling to reinstate the ban. One judge did not participate, while another had been disqualified from taking part in the case. “Fundamentally, the state should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,” Justice John Ellington wrote. “The ‘status quo’ that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.” In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, more than a dozen states have banned most or virtually all abortions. Abortion has also become a major issue in the presidential elections – including in Georgia, which Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are jockeying to win.","2024-10-07T18:36:24Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/georgia-supreme-court-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Amazon donates to group backing hardline anti-abortion Republican","Amazon, DoorDash and CVS Health are among major US companies publicly committed to supporting reproductive rights that have nonetheless contributed this year to a group supporting the re-election of Todd Rokita, the Republican attorney general of Indiana who supports a total abortion ban. He was also reprimanded by his state supreme court for criticizing a doctor who provided an abortion for 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio. The corporate donations, detailed in publicly available filings, were made to the Republican Attorneys General Association, or Raga, a “527 committee” – a tax-exempt political campaign group so-called in reference to the US tax code. It exists to funnel nationally donated funds into key state races. In 2024, Amazon, Doordash and CVS Health between them have donated $425,000 to Raga. And Raga has given $255,000 to Rokita, who has also participated in a suit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over accommodations for workers receiving abortions; signed amicus briefs in a US supreme court challenge to Food and Drug Administration approval of mifepristone, an abortion pill; and sought access to private health records, in order to prosecute women seeking abortions. Altria, AT&amp;T and Comcast are also among major public companies that publicly support reproductive rights while donating to Raga, which supports campaigns for attorney general across the US. (In 2024, Altria has given $450,000, AT&amp;T $125,000 and Comcast $125,000.) Donations to Republican and Democratic 527 committees have long been tracked by the Center for Political Accountability, a Washington thinktank, which highlighted the donations to Raga and Rokita. In August, in an introduction to a CPA report, Bruce Buchanan, a professor of business ethics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said of 527 committees: “Their power far exceeds their media presence. The American citizenry has little awareness of their influence, and even less of their funding and methods. This is unfortunate. “… As major corporations open their checkbooks to these 527s – and especially to the Republican Attorney Generals Association (Raga) – these funds are going to elect and re-elect state officials that are actively advancing policies antithetical to stakeholder groups across society.” Many major US companies made public statements about support for employees in light of Dobbs v Jackson, the 2022 US supreme court ruling that removed the federal right to abortion, and the ensuing state bans. In May 2022, after Dobbs was leaked, Amazon told employees it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses for non-life-threatening treatment including abortions, if an operation was not available within 100 miles of an employee’s home. In 2024, with stringent post-Dobbs bans in place in Republican-run states including Indiana, where Rokita has advocated for a total ban, Amazon has given Raga $150,000. In June 2022, shortly after Dobbs, a DoorDash spokesperson said the company would cover “certain travel-related expenses” for employees forced to travel out of state for abortion care, adding: “It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have equitable, timely access to safe healthcare.” This year, Doordash has paid $150,000 to Raga. CVS Health has said it is committed to “making out-of-state abortion healthcare services more accessible and affordable” for employees in states with abortion bans. In 2024, it has given Raga $125,000. The pattern of companies donating through Raga to Rokita – and other politicians at odds with professed corporate values – is repeated regarding climate policy. Amazon, Doordash and CVS Health are also publicly committed to action to combat climate change. In Indiana, Rokita has been prominently involved in lawsuits against the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission over carbon emissions standards. None of the companies responded to requests for comment. Last year, in response to Guardian reporting about donations to 527 committees used for efforts to pass a strict abortion ban in North Carolina, a spokesperson for the software giant Intuit outlined one corporate defense. “Our financial support does not indicate a full endorsement of every position taken by an individual policymaker or organization,” the spokesperson said. “Intuit is non-partisan and works with policymakers and leaders from both sides of the aisle to advocate for our customers. We believe engagement with policymakers is essential to a robust democracy and political giving is just one of the many ways Intuit engages on behalf of its customers, employees, and the communities it serves.” In the same report, a Bank of America spokesperson said 527 committees could only use its donations for “operational and administrative purposes, not to support any candidates or ballot initiatives”. The CPA argued that given 527 committees exist to elect governors, attorneys general and other state officials, that is a distinction without a difference. In a statement to the Guardian about donations to Raga by companies publicly committed to supporting rights Republican attorneys general have attacked, Bruce Freed, president of CPA and a co-author of the 2024 report, said: “Today’s political environment makes it even more important that companies have policies and a framework in place for approaching, managing and evaluating the risks of political spending. “They need this to give them control over their spending and to protect themselves.” Mike Schmul, the chair of the Indiana Democratic party, said his party’s candidate against Rokita, Destiny Wells, was “the only candidate in the race for AG who has received the support of Hoosiers first, not special interests and out-of-state mega-donors. “Todd Rokita is out of touch with the issues that matter, attacking women and doctors, and threatening the medical privacy of Hoosiers. The choice is clear.”","2024-10-31T18:00:26Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/amazon-doordash-cvs-fund-anti-abortion-republican"
"abortion","The day Roe died: inside Arkansas’s last abortion clinic","Eight patients were in the waiting room of the Little Rock Family Planning Services clinic on the morning in June 2022 that Roe v Wade died. Until that moment, the clinic was the only place where women in Arkansas, a deeply red state, could get surgical abortions. Natalie Tvedten, who helped found the clinic and provided counseling to patients, remembers huddling in a back room with a visiting doctor from Los Angeles after they heard the news. Usually, patients would undergo a two-day procedure. But the doctor working that day made the call that they could not start any terminations. He was beside himself, Tvedten said. “He broke down. I am talking broke down,” she said. “We pulled the patients back and started explaining to them that it was no longer legal to give them abortions in Arkansas and that we would find them care elsewhere.” Their best options involved travel to Kansas, New Mexico or Illinois. The Guardian on Tuesday published an investigation about how rightwing forces successfully blocked a ballot measure that would have rolled back the Arkansas abortion ban ushered in by Roe’s demise. Alongside that story, we are also publishing this story about Little Rock Family Planning Services, and accounts from women who were served there. Tvedten has never talked about that day, but agreed to share her memories with the Guardian. She was sometimes overcome by emotion describing how events unfolded, and how it abruptly brought to an end the work she said the clinic did over decades to empower women to make their own reproductive choices. “It was a horrifying day. I am still not over it. A lot of these women have spouses or partners that are just not supportive. For some of these women, it is the first time it has been acknowledged they exist,” she said. Three patients did not want to leave, she said. Some had already traveled from out of state, including Texas, Florida and Tennessee. There were 16 others who were on their way in. Some were begging, she said, for doctors to perform the abortions anyway. Staff explained that they could not break the law. “A lot of women said, ‘I am going to get this done,’” Tvedten said. Karen Musick, an escort who worked at the clinic, helping women walk through the throng of ever-present protesters outside its doors, said one protester with a bullhorn started reading the supreme court ruling – known as the Dobbs decision – out loud. Dobbs triggered a total abortion ban in Arkansas. It was shocking but not surprising. A draft of the ruling had already leaked in the media, and the clinic staff ramped up in anticipation of the decision, trying to treat as many women as possible. “We were on a marathon, we were going to try to do 200 abortions by the end of June,” Tvedten said. The clinic still exists but the protesters have left. It no longer offers abortions. But the remade facility, called the You Center, offers women resources if they need abortions: including sharing a phone number they can call to have abortion medication shipped to them from out-of-state providers, and helping them find financial support to leave the state for the procedure. Recently, two 13-year-old girls came to the clinic for help and were able to travel out of state for their abortions. Musick – the one-time abortion escort – is now co-founder of the Arkansas Abortion Support Network, which runs the You Center. On its website, the AASN offers practical advice, including how visitors to the website can clear their browser and search history. “Most people in Arkansas are going to Illinois and a lot of them are going to Kansas. We want people to get care where they are most comfortable getting it,” said Musick. Now the clinic is facing a new problem, and it’s one that has hit similar centers in red states where abortions have been banned: money is running out. Initially, the AASN benefited from what Musick calls “rage giving”. When the Dobbs draft leaked, the organization raised $100,000 – more than it ever had before. When the opinion officially came out, it raised another $100,000, and by the end of the year it had taken in $780,000. In 2023, that figure sharply dropped to just under $400,000. The AASN pays for patients’ out-of-state care – sometimes up to 70% or the whole cost, if needed. It also has to pay for staff salaries. But the need for spending has continued to increase, and donations have not kept up. Musick said her group mostly takes in smaller donations from individuals – the average is $18 – but large donations are starting to dry up nationally. “I think a lot of big-dollar donors thought we would be a lot closer to normal by now, but we’re not. I think most people understand that it’s not sustainable to have to send people from south Texas to Colorado, but they didn’t see or understand how deeply abortion is embedded in politics,” Musick said. Among the relics of the abortion clinic is a journal that used to be kept in the waiting room. It was a place where patients could tell their stories and read those of others. Sometimes women left encouraging notes for one another. Now it reads like notes from a bygone era. The Guardian read dozens of journal entries provided by the clinic’s former staff, who redacted any identifying details. The accounts differ dramatically: women sharing painful stories about abusive boyfriends and husbands; others who said they could not take on the responsibility and financial burden of a child; those who said they were just getting their life in order or are going to school; and some who were devastated after receiving news that their pregnancies were not viable because of fetal anomalies. The women are now bound together by one fact: none could have had an abortion in Arkansas today. “I just had a child a few months ago after missing birth control. Pregnancy was a nightmare. It was honestly worse than I expected. I have never been so mentally &amp; physically ruined. I’m doing this for numerous reasons but your reason is just as important!” wrote one woman. Another said: “I’m 18, and am 13 weeks &amp; 2 days today. In fear of not being the person I want to be. I am giving my baby to the Lord. Knowing not having the right parents can affect you forever. I feel it is only fair to you to give you a life &amp; love one day but this is not the right time. I have to learn to love me first so I don’t mess up with you, baby.” Another wrote: “I use to be against abortions but until you get in that seat you just have to do what is best for your life. I’m still learning how to be a mom to my 3 yr old.”","2024-10-29T13:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/arkansas-last-abortion-clinic-closed"
"abortion","Texas judge fines New York doctor for mailing abortion pills to patient in Texas","A Texas judge has ordered a New York doctor to immediately stop prescribing and mailing abortion pills to patients in Texas, setting up a challenge to state “shield laws” that could reach the US supreme court. In his order Thursday, Judge Bryan Gantt of Collin county district court ordered Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter of New Paltz, who uses telemedicine to see patients across the country, to cease her work and pay a penalty of more than $100,000. The lawsuit was filed by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, a close ally of Donald Trump, in December. The case, which challenges the strength of “shield laws” established to protect physicians offering abortion care, is widely believed to be headed for the supreme court. Such laws emerged after the court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 – and signify a growing divide among states since then. On Thursday, New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, said the state would not cooperate with an extradition request for Carpenter, filed by Louisiana officials in a separate case. The Texas lawsuit alleges that Carpenter provided a 20-year-old woman with the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol. After the woman sought follow-up care at her local emergency room, the “biological father of her unborn child” filed a complaint with the attorney general, according to court records. The anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life has encouraged men to report instances when they believe their partners may have received such abortion care, and file wrongful death lawsuits against the physicians and friends who provided assistance. A separate Louisiana lawsuit, the first criminal indictment of its kind, accuses Carpenter of sending the same pills to a pregnant teenager in that state. “I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana – not now, not ever,” Hochul said on Thursday. Carpenter has not commented directly on either case, but an organization she leads, called the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, released a statement on Thursday, saying: “Today’s extradition order from a prosecutor with an anti-abortion agenda is the latest escalation in Louisiana’s ongoing state-sponsored effort to prosecute safe and effective healthcare.” It added: “Ongoing attempts by anti-abortion state officials to restrict access to abortion care are inconsistent with New York state law.” Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry, who signed the warrant for Carpenter to appear in court there, posted about the case on social media on Thursday: “There is only one right answer in this situation: the doctor must face extradition to Louisiana where justice will be served.” Shield laws Over the last five months of 2023, medical providers shipped abortion pills to more than 40,000 people living in states that forbid abortions via “shield laws”. Since 2022, 23 states and Washington DC have enacted such laws to protect providers offering reproductive healthcare, according to the University of California, Los Angeles. The laws represent a departure from previous interstate legal agreements. The laws vary in scope state-to-state, with New York’s declaring that state and local entities may not cooperate with, or provide information or use resources in furtherance of, an out-of-state investigation of any “legally protected reproductive health activity”. It also prohibits the state’s governor from recognizing any extradition requests. As a result of that wording, Carpenter and her attorneys did not respond to the Texas lawsuit or appear in court on Wednesday for a hearing before the judge, according to the New York Times. In a previous statement, Carpenter’s organization said: “Shield laws are essential in safeguarding and enabling abortion care regardless of a patient’s ZIP code or ability to pay.” At a press conference regarding Louisiana’s extradition order on Thursday, Hochul told reporters: “We have put in place strict shield laws that anticipate this very situation.” Texas was the first state to initiate such legal action challenging shield laws, and the Louisiana case against Carpenter is the first such criminal indictment. Such laws could end up before the supreme court if Texas files a petition in New York state court to collect the financial penalty it ordered Carpenter to pay. Alongside a $100,000 fine and about $13,000 in attorneys’ fees and court costs, the Texas judge also ordered Carpenter to immediately cease prescribing and mailing abortion pills. Violating an injunction can result in a contempt order that may carry additional financial penalties. • The last paragraph of this article was amended on 14 February 2025. The judge is from Texas and not New York, as an earlier version said.","2025-02-14T02:13:13Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/texas-abortion-pills-shield-laws-new-york-doctor"
"abortion","As Trump returns, state lawmakers pursue bills that would treat abortion as homicide","Legislators in at least four states have introduced bills this year that would change the legal definition of “homicide” to include abortion – proposals that pave the way for states to charge abortion patients with murder. Pregnancy Justice, a group that tracks these kinds of efforts, says it has recorded more “homicide” bills this year than ever before. Abortion bans have typically penalized providers, rather than patients. “That raises significant alarm – both that we’ve seen more than we have in the past in a single legislative session already, and that they’re not generating the level of outrage or attention or scrutiny that they have in years past,” said Dana Sussman, senior vice-president at Pregnancy Justice. “The more of these kinds of bills that get introduced, people get numb to the idea of them, and they seem less and less radical.” With Donald Trump returning to power in Washington DC, abortion rights supporters and opponents are waiting to see how the new president will handle one of the most divisive issues in US life. But red-state lawmakers have already filed a host of anti-abortion proposals over the last few weeks. In addition to the “homicide” bills, many of these bills target access to abortion pills – which account for more than 60% of US abortions – and seek to limit minors’ ability to obtain abortions. In at least two states, Montana and Missouri, lawmakers are also seeking to implement legislation that would in effect roll back the abortion protections guaranteed by recent ballot measures. Last year, when elections loomed over legislators’ heads, states passed fewer abortion-related laws than they had in the five years prior, according to the the Center for Reproductive Rights. But this year, Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute, suspects that lawmakers will take Trump’s victory in 2024 as a green light to pursue anti-abortion policies more aggressively. “There’s generally going to be an emboldening of state legislators who are opposed to reproductive and sexual health and rights, given the new administration,” Forouzan said. ‘Homicide’ and ‘fetal personhood’ Bills that redefine abortion as “homicide” strengthen a legal doctrine known as “fetal personhood”, which seeks to grant embryos and fetuses legal rights and protections – sometimes at the expense of the women carrying them. If fully enacted, fetal personhood would not only ban abortion but would rewrite entire arenas of US law, from traffic regulations to taxes. So far in 2025, lawmakers in at least six states have introduced bills to strengthen fetal personhood, while Trump has tucked fetal personhood language into one of his executive orders. The “homicide” bills have been introduced in Indiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Carolina. The Oklahoma bill not only explicitly strips away protections that keep abortion patients from being prosecuted, but also separately prohibits anything that may “direct, advise, encourage or solicit” an abortion. That language, Pregnancy Justice worries, could have implications for free speech rights. It may be used to attack abortion funds and supporters sharing information with people in need. The Oklahoma bill was co-authored by the Republican state senators Dusty Deevers and Warren Hamilton, who both belong to a far-right movement known as “abortion abolitionism”. While the mainstream “pro-life” movement shies away from the idea of punishing women for having abortions, abortion abolitionists believe that if abortion is murder, then abortion patients should be treated like murderers and punished accordingly. “I think we’re going to start to see those exceptions for pregnant people start to be repealed, so that pregnant people can also be criminalized under states’ total abortion bans,” said Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “All of this, I think, for most people, feels pretty hypothetical – unless, of course, they or a loved one or a friend are living in a banned state and has needed access to care. But it’s critical to say anti-abortion folks have made their ultimate goals clear.” Limits on abortion pills In the years since Roe fell, anti-abortion activists have lobbed attack after attack on abortion pills, or medication abortion, which are increasingly facilitated by the mail. In spring 2024, more than 19,000 abortions were provided each month through telehealth appointments, which rely on the mail to deliver the pills, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. “Mailed medication abortion is an existential threat to the anti-abortion movement,” said Rachel Rebouché, the dean of Temple University’s law school. “It’s hard to police.” Red states, however, are going to try. Indiana, which bans virtually all abortions, has introduced three separate bills that would ban people from sending abortion pills to individuals in the state. One of those bills also outlaws the possession of abortion pills. Over in Oklahoma and Tennessee, which ban almost all abortions, lawmakers have introduced similar bills that would also ban people from mailing abortion pills – and, in the case of the Tennessee bill, hold them liable for $5m if those pills were used in an abortion. One of the Indiana bills would also reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol, the drugs typically used in US abortions, as controlled substances. That bill mirrors a similar proposal in Texas, where abortion is banned and where lawmakers have also introduced a bevy of bills to stop the flow of abortion pills. Both efforts also follow in the footsteps of Louisiana, which last year became the first state in the country to categorize mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances. That move, doctors warned, could endanger women’s lives, since the drugs can treat postpartum hemorrhage and other conditions. Limits on minors’ abortion access In 2023, Idaho became the first state in the country to ban people from taking minors across state lines for abortions without parental consent – a practice lawmakers dubbed “abortion trafficking”. Lawmakers in Mississippi, Missouri and New Hampshire are taking up Idaho’s mantle with similar legislation that restricts people from helping minors get abortions through pills or by helping them travel to a state where the procedure is legal. (Mississippi bans virtually all abortions, but it is currently permitted in New Hampshire and Missouri.) Another bill in South Carolina – which permits abortion up until six weeks of pregnancy – proposes eliminating a legal process known as judicial bypass. For decades, minors have used this process to ask courts to grant them the right to undergo the procedure without involving their parents. Abortion rights supporters warn that restrictions on minors’ access to abortion typically foreshadow wider restrictions. “Every ban that we have seen on adult access to care started with a ban on youth access to care,” Smith said last month.","2025-01-23T17:23:24Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/abortion-homicide-bills"
"abortion","Emboldened anti-abortion groups create wishlist for second Trump term","The anti-abortion movement is ready for its comeback in 2025. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, complete with a Republican-dominated Congress, anti-abortion groups are unfurling ambitious lists of policies they hope to see enacted under a sympathetic administration. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the movement has largely been relegated to playing defense. Popular support of abortion rights surged, while red-state voters defended abortion rights through ballot measures and many Republicans downplayed their opposition to the procedure. Now, they are ready to go back on the offense. Earlier this week, the powerful Students for Life of America released its wishlist of federal legislation, entitled “Make America Pro-Life Again”, which takes direct aim at access to abortion pills. The group is backing federal bills that would ban abortion pills entirely, outlaw telehealth abortions and require medical-grade cleanup of the pregnancy remains left behind by medication abortions. (Students for Life argues that the pills pose a threat to the US water supply because people may pass the remains of their pregnancy into the toilet.) Currently, abortion pills account for roughly two-thirds of US abortions. “There’s going to be a willingness to listen, there’s going to be a willingness to have conversation,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, said of the incoming Trump administration. On the campaign trail, Trump was far from a loyal ally to the anti-abortion movement. Although he bragged that he was the “most pro-life president” ever and took credit for Roe’s demise – having appointed three of the justices that overturned it – he also repeatedly insisted that abortion was now a matter for states to decide. Trump also flip-flopped on whether he would veto a national abortion ban passed by Congress. But he wouldn’t necessarily have to. In an interview with the Guardian, Hawkins said she believed the Trump administration should enforce the Comstock Act – which may be the easiest way for a Trump administration to effectively implement a nationwide abortion ban. A 19th-century anti-vice law that bans the mailing of abortion-related materials, the Comstock Act was dormant while Roe v Wade was the law of the land, but has never been fully repealed. It could be used to ban the mailing of abortion pills, as proposed by Project 2025, the controversial playbook of conservative policies assembled by the thinktank the Heritage Foundation. In the second quarter of 2024, providers performed more than 57,000 abortions through mail-order prescriptions, according to data from #WeCount, a project to track post-Roe abortions by the Society of Family Planning. But other abortion opponents think the law can be used to stop abortion clinics from obtaining all of the materials they need to do their jobs. Joe Biden’s Department of Justice has issued guidance that offers a more lax interpretation of the Comstock Act. But a Trump justice department, led by Matt Gaetz, could easily rescind that guidance without involving Congress. Gaetz’s record on abortion has earned him an A+ from the powerful anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America. “The letter of the law should be followed,” Hawkins said. Pointing to Trump’s proposals on immigration, she said: “The incoming Trump administration has been very clear that laws in our country are there for a reason, and laws should be upheld.” She added: “We are going to be a country of law and order.” In a statement, Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, seemed to echo the point. “The commonsense policies of Pres Trump’s first term become the baseline for the second, along with reversing the Biden-Harris administration’s unprecedented violation of longstanding federal laws,” she said. Dannenfelser’s statement also included a laundry list of policies that she would like to see implemented, many of which would involve redirecting federal funds. For example, she called for Trump to reinstate a rule that would reshape the nation’s oldest family planning program, Title X, which helps people obtain services such as contraception and STI screenings at little to no cost. Most people who rely on Title X are women and have incomes that are below or around the poverty level. Although a longstanding rule known as the Hyde amendment already blocks federal dollars from funding abortions, the Trump administration also implemented a rule that blocked Title X-funded family planning providers from mentioning the word abortion and required them to physically separate any services that involve abortion from those that don’t, such as by creating entirely separate waiting rooms, examination rooms and office entrances solely for abortion provision. Rather than comply, about 1,200 family planning clinics – including every clinic run by Planned Parenthood, the anti-abortion movement’s greatest antagonist – left Title X. More than 1.5 million people are thought to have lost access to Title X services as a direct result of the Trump administration’s changes. In a strategy memo issued earlier this week and shared with the Guardian, Dannenfelser indicated that her group would work to lay the groundwork for “fetal personhood”, a legal doctrine that would grant embyros and fetuses full legal rights and protections. “In order to go on offense and truly defeat the abortion industry in the long term, we must strengthen the pro-life, pro-woman, pro-family resolve of the Republican Party, centered on the unalienable right to life for the unborn child that exists under the 14th Amendment,” Dannenfelser said in the memo. Some abortion foes cite the 14th amendment as the legal foundation for fetal personhood. If fully enacted, it would not only ban abortion entirely but rewrite vast swaths of US law, such as by outlawing in vitro fertilization as it is currently practiced. Alabama offered a sneak peek at what this may look like when the state supreme court ruled earlier this year that embryos created through IVF are “extrauterine children”. The ruling temporarily threw fertility services in the state into chaos. A fresh mandate There are other ways that anti-abortion activists may strike at abortion pills in the coming months. Earlier this year, the US supreme court rejected a lawsuit, argued by the Christian legal powerhouse Alliance Defending Freedom, that aimed to roll back the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, the common abortion pill. That rejection, however, was based on technical grounds. Three states – Idaho, Kansas and Missouri – are now attempting to resurrect the case. The Republican attorneys general of those states have filed a new complaint that repeatedly cites the Comstock Act and pushes for new restrictions, such as limits on minors’ access to the abortion pill. But Project 2025 suggested another workaround: what if, under a conservative administration, the FDA reversed its own approval of mifepristone? Such a move could make it much harder to obtain the pill in the United States. The FDA could also roll back later measures that have made the medication more accessible without reversing course on its approval entirely. Hawkins enthusiastically endorsed that course of action. The key, she said, may lie in the 2024 supreme court case Loper Bright Enterprises v Raimondo. In that case, the court’s conservative supermajority struck down the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine, which required courts to defer to federal agencies’ expertise. “The supreme court confirms what we knew all along: federal agencies are not God,” Hawkins said. “They do not get the power to create their own regulations and enforce their own laws.” In their own post-election statements, Alliance Defending Freedom affirmed their commitment to “dismantling the administrative state”. The election ultimately proved to be a mixed bag for abortion rights: despite Trump’s victory, voters in seven states passed ballot measures to amend their state constitutions to protect abortion rights. In Arizona and Nevada – both of which Trump won – those measures passed with a whopping 60-plus per cent of the vote. Still, Hawkins feels like the 2024 election issued a clear mandate to her movement and the US government. “Americans want less abortion. They don’t want more,” Hawkins said. “No matter what type of color lipstick you want to put on this pig, you’re still talking about abortion.”","2024-11-17T12:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/17/anti-abortion-groups-trump-2025"
"abortion","Missouri abortion rights in legal limbo after constitutional protections take effect","An amendment to Missouri’s constitution protecting the right to abortion took effect late on Thursday, two years after the state banned the procedure – but abortions have not yet resumed in the state. The day after Missouri voters supported the measure to amend the constitution, Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state filed a lawsuit asking the court to strike down the state’s near-total abortion ban as well as a raft of other restrictions that, Planned Parenthood said, make it impossible to perform the procedure. In a hearing on Wednesday, the groups asked the Jackson county circuit judge Jerri Zhang to quickly issue an order to freeze the restrictions and allow abortions in the state to resume on Friday. However, the judge has not acted, and Missouri abortion providers remain in legal limbo, caught between contradictory provisions in the state’s constitution and its statutes. Under the new amendment 3, Missouri residents possess a “fundamental right to reproductive freedom”, including access to abortions until fetal viability. “I think it’s a simple case. I don’t think we are asking for something particularly extraordinary,” said Emily Wales, president of Planned Parenthood Great Plains in Missouri. “We have Missouri providers who travel to Kansas currently to provide care. It’s absolutely their hope to provide abortion services in their home state. So as soon as we get notice, we will rearrange our plans to ensure that Missourians have access to care.” Even before the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, paving the way for Missouri to ban abortion outright, abortions in Missouri had dwindled dramatically. One Planned Parenthood affiliate had stopped offering the procedure altogether, while the other could only do so at a single clinic, according to Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit. This decline was due, the lawsuit alleges, to a series of “impenetrable, onerous and medically unnecessary restrictions” that are still technically in place – such as requiring medication abortion patients to undergo a vaginal exam or mandating that abortion patients visit a clinic for counseling, wait 72 hours and then return for the procedure. Without a favorable court order from Zhang, Wales said: “There will be too many restrictions on the books that we just can’t actually comply with.” Andrew Bailey, Missouri attorney general, has said that amendment 3 means its near-total abortion ban is unenforceable. However, other restrictions can remain in place, including the requirement of a “72-hour reflection period”, Bailey argued in a recent court filing. Removing those requirements would infringe on women’s right to choose childbirth, he said, which is also included in amendment 3’s guarantee of “reproductive freedom”. “Regulations that ensure individuals have adequate time to choose between options – and will not be racked by regret – do not ‘delay’ rights under amendment 3; those regulations foster those decisions,” he wrote. Bailey argued that, rather than issuing a court order that would impact numerous abortion restrictions, Zhang should instead let these restrictions’ futures be decided over the course of litigation. With amendment 3’s impact in question, Missouri state legislators this week proposed a number of potential new restrictions. Lawmakers pre-filed at least 11 anti-abortion bills, according to a tally by the Kansas City Star. The state legislature may take up these bills when it reconvenes in January 2025. Republicans will control the state house, senate and governor’s mansion. One pre-filed bill would once again ask Missouri voters to amend the state constitution – this time to outlaw all abortions except in medical emergencies or in cases of rape. Another would endow embryos and fetuses with full rights and protections – a measure that, if enacted, would grant them a status known as “fetal personhood” and in effect ban all abortion. Yet another would ask voters to amend the Missouri constitution to, in the future, make it more difficult to pass ballot measures. Under that proposal, ballot measures would have to win both a simple majority of voters and win a majority of voters in more than half of the state’s congressional districts. (Right now, Missouri ballot measures must only win most voters in the state.) Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, remains committed to fighting these new efforts. “I think these attacks are only going to further enrage voters who just made a very clear decision,” Schwarz said.","2024-12-06T18:52:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/06/missouri-abortion-rights-amendment"
"abortion","‘I was right to be frightened’: Nicola Packer on the humiliation and trauma of her trial for illegal abortion","“I hate sitting in silence now,” Nikki Packer says. A quiet room reminds her too much of the police cell she was locked into just hours after undergoing a traumatic stillbirth. Arrested in hospital by uniformed officers while still recovering from surgery, she was accused of carrying out an illegal abortion. It took four-and-a-half years for her case to come to court, where last week she was unanimously cleared by a jury. Packer, 45, was charged with “unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing” with the “intent to procure a miscarriage”, after taking abortion pills prescribed to her by a registered provider during the November 2020 Covid lockdown. Under emergency legislation introduced during the pandemic – and later made permanent – medication could be dispatched by post for pregnancies up to 10 weeks’ gestation. Packer went on to deliver a foetus estimated to be about 26 weeks’ gestation. The prosecution had claimed she had known she was more than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the pills; an allegation Packer has always denied. She may have been found not guilty, but Packer knows she will never be the same; she is nervous of seeking medical help now. At her trial, the prosecution tried to claim she was lying when she said she did not initially tell medical staff (who went on to call in police) that she had taken abortion pills because she was afraid it would affect the quality of care she received. “But they didn’t really help me, did they?” she says. “So I think I was right to be frightened.” And she no longer trusts the police – when her phone died, and she needed help, she asked the drunk man outside a London station for directions, rather than a police officer. She also knows she has not yet fully processed the enormity of what happened to her. Just days after the verdict “I’m still running on adrenaline”, she says. But she is seeking answers from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Met police as to how she got here. “There are other ways that it could have been handled after I’d been in hospital,” she says. “I could have been sent home to recuperate. There was no legal need for me to be taken straight to a police station. “It was absolutely horrific to get to from the hospital to Charing Cross police station,” she added. With no cars available, she was put in the back of the police van, and “I had to sit basically on a plank of wood, with no seatbelts on it, driving around London like that.” In custody, she was not given her anti-clotting medication on time, told it was “not a priority”. “I was still in pain, I was extremely tired, I felt very weak and mentally, just did not really understand what was going on,” she said. The prosecution clouded her life for almost half a decade. “I kept doing things, but you’re not fully present in the moment,” she says. She spent tens of thousands of pounds on her defence. A crowdfunder helped to meet at least some of her costs. “I read all [the comments] several times,” she says. “I was reading them in the run-up and during the trial as well. There are so many people out there that don’t believe this should be happening, there’s so much support.” Years before her case ever reached Isleworth crown court, Packer’s barrister, Fiona Horlick KC, asked her what she was most of afraid of. “I’m most scared going to prison,” she says. The next worst thing, was “the trial, just giving evidence and having to be speaking in front of all these people”. She knew she had the option to plead guilty, but she did not consider it for more than a “split second”, she says. “I couldn’t have looked at myself doing that, because it wasn’t true.” While she waited for her case to come to court, she saw another woman, Carla Foster, convicted of, and jailed for, an illegal abortion before her sentence was suspended by the appeal court. “I was really angry, angry that she had to go through this,” Packer says. “She spent 35 days in prison. Why? Who did that help? What was the point? There was no point in sending her to prison, and then you have to think about the impact on the rest of her life.” But the case also brought home the reality of what she was herself facing, and she began asking questions she had never imagined having to contemplate. “How do I prepare for the worst outcome?” she says. “Do I rent my flat out and cancel Netflix? What do I do? I don’t know. I’ve never been in this situation before.” “The rational part of your brain can tell you it’s unlikely to happen, but then the other part … it still could happen,” she adds. “So it’s a horrible thing to live under, and the fact that it comes with a potential life [sentence] in prison.” When Packer’s trial finally came around at the end of April, the prosecution opening including details of her sex life, which included her alternative relationships. “It was completely unnecessary, and it was just done to make me look bad,” she says. “And potentially you’re dealing with something that people may never have heard of, wouldn’t understand, may have a bad opinion of. It was completely not needed.” At one point, Packer was forced to sit in court while lawyers discussed the size of her nipples with the judge. Intimate photographs of her were shown to the jury; evidence of her flat stomach. “It was quite humiliating,” she says. “I didn’t want anybody to see those photos, but I knew that it was for my own good. “We hid what we could, but because my nipples were such a hot topic, we couldn’t blank them out in pictures,” she says. “It’s not nice knowing that people have seen such intimate pictures of you.” “It was horrendous giving evidence, absolutely awful,” she says. “It was very upsetting, I spent most of the time crying while I was doing it, but I got through it because I knew that I was right.” And the jury agreed, finding her not guilty after about six hours of deliberations. “It was just wonderful to get that verdict,” she said. “I just feel that although the last four and a half years been absolutely horrific, I don’t know if I could say at the moment it was worth it, but to have that validation of being found unanimously not guilty by a jury of my peers, it’s an amazing thing.” Having cleared her name, Packer is now throwing her weight behind the voices calling for a change in the law that would decriminalise abortion. A parliamentary vote is expected on the issue as early as this summer. “I do hope that the law does get changed – it should do,” she said. “Abortion is healthcare. It should not be treated as anything other than that.” A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the profound strength of feeling these cases evoke, but have a duty to apply laws passed by parliament fairly and impartially.” They said the CPS’s role had not been to decide whether Packer’s actions were right or wrong, “but to make a factual judgment about whether she knew she was beyond the legal limit when she procured an abortion”, and it had considered there was enough evidence to take the case to court. Regarding the sharing of sensitive details and intimate images in court, the CPS spokesperson said this was often part of the justice process. In Packer’s case it was done, “by both the prosecution and defence, to establish the timing of her pregnancy and her understanding of the gestation period when she accessed abortion medication”. “It is never our intention to publicly embarrass or humiliate anyone with the evidence we put forward,” they said. Packer says such prosecutions “could happen to anybody, I think that’s what’s really scary about it. With the law being as it is, a tragic accident and you’re up on trial, and it’s why the law needs to change.” Packer wants to make history as the last woman in England to be prosecuted for an abortion. She has heard of other women whose cases are in the early stages of the criminal justice system, and she wants to use her voice to ensure they never see the inside of a courtroom. “I can’t really say it was worth it,” she says, “but at least it would have meant something.” Aside from campaigning for legislative change, how does Packer plan to move on from this? “That is a very good question,” she says. “I do feel a bit like I need to find myself again.” While awaiting trial, she sought comfort in familiar music and television; she listened to the same albums from her favourite rock artists on repeat, rewatched her favourite series’ back-to-back. But she found she could no longer watch Orange Is The New Black. “I had to turn it off,” she says. “I couldn’t watch it any more because I started to get a really eerie feeling; this is set in a prison, I might go to a prison.” But, she adds: “I started re-watching it last night.”","2025-05-14T16:50:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/13/i-hate-sitting-in-silence-now-nicola-packer-on-clearing-her-name-after-the-trauma-of-her-abortion-trial"
"abortion","This anti-abortion leader is building on ‘the ultimate victory from the supreme court’","Dozens of anti-abortion activists streamed into the conference room of a Washington DC hotel. They jostled for seats as speakers, dotted throughout the room, blasted a song about the need to be “a little more like Jesus, a little less like me”. By the time a trio of advocates, assembled on a dais at the front of the room, started to talk about the “Future of Chemical Abortion in America”, the title of one of the first seminars at the National Pro-Life Summit, it was standing room only. When it was Erik Baptist’s turn to address the crowd, he said: “Chemical abortion is the No 1 priority and issue of our time, for the life movement,” using the anti-abortion movement’s lingo for medication abortion, which is performed with pills. Baptist is in a rare position to do something about it. Since July, Baptist has led the Center for Life at the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), one of the foremost conservative advocacy organizations in the US. Formed in 1994, the ADF is today the rightwing answer to the American Civil Liberties Union. The legal group’s attorneys are at the forefront of virtually every conservative cause du jour, such as campus free speech, access to gender-affirming care and, of course, abortion. The ADF played a critical role in demolishing Roe v Wade, as it helped craft the model bill that became the Mississippi abortion ban that overturned Roe. But its lawyers have also been a part of recent supreme court cases over access to abortion pills and emergency abortions. As the Center for Life’s director, these kinds of efforts are now within Baptist’s purview. “We do have a comprehensive approach to lawsuits and what we’re trying to do. We’re obviously trying to win in courts and try to protect as many unborn lives as we can and support mothers who [are] in unplanned pregnancies. And how we execute that manifests itself in multiple ways,” said Baptist, who is also senior counsel at the ADF and served as one of the Environmental Protection Agency’s top lawyers during Donald Trump’s first term. He added: “We have brought cases on behalf of pregnant centers, sidewalk counselors, pro-life doctors, and we’ll continue to do that.” In an interview a few days after the summit, Baptist laid out many of the ADF’s priorities for 2025 – and the organization is poised to have a big year. In December 2024, a petition by ADF attorneys convinced the supreme court to hear oral arguments in Kerr v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, a case that could determine whether states can refuse to send Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. Defunding Planned Parenthood, the anti-abortion movement’s arch-nemesis, has long been one of the movement’s most cherished goals. Then there’s the fight over the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, known as Emtala, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients who arrive at their doors in emergencies. The Biden administration said that Emtala also covers emergency abortions, but ADF attorneys have joined Idaho – home to one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans – in fighting that interpretation. That case went all the way up to the supreme court last year but, like the abortion pills case, is now continuing in a lower court. The ADF is also involved in at least two other cases over Emtala. Baptist walked summit attendees through the “future of chemical abortion litigation”, which, he predicted, will be divided between two lines of lawsuits. One line follows a case, originally filed by the ADF on behalf of anti-abortion doctors, that targets the Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the abortion pill mifepristone. The ADF argued the case all the way to the supreme court – only for the high court to rule 9-0 that the anti-abortion plaintiffs lacked the legal standing needed to bring the case. Earlier this month, however, a Texas federal judge agreed to let three states resurrect the case. That judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, offers a keyhole glimpse into ADF’s far-reaching network. A Trump appointee, Kacsmaryk once worked for a Christian advocacy group that received grants from the ADF. Graduates of an ADF program for law students have interned and clerked for his chambers. Graduates from the same program have also clerked for supreme court justices Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett – the latter of whom, prior to her ascension to the supreme court, had spoken five times at an ADF program designed in service of a “distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law”. Baptist told attendees at the summit, who included many high school and college students, that the future of the mifepristone case looks rosy. “I frankly think the supreme court will be annoyed with those blue states, such as California and New York, trying to undermine the promise of Dobbs,” he said, in a reference to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, the case that overturned Roe. “I’m looking forward to the future of that litigation.” The ADF, Baptist added in an interview, is “no longer involved” with the case. “But we do support those efforts,” he said. The second line of litigation will focus on efforts to take down blue-state shield laws, which are intended to protect abortion providers who mail abortion pills across state lines. Between April and June of last year, providers offered nearly 10,000 abortions each month through shield laws, according to data from #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. Texas, Baptist noted at the Summit, recently sued a New York doctor for allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a Texan. On Friday, a Louisiana grand jury indicted the same doctor for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill in the southern state. “They need to be taken down, too,” Baptist told summit attendees of shield laws. The divide between states like New York and Texas will, he said, “probably, again, create a constitutional crisis. And again, I think the supreme court’s not going to be happy.” In 2023, the first full year after Roe fell, the US saw more than 1m abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortions and restrictions on the procedure. It was the largest number recorded in more than a decade – which has infuriated anti-abortion activists and led them to heavily target abortion pills, which account for roughly two-thirds of US abortions. With Trump now in office, Baptist believes that lawsuits may not be necessary to implement anti-abortion aims. “The executive branch, on its own accord, without litigation, can do the right thing as well,” he said in an interview. Under Trump, he indicated, the Food and Drug Administration could roll back its own approval of mifepristone, yanking it from the market. But if the ADF has to sue, it will. “Since 2011, we have won 15 times at the US supreme court, and ultimately a lot of our lawsuits end up there,” Baptist said. “So you may have losses along the way, but when you have the ultimate victory from the supreme court – that’s the most important one to judge our cases by.”","2025-02-01T20:12:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/anti-abortion-activists-supreme-court"
"abortion","‘Unprecedented’ rise in abortion prosecutions prompts call for law change from medical leaders","Medical leaders are calling for reform of abortion laws in England and Wales after an “unprecedented” rise in women and girls being prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies. More than 30 groups – including the British Medical Association, the Faculty of Public Health, the British Society of Abortion Care Providers and the royal colleges of GPs, nurses, psychiatrists, midwives and anaesthetists – issued a joint statement warning that the current legislation is causing “trauma and cruelty” and demanding “immediate action” to safeguard reproductive rights. The intervention, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), comes after cases where women were prosecuted for illegal abortions under a Victorian-era law that remains in place today. Six women have appeared in court over the past two years under the Offences against the Person Act. There had previously been only a handful of known convictions since the law was introduced in 1861. It is a criminal offence to have an abortion after 24 weeks or without approval from two doctors, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The groups, which represent about 800,000 healthcare professionals, are calling for a halt to prosecutions, saying abortion should be a healthcare issue, not a criminal one. Backed by 20 legal experts and charities including Women’s Aid and Liberty, they suggest the change could be made as an amendment to the crime and policing bill, set to be introduced to parliament in the spring. They also call for a new bill to modernise abortion legislation, “so it can be managed through the same robust regulatory and quality monitoring processes as all other healthcare”. “Women and girls are facing traumatic and prolonged criminal investigations following pregnancy loss and abortion in numbers never seen before,” they said. “We call on parliament as a matter of urgency to ensure women in England and Wales have the same protection as those in Northern Ireland by removing them from the threat of prosecution in relation to their own pregnancy.” The call will put pressure on MPs amid rollbacks of abortion access in other countries, such as the US, and ramped up activity from anti-abortion activists in Britain. In the last parliament there were several attempts to restrict access, including an amendment to cut the legal limit from 24 weeks to 22. The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has signalled his desire for MPs to look at cutting the limit. Labour MPs including Jess Phillips and Diana Johnson – both now Home Office ministers – have been vocal about their support for modernising abortion laws. Before the election, Johnson tabled an amendment seeking to decriminalise it, backed by cross-party MPs including Phillips. However, some Labour figures urged caution about the bill, fearing it would embolden anti-abortion activists and lead to a rolling back of telemedicine, the remote provision of clinical services. Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the RCOG, said: “The large majority of the public agree that it is not in the public interest to prosecute women for ending their own pregnancy. “No woman should be forced to continue a pregnancy against her will. No woman should face the threat of jail, or the distress of an investigation or prosecution for ending a pregnancy, or for experiencing unexpected or unexplained pregnancy loss.” Dr Andrew Green, chair of the British Medical Association’s ethics committee, said: “Criminalisation of abortion care belongs in a different era. It can discourage women from seeking safe healthcare when they need it, leading to unnecessary illness and suffering.” Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “The RCGP supports the decriminalisation of abortion and believes a change in the law is long overdue. It does not make sense that women can be prosecuted due to antiquated laws that were created before women were even allowed to vote.” Campaigners say the proposed changes would not lead to deregulation of abortion. But the approach would stop women being prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies – bringing the law into line with countries including Northern Ireland, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and France, where it is decriminalised. While abortion is accessible and prosecutions are uncommon, it is still a criminal offence in England and Wales to procure an abortion under the 1861 law. There are exemptions under the 1967 Abortion Act, which permits abortion when two doctors agree continuing the pregnancy would be risky for the women’s physical or mental health. But the old law was never repealed. The Observer previously revealed police have launched dozens of investigations into suspected breaches of the law in the past decade, including cases where women bought abortion pills online and drank herbal remedies without medical supervision. In one case in 2021, a 15-year-old girl who had an unexplained early stillbirth was subjected to a year-long investigation that saw her texts and search history examined, according to records released under freedom of information laws. The case was dropped after a coroner concluded natural causes ended the pregnancy. In another case, in Norfolk, a woman was hospitalised after swallowing eight misoprostol tablets – used with mifepristone to induce abortion – which had not been obtained through a doctor. She was thought to be 26 weeks pregnant, two weeks past the legal limit. In the 10 years to April 2022, police in England and Wales recorded at least 67 cases of procuring an illegal abortion, the FoI data shows. In most the women were not charged because it was not considered to be in the public interest. But in some recent cases, women have faced prosecution. In December, Sophie Harvey, 25, was given a community order after admitting to conspiring with her partner to buy abortion pills to end her pregnancy when she was 19. The case took six years. In 2023, Carla Foster, 44, was jailed after admitting ending her pregnancy beyond the time limit during a coronavirus lockdown. Her 28-month sentence was later reduced to 14 months and suspended, with judges saying her case called for “compassion, not punishment”. In January 2024, Bethany Cox, 22, was found not guilty of an illegal at-home abortion after a three-year investigation. Prosecutors dropped the case due to “evidential difficulties”. The reason for the apparent rise in prosecutions is not clear. But Prof Sally Sheldon, an expert in abortion law at Bristol university, said greater awareness of medical abortions after the launch of telemedicine services had likely led to heightened vigilance among healthcare professionals. Reporting on illegal abortion cases had likely also led to greater awareness of the law, she said. “Any time we have one of these cases there is a massive amount of publicity, so that can fuel it,” she said. Campaigners say the impact of investigations can be “profound”. In several cases, women have had their children removed from their family and contact banned or severely restricted. It is common for mobile phones and computers to be seized. “Even if charges are not brought, the impact of the investigation causes life-changing harm to women and their families,” said Dr Jonathan Lord, an NHS gynaecologist and co-chair of the RCOG abortion taskforce. “Many cases do not proceed to a prosecution, but it can take years before the case is dropped.” Shila Keshvari, a criminal defence lawyer with expertise in abortion law, said “young teenagers” and abuse victims were among those investigated over alleged illegal terminations. “Many have gone into hospital for a stillbirth and before they know it, the police have turned up to arrest them. The impact is long-term mental health trauma,” she said. The government did not comment on the calls for new legislation. A spokesperson said abortion was an “extremely sensitive issue” with “strongly held views on all sides of the discussion”. “That is why, by longstanding convention, any change to the law would be a matter of conscience for parliamentarians rather than the government.” It said prosecutions were a matter for the CPS. A CPS spokesperson said cases, though rare, were often “complex and traumatic” and that prosecutors considered each one carefully. It said prosecution numbers reflected the cases referred to it and that court backlogs meant some cases charged pre-pandemic had only recently been heard. The National Police Chiefs’ Council said investigations were only initiated where there was “credible information to suggest criminal activity … often as a result of concerns raised from medical professionals”, and were “always treated … with sensitivity and compassion”. Labour MP Stella Creasy, a vocal campaigner on reproductive rights, said: “We cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of women are still being investigated in often the most gruelling circumstances, having had a late-term miscarriage, or not even knowing they were pregnant at all. Instead of a counsellor, they get a police officer visiting them.” Dr Janet Barter, president of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health, said: “A change to the legislation is long overdue.”","2025-01-12T07:00:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/12/unprecedented-rise-in-abortion-prosecutions-prompts-call-for-law-change-from-medical-leaders"
"abortion","Judge strikes down North Dakota’s ban on abortion","A state judge struck down North Dakota’s ban on abortion on Thursday, saying that the state constitution created a fundamental right to access abortion before a fetus is viable. In his ruling, state district judge Bruce Romanick also said that the law violated the state constitution because it was too vague. Romanick was ruling on a request from the state to dismiss a lawsuit filed against the ban in 2022 by what at the time was the sole abortion clinic in North Dakota. The clinic, Red River Women’s Clinic, has since moved across the border to Minnesota, and the state argued that a trial would not make a difference. Romanick had canceled a trial set for August and the judge cited how North Dakota’s constitution guarantees “inalienable rights”, including “life and liberty”. The abortion statutes at issue in the case infringed “on a woman’s fundamental right to procreative autonomy, and are not narrowly tailored to promote women’s health or to protect unborn human life”, Romanick wrote in his 24-page order on the case. He added: “The law as currently drafted takes away a woman’s liberty and her right to pursue and obtain safety and happiness.” In 2023, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled legislature revised the state’s abortion laws, making abortion legal in pregnancies caused by rape or incest, but only in the first six weeks of pregnancy. Under the revised law, abortion was allowed later in pregnancy only in specific medical emergencies. Soon after that, Red River Women’s Clinic, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine, filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs alleged the abortion ban violates the state constitution because it is unconstitutionally vague about its exceptions for doctors, and that its health exception is too narrow. Even though there are now no abortion clinics in North Dakota, Dr Ana Tobiasz, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and plaintiff in the case, stressed that Romanick’s Thursday ruling will help patients in medical emergencies. Although the North Dakota ban technically allowed abortions in some emergencies, its wording was so sweeping that doctors in the state frequently felt like they could not help patients unless they got dangerously sick, Tobiasz told reporters on a Thursday press call. “We have been made to choose between saving a patient’s life and possibly facing jail time,” Tobiasz said. “We are finally free to put our patients’ health first.” Due to procedural delays, North Dakota’s abortion ban remains in effect in the state. Staffers at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which litigated the case, do not yet have a firm sense of when abortion will become fully legal again in North Dakota. The North Dakota state government may also appeal Romanick’s ruling, while the state legislature could try to pass a different abortion ban. The conservative-dominated US supreme court’s stunning decision to overturn Roe v Wade in June 2022 abolished the national right to abortion, but it has triggered a state-by-state battle for abortion rights that is far from over. More than a dozen states have banned almost all abortions. Abortion-rights supporters have fought back, however, by seeking to overturn or suspend bans in the courts and by trying to get votes on abortion rights on state ballots. Voters in several states, including GOP strongholds like Kansas and Kentucky, have voted to preserve abortion rights. Several states are likely to hold ballot measures on abortion rights during the November elections, including key battleground states like Arizona and Nevada, which may help decide the race for the White House. Kamala Harris has made abortion one of the central planks of her campaign while Donald Trump – whose judicial appointments to the supreme court allowed Roe to be overturned – has recently tried to back-pedal on the issue.

"abortion","US prosecutors keep charging women with ‘pregnancy-related crimes’","The pregnancy police are racking up arrests Every 74 seconds, someone in the US is sexually assaulted. And every nine minutes that ‘someone’ is a child, according to statistics collated by the anti-sexual violence non-profit Rainn. Instead of sending alleged sex offenders to court, the Trump administration seems more interested in putting them in positions of power. Less than 4% of reported rapes, sexual assaults and child sexual abuse allegations in certain cities across the country ever lead to a sex crime conviction, an NBC News investigation from earlier this year found. To reiterate: that’s reported assaults. By some counts, nearly 80% of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported. Don’t be too hard on the justice system, though. After all, police and prosecutors have got far more important things to think about than rapists. Namely: locking up pregnant women. According to new research by Pregnancy Justice, prosecutors in 16 states charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes in the first two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. What, you may be wondering, is a pregnancy-related crime? Good question! Most of the cases included in the new report involved low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy. In one case described to the Guardian, a woman was arrested for felony child neglect after giving birth when a drug test came back positive for marijuana. The woman in that case had a medical marijuana card. While substance use during pregnancy is obviously a serious issue that can result in long-term harm to the baby, research suggests that criminalization actually worsens health outcomes. What is most worrying about this post-Roe trend of “pregnancy-related crimes”, however, is that the laws used in most of these prosecutions are meant to protect children rather than fetuses. What we are seeing here is a growing acceptance of the idea of “fetal personhood”, which grants fetuses and embryos the full rights of a legal person. According to Pregnancy Justice, at least 24 states include language around “fetal rights” in laws regulating or prohibiting abortion care. You can see where this is going, right? We’re headed towards the increased surveillance of pregnant people and the criminalization of any behaviour the Trump administration might unilaterally consider “dangerous”. Taking Tylenol during pregnancy, for example. “What our work has proven is that, unfortunately, anything is possible when it comes to policing pregnancy,” a spokesperson from Pregnancy Justice said. For a terrifying glimpse of America’s future, look to El Salvador, which an increasing number of experts are warning could serve as a model for the US. Ever since 1998, there has been a total abortion ban in El Salvador, even when the life of the mother is at risk. Pregnancy is aggressively policed and there is what Amnesty International has termed a “guilty until proven innocent” approach when it comes to women who suffer pregnancy-related complications. Although having a miscarriage or a stillbirth is not technically illegal, a recent investigation by the journalist Maria Hinojosa found El Salvadorian prisons are full of women who lost their babies. One woman who was incarcerated for a miscarriage told Hinojosa that she estimates “90% of the women who are in prison in El Salvador are in prison for this”. While that’s obviously an observation rather than hard data, it’s still frightening. Donald Trump has made his admiration for El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, the self-described “coolest dictator in the world”, and his repressive regime very clear. Increasingly, the two countries seem to be in lockstep. While there’s been a global trend towards liberalizing abortion laws, for example, only four countries have bucked this trend and rolled back abortion rights in the past 25 years: the US, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Poland. The arc of the moral universe, as we all know, is long. But in an increasingly authoritarian and misogynistic US, it does not seem to be bending anywhere near justice. Spain seeks to make abortion a constitutional right On Friday Spain’s leftist government said it was planning on following France’s lead and making abortion rights constitutional. “With this government, there will be no backtracking on social rights,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X. Conservatives rush to explain how being pro-death penalty is pro-life “Someone who says I’m against abortion but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,” Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV said this week. “And someone who says I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life.” The rightwing political commentator Matt Walsh immediately rushed to explain that, actually, the pope’s argument is “moral madness” and the “death penalty is pro-life”. So many mental gymnastics going on there, he deserves a medal. Megachurch pastor pleads guilty to child sexual abuse Robert Morris, who joined the White House spiritual advisory committee during the first Trump presidency, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl in Oklahoma in the 1980s. Women dominate the World Cheese Competition Finally, some gouda news: the Philadelphia cheesemonger Emilia D’Albero and teammate Courtney Johnson recently won first place at the Mondial du Fromage in France, a competition sometimes known as the “Cheesemonger Olympics”. “My teammate … and I are the first all-female team USA,” D’Albero said. “They had never sent two girls before.” The ‘motherhood penalty’ is very expensive Mothers in England lose an average of £65,618 ($88,392) in pay by the time their first child turns five, new figures show. Israel is paying social media influencers $7,000 a post to whitewash genocide The campaign is nicknamed “Esther Project” and is coordinated by a company called Bridges Partner, Responsible Statecraft reports. This is part of a wider initiative, costing hundreds of millions, to rehab the country’s image. If Russia were paying influencers $7,000 a post, I’m fairly sure it would be covered by every media outlet in the US, but basically nobody has bothered reporting on this. Rightwing men love airing their grotesque Greta Thunberg fantasies The Newsmax Australia broadcaster Daniel Lewkovitz tweeted about how he hopes Thunberg, who was among flotilla activists detained by the Israeli military this week, gets tortured. “I want Greta Thunberg terrified,” Lewkovitz wrote. “I want her screaming and begging for it to stop. I want her rocking in a corner, covering her eyes. pissing and shitting in her pants.” Lewkovitz is just the latest in a long line of male pundits and politicians to publicly wish harm on Thunberg. In June, for example, the Barstool Sports CEO, Dave Portnoy, said he hoped a missile hits Thunberg. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham also publicly fantasized about the aid ship Thunberg was on sinking.

"abortion","Prayer and prosecutions: the US ‘hate group’ waging war over Britain’s abortion clinic buffer zones","Rachael Clarke remembers life before buffer zones. Almost every day, the head of staff at the UK’s biggest abortion provider would get emails from staff worried about protesters outside clinics – and women crying in the waiting room. Some of the protesters had huge placards with graphic images of foetuses. Others held candlelit vigils and said prayers. One scattered baby clothes in the bushes. “We had everything from people telling women that having an abortion was putting their baby in a meat grinder to people following nurses down the road in the dark telling them they were killing babies,” says Clarke. Since buffer zones were rolled out nationally late last year – building on public space protection orders that were already in place outside some clinics – she says things have drastically improved. Reports of alleged harassment outside British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinics have stopped almost completely. So when she heard JD Vance, the US vice-president, decrying buffer zone laws as an attack on the “liberties of religious Britons” in a speech on Friday at the Munich Security Conference – and condemning the conviction of a man, Adam Smith-Connor, who he said had been targeted for “just silently praying on his own” – she wasn’t impressed. “You can’t see these things in isolation,” she says. Rather than being a one-off, Clarke sees the Smith-Connor case as part of a wider effort by anti-abortion campaigners to test the new law to the limits – and shift the focus away from the true reason for buffer zones to a debate about freedom of speech. Hers is a view shared by reproductive healthcare professionals, legal experts and campaigners who believe buffer zones – intended to protect service users and staff – are being targeted in an orchestrated campaign by conservative Christian groups that are fuelling the spread of misinformation and seeking to shift the terms of the debate. At the centre of the efforts is the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a prominent conservative Christian group which opposes gay marriage as well as wanting abortion to be banned – and has been labelled an extreme rightwing “hate group” by critics including the Southern Poverty Law Center in the US. The Observer has found that the group’s UK branch has coordinated publicity and funded legal costs in a string of cases of alleged abortion buffer zone breaches. In that of Smith-Connor, who was convicted in October, it has written blog posts, launched a fundraising campaign and is paying for a legal appeal. Using almost identical language to that used by Vance, it has circulated statements claiming Smith-Connor is the victim of a “thought crime”. In reality, he had been prosecuted for breaching a public space protection order which had been put in place to protect staff and service users following issues with protests. The new buffer zone law that Vance referred to, which has since come into force, makes it illegal under the Public Order Act 2023 for anyone to do anything that intentionally or recklessly influences someone’s decision to use abortion services, obstructs them, or causes harassment or distress, within 150 metres of a clinic. The law doesn’t explicitly mention prayer, or silent prayer, but criminalises behaviour likely to intimidate staff or service users. At the time of his arrest in November 2022, Smith-Connor had been partially standing behind a tree near an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, which was protected by a public space protection order following anti-abortion activity. He had been praying, which he said was because he and his former girlfriend had once aborted a pregnancy. But he had also been asked repeatedly to move on, by a community officer who had spoken to him for an hour and 40 minutes. Ordering him to pay £9,000 costs, district judge Orla Austin said he had breached a public space protection order and that his actions had been “deliberate”. After Vance’s comments on Friday, the ADF celebrated online. CEO and president Kristen Waggoner – who was in Europe this week in a visit that coincided with Vance’s – posted on X: “Very grateful to Vice President @JDVance for highlighting Adam’s unjust and illiberal conviction for silent prayer in the UK.” The ADF is also funding legal help for Isabel Vaughan-Spruce, the founder of the March for Life anti-abortion group, who has been arrested twice, but not convicted over alleged buffer zone violations, and was paid £13,000 by West Midlands police. A prosecutor had said the case had not met the full code test, which assesses whether prosecutions are in the public interest and if there is sufficient evidence. A West Midlands spokesperson said Vaughan-Spruce had made a civil claim for unlawful arrest, assault and a breach of human rights and it had settled the claim without any admission of liability. This weekend, the ADF was sharing videos of Vaughan-Spruce outside an abortion clinic, being asked to move on by an officer and declining. The ADF also backed Father Sean Gough, a Catholic priest who faced charges claiming he intimidated service users near an abortion clinic, which were later dropped for the same reason as Vaughan-Spruce’s - and is supporting a fourth woman who is expected to appear in court next month over her alleged failure to pay a fixed penalty notice after she was accused of breaching a buffer zone. The cases raise questions about the growing influence of US anti-abortion groups in Britain. The Observer previously reported that the UK branch of the ADF had more than doubled its spending since 2020 and been appointed a stakeholder in a parliamentary group on religious freedoms in a role that grants it direct access to MPs. In all the cases, at the centre of the ADF’s publicity is the idea that silent prayer is being criminalised – and people’s right to freedom of religion is being eroded. But Clarke says this is a distraction. “The thing they try to push is that it’s just ‘silently praying’: you might be walking down the road minding your business and a police officer leaps out. But that’s not how it works. These campaigners seek out abortion clinics and they stand directly outside,” she says. Pam Lowe, senior sociology lecturer at Aston University, who has researched the anti-abortion movement, said: “From my research the intimidation comes from people standing there. Most people are not immersed in what is or isn’t happening outside abortion clinics. So all they see is someone they think is going to stop them. It doesn’t matter what that person intends or doesn’t intend to do, it’s the presence rather than the action that’s the problem. I’ve seen people climb over walls, put their hood up or try to run past these people, because they don’t know and have no idea what their intentions are.” She said the attempt to focus on “silent prayer” and freedom of speech and religion appeared to be a “deliberate strategy by the anti-abortion movement”. “They are still free to pray and say what they want about abortion. They are just asking them to move 100m down the street.” The ADF says it wants buffer zones to be abolished altogether. Lois McLatchie Miller, the ADF’s UK spokesperson, said they did “not exist to protect women from harassment (as this, rightfully, was already illegal). Rather, they violate fundamental freedoms by criminalising people for peaceful, consensual conversations, and even prayers”. The group says it’s proud to back the legal defences of Smith–Connor, Vaughan-Spruce and others it says have been “targeted for their Christian faith”. It denies it is a hate group – a claim it says is part of a “smear campaign” – and says Smith-Connor’s prosecution is “one of the most extreme examples of censorship in a free society”. “The UK is on show to the world for “thought policing,” which is incompatible with democracy,” Miller said. But from a legal standpoint, academics say the current law is robust – and strikes the delicate balance between the rights of campaigners, and the rights of the people it is intended to protect. Prof George Letsas, from the faculty of law at UCL, said the buffer zones law – which came into effect in England and Wales in October - was already “very clear” – and effectively balanced the human rights of all parties. “From a legal perspective it’s clear that the right of women to access abortion services prevails over the right to protest, including silent protest,” he said. He feels efforts by campaign groups to influence UK legal processes are “very problematic”. “Because where the money spent is very substantial, and there are deep pockets, you worry about the outcomes and being one-sided. What’s better is if these cases come to the courts more organically as opposed to in an orchestrated way where they’re trying to test the limits of the law. The problem is these appear to be orchestrated, deliberate efforts.” Emily Ottley, lecturer in the law department at the University of Winchester, said challenges to arrests and convictions were to be expected, given the buffer zones law is new and has not been tested. “It’s important to not completely eradicate the views and feelings of the people who are protesting,” she said. But she said the law had been formulated in a way that balanced the human rights of both parties - adding that the true test would be in how it was treated by police, prosecutors and the courts in months to come. For Dr Jonathan Lord, the medical director at MSI Reproductive Choices and co-chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists abortion taskforce, the ADF funding of legal cases shows how “the radical American right wing” had been “empowered” and was attempting to push its “extreme anti-abortion views in the UK and around the world”. He said he hoped the focus of the conversation would return to the true reason why the law was brought in. “For the terrified woman who knows she faces abuse if their partner discovers she is pregnant, it is irrelevant whether the protester is praying, thinking about their shopping list or has an empty mind. It is simply that they are there that is the problem,” he said. “It has nothing to do with freedom of speech or of banning prayer, but of preventing harm to women, girls and their families.” • This article was amended on 16 February 2025. Adam Smith-Connor was prosecuted for breaching a public space protection order, not “under the Public Order Act 2023”, which has since come into force, as an earlier version said. Comments by Emily Ottley regarding the buffer zones law were also clarified.","2025-02-16T06:00:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/16/prayer-and-prosecutions-the-us-hate-group-waging-war-over-britains-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones"
"abortion","Étienne-Émile Baulieu obituary","The French doctor and biochemist, Étienne-Émile Baulieu, who has died aged 98, was known as the “father of the abortion pill” for the development of RU486 (mifepristone) in 1980. It blocks the uptake of progesterone, which is essential for a successful pregnancy and, taken with a second drug (misoprostol), triggers a miscarriage. “Medical abortion”, as taking the two pills is known, is faster and more convenient than surgical procedures, and in 2022 accounted for 86% of terminations in the UK. Baulieu told the German newspaper Die Zeit that when he was in Calcutta in the early 1970s, he was approached by a young woman begging. She had two very young children in tow and cradled a baby in her arms. He could see the baby had died. He told Die Zeit that the moment was pivotal: “The fatalism of extreme poverty and pregnancies! At that moment, I decided to stand up for women to make sure they could make their own decisions about their bodies. It gave meaning to my life as a doctor and researcher.” At this time, Baulieu, who had made key discoveries about the hormone DHEA, was director of a research unit at Inserm (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and professor of biochemistry at the Bicêtre faculty of medicine at the University of Paris-Sud. Creating a pill to stop pregnancy had been on his mind for a long time. In 1961 he had discussed with Gregory Pincus, the US inventor of the contraceptive pill, that if a chemical could be found to block the uptake of progesterone in the uterus, it would be impossible for a fertilised egg to embed. Baulieu was able to research a suitable drug at Roussel Uclaf, a French pharmaceutical company that specialised in steroid hormones, where he was a consultant. It was a long road, but in 1980 he identified his antiprogesterone chemical, which the company called RU486 (RU from their initials and 486 because it was the 38,486th substance they had synthesised). A tortuous path followed to bring the drug to market. Roussel Uclaf underwent a lot of changes in the 70s and the German pharmaceutical giant Hoechst AG became its majority shareholder. Baulieu lobbied the Hoechst management hard to bring RU486 to market, but the chief executive, Wolfgang Hilger, was a devout Catholic and shrank from the adverse publicity it was attracting. As news of RU486 circulated, hostile articles in the press appeared and letters poured in to Roussel Uclaf. Some called it “a chemical coathanger” and Pope Jean-Paul II denounced it as “the pill of Cain” (referring to the Bible story in which Cain kills his brother Abel). There were demonstrations, and anti-abortionists bought shares in Roussel Uclaf, so that they could attend and disrupt shareholder meetings. Baulieu was likened to Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor who had conducted hideous experiments in concentration camps. He had to have a bodyguard at public meetings, and at a New Orleans conference he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, when his talk was rescheduled at the last minute. The bomb intended for him injured another hapless speaker. Roussel Uclaf dithered during the 80s, submitting but then retracting its application to the French ethics committee to have RU486 licensed for use. In September 1988 the drug was finally approved by the French authorities, but under pressure from anti-abortionists a month later Roussel Uclaf said that it would stop marketing it. At the time, Baulieu was at the World Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Incensed, he organised a petition that thousands of doctors at the conference signed, insisting it should be made available to women. The row made newspaper headlines all over the world, and the French health minister Claude Évin intervened, saying in a TV interview that sales of RU486 must resume as the government had approved the drug and it was the “moral property of all women”. Roussel Uclaf complied and slowly RU486 was licensed in other countries, for example the UK (1991) and Sweden (1992). Baulieu soldiered on, lobbying for it to be licensed elsewhere, including in the US. He stressed it was safer than anything else, telling the New York Times in 1989, “Almost 50 million women have abortions each year, and some 150,000 women die annually from botched abortions. RU486 could save the lives of thousands of women.” Baulieu was born Étienne Blum in Strasbourg to Léon Blum, a nephrologist, and Thérèse (nee Lion), a lawyer. His father died when he was three and his mother took him and his two sisters, Simone and Françoise, to live first in Paris and then in Grenoble, where he attended the lycée Champollion. The second world war was well under way and France was occupied by the Nazis. Aged 15, Baulieu and his classmates were committing acts of defiance such as throwing stones at people who worked for the Germans and distributing anti-Nazi leaflets. One day he spied a couple of men outside a cafe where he was sitting whom he reckoned might be Germans tailing him. Slipping out through a window at the back, he left Grenoble without a word to his family, and met up with undercover French Resistance members in Chambéry in south-east France. False papers were a must, and he changed his name from Étienne Blum to Émile Baulieu (making himself a year older at the same time, so that he could buy cigarettes). His group mostly ferried weapons, but in 1944 they kidnapped Charles Marion, a prominent officer in the Vichy regime, and executed him. As the youngest, Baulieu was excused from shooting the prisoner, but he was tasked instead with taking photographs of the event. At the end of the war, Baulieu was reunited with his family and studied medicine and biochemistry at the Université Paris Cité, qualifying in 1955. He had wanted to enrol at medical school under his true name but, as his ID card had “Émile Baulieu”, he had to be enrolled as such, and the name stuck. He preferred to be called Étienne-Émile Baulieu. Aged 20 in 1947, Baulieu married Yolande Compagnon and had three children: Catherine, Laurent and Frédérique. They remained married until Yolande died in 2015, but for decades lived separate lives. In the 60s Baulieu socialised with artists such as Andy Warhol and Frank Stella, and had affairs with the film star Sophia Loren and the artist Niki de Saint Phalle. In the 90s he met his long-term partner, Simone Harari, a TV executive, and they married in 2016. In the late 90s Baulieu retired from Inserm and his university posts, but continued to teach and conduct research for the rest of his life. He was a professor emeritus at the Collège de France and he set up the Institut Baulieu in 2008 as a vehicle for his new research interest: to understand neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Tau proteins are thought to interfere with brain cell communication; into his 90s Baulieu was working on a way to target them with another naturally occurring protein that he had identified. In 2003-04 he chaired the French Academy of Sciences and in 1989 won the prestigious Albert Lasker prize. In 2023 President Macron awarded him France’s highest honour: the grand cross of the Légion d’Honneur. Baulieu is survived by his wife, his three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. • Étienne-Émile Baulieu (Étienne Blum), doctor and biochemist, born 12 December 1926; died 30 May 2025","2025-06-23T16:40:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jun/23/etienne-emile-baulieu-obituary"
"abortion","‘Slippery slope’ fears over assisted dying have echoes of abortion debate","“It is entirely possible that future generations will puzzle over how such a fundamental right could ever be denied to them.” These are the words of David Steel, the veteran former leader of the Liberal party and a Westminster MP for more than three decades, referring to this Friday’s historic vote in parliament on whether to legalise assisted dying. But Steel could just as well have been referring to a private member’s bill he brought before parliament 57 years ago that was also about the right to bodily autonomy and was the subject of fierce debate and vocal opposition from church leaders. That bill – passed under a free vote by MPs – became the 1967 Abortion Act, the “landmark legislation that underpins women’s and girls’ right to safe abortion services nearly six decades on”, Steel wrote in the Sunday Times. One of the arguments deployed by opponents of the abortion act was that it would result in a “slippery slope” – that its strict criteria would inevitably be widened to allow “abortion on demand” up to a pregnancy’s full term. A similar argument is being used by opponents of assisted dying. But the fears raised more than half a century ago in relation to abortion have not been realised. Under the original terms of the Abortion Act, a woman could terminate a pregnancy at less than 28 weeks’ gestation under certain conditions, including harm to her physical or mental health or the foetus’s health. Abortion was allowed beyond 28 weeks in very limited circumstances, such as if the woman’s life was at risk. Since then, the law has been changed twice but the criteria for an abortion have remained the same. The act was tightened in 1990 to lower the gestation limit for abortions from 28 weeks to 24 weeks, the point at which a foetus was considered viable outside the uterus. The law was further changed in 2022 to permit women in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy to take medication at home to terminate a pregnancy. This confirmed in law a temporary approval issued during the Covid pandemic, when access to clinics was limited. Despite the furore at the time around the legalisation of abortion, it is widely accepted today that women should have the right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy. Nearly nine in 10 people surveyed by YouGov last year agreed that abortion should be allowed, with 49% saying the current 24-week limit was about right. Two-thirds of people said abortion should be available to any woman who wants it up to 24 weeks. In 2022 there were 251,377 abortions, the highest number since the Abortion Act was introduced. The high numbers – of great concern to those opposed to abortion – are an illustration of how the law has been utilised. As Steel pointed out, there are other areas of the social-legal landscape that are almost unrecognisable from that of the middle of the last century. “For a young person reaching adulthood today, the idea that the state could wield its power to prohibit them from marrying the person they love, dissolving a marriage when love is absent, or choosing when and whether to have children would be viewed as not just alien but irrational,” he wrote. Those putting forward the “slippery slope” argument on assisted dying often point to other countries – principally Canada – that have legalised it. Canada’s medical assistance in dying (Maid) laws, crafted in response to a supreme court decision, initially covered only terminally ill Canadians. However, in 2019 a judge ruled that restricting access to those who had a “reasonably foreseeable death” was unconstitutional, forcing federal lawmakers to expand the law. Now, a person must have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” to be eligible. They must meet all the criteria of having a serious illness, disease or disability; being in an advanced state of decline that cannot be reversed; and experiencing unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be relieved. The Canadian government has shelved an expansion of the law to include people with mental illnesses. The US state of Oregon, which legalised assisted dying in 1997 and whose law has been used as a model for many other jurisdictions, has not changed its criteria for eligibility in the past 27 years. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who has put forward the assisted dying bill to the Westminster parliament, has said there is a misconception that the scope of the law has been broadened in other countries. Of her bill, she said this weekend: “The strict eligibility criteria make it very clear that we are only talking about people who are already dying. That is why the bill is called the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill; its scope cannot be changed and clearly does not include any other group of people.”","2024-11-24T18:00:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/slippery-slope-fears-over-assisted-dying-echoes-of-abortion-debate"
"abortion","Idaho abortion trial to hear from women denied medically necessary abortions","Women denied medically necessary abortions in Idaho are expected to testify this week in a trial over the state’s near-total abortion ban. The trial, which starts on Tuesday and is expected to last through at least Thursday, is part of a lawsuit filed by abortion rights supporters who want to clarify the medical exceptions in Idaho’s near-total abortion ban. Currently, abortions are only permitted in Idaho to preserve a patient’s health. The vagueness of the exception means women have been forced to go out of state for the procedure, or wait until they get sick enough that doctors can legally intervene. “This has got to be better. This just cannot continue to happen to people,” Jen Adkins, the lead plaintiff in the case, recently told the Guardian. Adkins was denied an abortion in Idaho after learning that she was likely to miscarry and that continuing her pregnancy could endanger her health. “I want people to know how these bans affect real people in real life, because I guarantee you that everybody has somebody in their life that this similar type of thing has happened to. And if they don’t know somebody, it’s just because that person does not feel safe enough to share.” In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, paving the way for 18 states to ban almost all abortions, dozens of women have come forward to say that they were denied medically necessary abortions. At least four women — Amber Nicole Thurman, Candi Miller, Jossica Barnica and Nevaeh Crain — have reportedly died because they were unable to access legal abortions or because bans delayed their care. Similar lawsuits, filed in Texas and Tennessee, have also asked the states to clarify the scope of the medical exceptions in their near-total abortion bans. In Texas, the state supreme court in May 2024 rejected the lawsuit and let the state’s ban stand as is. “The overarching theme of all of these cases is that exceptions do not work, and we’re seeing this time and time again,” said Gail Deady, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the women in the Texas, Tennessee and Idaho cases. In the wake of Roe’s demise, Idaho has become a kind of cautionary tale about the consequences of banning abortions. Many doctors have fled the state, which already had rising rates of maternal and infant mortality, or stopped practicing rather than risk facing criminal consequences due to the state’s abortion ban. Originally, the ban only allowed abortions to save patients’ lives. However, the Biden administration sued Idaho over that narrow exception, arguing that it violated a federal law known as Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or Emtala, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients in medical emergencies. The case went all the way to the US supreme court, which ultimately punted on the case. But the justices restored a court order that temporarily permits providers to perform abortions to protect patients’ health – a slightly lower threshold for medical intervention – while the case winds through the lower courts. The other plaintiffs in the Idaho case include Jillaine St.Michel, who fled Idaho for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with severe genetic and developmental conditions that would have required palliative care immediately after birth. Adkins and St.Michel are both expected to testify, as are plaintiffs Kayla Smith and Rebecca Vincen-Brown, two other women who were denied abortions. Two doctors and the Idaho Academy of Family Physicians have also joined the case. The last few weeks have been rocky for abortion rights supporters. Although seven states passed ballot measures to protect abortion rights on election day, measures failed in three other states. Donald Trump’s impending return to the White House may also lead to additional restrictions. Of particular concern to advocates is the possibility that his administration could invoke a 19th-century anti-vice law to effectively ban all abortions nationwide.","2024-11-12T11:00:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/idaho-abortion-trial"
"abortion","California prepares to fortify state’s abortion access: ‘Fight for what’s right’","As Donald Trump returns to the White House, anti-abortion groups are hoping this is their moment. With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the US supreme court governed by a conservative supermajority, activists are pushing an extreme agenda, including a nationwide abortion ban, a prohibition on abortion pills, a “fetal personhood” doctrine that could restrict in vitro fertilization and attacks on contraception. Rights groups are looking to states to safeguard reproductive care, perhaps none more so than California, the most populous and among the bluest in the US. California lawmakers are already preparing. Mia Bonta, a Democratic assemblymember, who chairs the state assembly’s health committee, said she will be introducing a package of bills next month that seeks to expand access to birth control pills, protect emergency abortion care at hospitals and enhance maternal health in the state. “When the federal government and president is moving to a motto of ‘your body, my choice,’ I think it’s very important we clarify in the state of California what our bottom line is,” Bonta said in an interview on Tuesday. “California will continue to be a sanctuary state, to push for the recognition of women’s autonomy and our bodily autonomy and to prioritize through our healthcare policy, access to full reproductive care.” Bonta will put her bills forward on 2 December, the start of the “Trump-proofing” emergency legislative session called by the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. Since 2022, abortion rights are enshrined in California’s constitution and the state in recent years has established itself as a sanctuary for women from other states seeking the procedure. Bonta’s proposals seek to further that trend, she said. Since the supreme court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in its 2022 Dobbs decision, states have been free to set policy, with 21 banning or restricting the procedure. Californians in 2022 passed a measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. A first bill is meant to ensure access to emergency reproductive healthcare. It’s a response to a law passed last year in Idaho, which established that abortions in the state are only allowed when the life of the patient is in danger. Advocates fear that under Trump, Idaho’s interpretation could be expanded nationwide, threatening abortion care in emergencies. “We wanted to ensure that in California you do not have to go through a heartbreak and health emergency … should you need access to abortion in emergency rooms,” Bonta said. Her second bill aims to increase access to over-the-counter birth control for recipients of Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. Her third bill seeks to streamline the licensing process for alternative birthing centers, as the number of labor and delivery wards in some parts of the state has dwindled in recent years. In some regions, Bonta said, women in labor could have to travel up to two hours to get care: “I’m just blown away that in the United States, in this day and age, that that is the case.”. Birthing centers are linked to better health outcomes for lower-income women, the lawmaker noted, adding she was looking for ways to make the centers more financially sustainable. While Trump on the campaign trail has said legislation should be left to states and that he would veto a national ban, he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue. And there are many other ways his administration could unravel rights and access, even in blue states. Project 2025, the rightwing manifesto crafted by his allies, calls for the president to roll back the FDA approval of abortion pills, increase CDC “surveillance” of pregnancy loss and erode federal funding for family planning programs that provide contraception. Bonta said it was important to recognize that access to abortion is a right supported by a majority of voters, including many in states that voted for Trump. Missouri, Montana, Arizona and Nevada all favored Trump and passed abortion rights measures this month. Safeguarding Californians’ access to abortion is personal for Bonta. In 2022, she revealed she had an abortion at the age of 21. “I chose to own my body,” she said at the time. It’s a decision that helped her break the “cycle of poverty in my family”, she said. “It was important to me to be very open about my own health journey,” she said this week. “In this moment when women in other parts of the country are having to go back to considering engaging in a practice that will put their lives at risk, it’s important to be a beacon … and fight to make sure [they] have the same kind of care that I was afforded. I want to be able to look my daughters in the eye and tell them I’m fighting for their health, their quality of life and that of their children.” Bonta is married to California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who is readying the state’s department of justice to fight a range of possible Trump administration efforts that would restrict civil rights and impede other progressive initiatives in the state. The attorney general has said he is prepared to take on those policies with litigation and has draft legal briefs ready, including to challenge a national abortion ban. Trump is expected to push back hard. Bonta said she hoped legislators wouldn’t be distracted by culture war rhetoric, and would focus on “sound policy that can stand up against federal intervention”. While the conservative leanings of the courts have made that challenge more difficult, she said, “our job is to fight for what’s right and and hope the court system … will not try to legislate through legal rulings and that there will be some modicum of decency in the judiciary.” “It’s hard not to feel like we’re heading into a dystopian state,” said Bonta. “There are a lot of people who are just as scared as I am in this moment … As a legislator, I have the privilege of being in the halls of power in the state of California. I’m thankful I have the ability to fight.”","2024-11-22T13:00:13Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/22/trump-california-abortion"
"abortion","‘A kitchen film with no food porn’: how Alonso Ruizpalacios sold Rooney Mara on his abortion drama","Anyone who visited the Rainforest Cafe, a now defunct Piccadilly Circus tourist trap serving overpriced burgers among plastic foliage and animatronic wildlife, may have met a future auteur without realising it. In the early 00s, Alonso Ruizpalacios was not the gifted, ingenious director he is today – the man behind A Cop Movie, a slippery psychodrama that breaks the laws of documentary, and the new La Cocina, starring Rooney Mara as a waitress at a hectic New York restaurant. Back then, he wore baggy khaki shorts and welcomed customers to the Rainforest Cafe. “Hi, I’m Alonso and I’ll be your safari guide today,” he would say. “You guys been here before? No? Well, this is Bamba, our gorilla. Occasionally there will be rain showers, but – hey – don’t be afraid, you won’t get wet!” Sitting in a London hotel room with a view of the Thames, the film-maker grimaces at the memory. “You had to give the whole spiel,” he says. “It was fucking horrible.” Ruizpalacios, who was raised in a suburb of Mexico City by parents who are both doctors, is 47, with dense stubble, curly black hair and chunky-framed Harry Palmer-style glasses. Give or take the same lopsided smile, he doesn’t look much like the budding matinee idol in his Rada headshot. “I got into acting because I wanted to be a director,” he says. “And I needed to understand actors.” They’re all nuts, right? “They’re strange creatures for sure,” he replies diplomatically. “Frail, vain, brave. Full of contradictions. I could say many things. I don’t want to say the wrong thing.” After all, he is married to one: Ilse Salas, who starred in his 2014 debut, Güeros, a road movie that goes stylishly in circles, and Museo, with Gael García Bernal as one of the perpetrators of a real-life museum heist. While studying at Rada, Ruizpalacios did crummy jobs to earn his keep, which is where the Rainforest Cafe came in. He can draw a direct line between that experience and La Cocina. For starters, the film is adapted from Arnold Wesker’s 1957 play The Kitchen, which he first read while at Rada. “Wesker’s play made the restaurant seem tolerable. But during my first few weeks in the job, I would have nightmares every night, imagining I was still at work and the orders were running late.” Directors and chefs aren’t so dissimilar, and he concedes that there is a “militarised” hierarchy to film sets and kitchens alike. “But I’m no Gordon Ramsay.” La Cocina is a lively, relentless portrait of American working life, set during one day below stairs at The Grill, with its staff of immigrants, many of them undocumented, from the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Morocco. Among them is the sous chef Pedro (the director’s regular collaborator Raúl Briones), who is in love with Julia, played by Mara. Isn’t there a risk of imbalance when a performer like Mara joins a cast of less feted or recognisable actors? “There is,” he admits, “but I wanted a Hollywood star because that’s how Julia is in Pedro’s mind. Though she’s actually very grounded.” What about Mara herself? Don’t A-listers come with entourages, even their own chefs to rival the fictional ones of La Cocina? “We kept all that to a minimum,” he says with a knowing smile. “We weren’t a big production; we shot all the interiors in Mexico. And Rooney is very grounded, just like Julia. As one of my teachers at Rada used to say: ‘Nobody shits jam.’” La Cocina is shot in a dreamy monochrome, which calls to mind Coppola’s Rumble Fish. As do the film’s absurdist touches: an unseen rat tugging a pizza along the street, or a malfunctioning soda machine that floods the submarine-like kitchen with Cherry Coke as if in some sugary spin on Das Boot. Ruizpalacios chose black-and-white to help render the film timeless. “You don’t know when it’s taking place. That’s why there are no mobile phones. I wanted something beyond realism.” But that approach was also one of several sticking points for potential financiers. “Black-and-white was a big no for everyone we went to.” Even after the success of Roma, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. “Roma is an anomaly, I think, because Cuarón is such a big name. People were also put off because I insisted on Raúl in the lead role instead of a star. And this is a kitchen film with no food porn. And half of it is in Spanish.” Don’t forget it also has one character contemplating an abortion. “A studio we went to said: ‘Can we not have the abortion storyline?’ I was, like: ‘That’s one of the main parts!’ It’s insane that we’re still talking about a woman’s right to choose.” Surely the popularity of other frantic kitchen-based dramas such as The Bear and Boiling Point must have assuaged backers’ concerns. “We were already in pre-production when The Bear came out. I still haven’t seen it: I didn’t want it to influence what we were doing.” Had La Cocina been shot in colour, minus the abortion storyline, and with, say, Jacob Elordi as Pedro, there would still be no expunging the text’s inherent anti-capitalist bent. “It’s about how the capitalist machine leaves no room for dreams,” says Ruizpalacios, alluding to the central sequence in which the kitchen staff are overwhelmed by orders during the lunchtime rush. “At the beginning, they’re talking about other things, little inner conflicts. As it progresses, there’s no room for the personal, and it’s all orders, orders, orders. It shows how relationships are obliterated by the rhythm of capitalism and work, and the pressure to keep the production line going. That was one of the scenes that kept me thinking about the play all these years. But the feedback we got was opposed to this kind of film, which criticises the American working ethos, and the way migrants are treated. That makes it an uncomfortable watch.” If the situation was bad when Ruizpalacios and I met last year, a month before the US election, it has grown immeasurably graver since then. The director has been busy finishing a new script: his adaptation of Juan José Saer’s western The Clouds, about psychiatric patients being led across the desert to a new hospital, which he has transposed to the late 1840s and the Mexican-American war. Since we met, he has also been asked a hundred times for his views on Emilia Pérez, the Oscar-winning musical criticised for exploiting and trivialising the horror of the drug wars in his country. Make that a hundred and one times. “I understand why people in Mexico were offended,” he says now when we catch up by phone. “But I just thought the film was weak. I believe anyone should be able to put themselves in another person’s shoes. But if you’re going to do that, you should be thorough and penetrating with your research. I don’t think Emilia Pérez ever transcends its colonialist view.” There are even bigger problems afoot. La Cocina represents a list of Donald Trump and JD Vance’s pet hates: undocumented immigrants, abortion, anti-capitalism. How does it feel to be releasing the film into such a hostile world? “I think it only makes it more urgent and poignant,” he says. Would it be harder, perhaps even impossible, to finance today? “Oh, definitely. We already made it in an unwelcoming time for stories that were critical of the establishment. I see a lot of caution ahead in the US. I see peers who are careful about what they say, what they put out. As a foreigner, it’s different because I have no skin in that game.” Presumably he still wants to work in the US, though: he recently directed three episodes of the Star Wars spin-off series Andor. “Yeah, but working in Mexico, too, gives you a different perspective. There’s a whole life beyond Hollywood.” I think back to my final question to him last year, when I asked about the pressure to bring home a best director Oscar like his compatriots Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu (who have two each) and Guillermo del Toro. “I reject that pressure,” he told me then. “That isn’t the end of the rainbow for me. Oscars don’t matter. Most people can’t even remember what won last year. I can’t. Can you?” Then we sat in silence for a few moments, racking our brains. The sun twinkled on the Thames. Point taken. • La Cocina is in cinemas from 28 March","2025-03-24T11:56:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/24/a-kitchen-film-with-no-food-porn-how-alonso-ruizpalacios-sold-rooney-mara-on-his-abortion-drama"
"abortion","Location tracking, meet abortion bans – authoritarians have too much power","The abortion surveillance state Ever heard of Babel Street? Unless you’re a data and analytics enthusiast, it’s likely you haven’t. The Virginia-based technology company isn’t a household name the way that Google and Facebook are. And yet the company most likely knows a hell of a lot about you and everyone else in your household. Babel Street, you see, has a people-tracking service called Locate X, that allows customers to track individual mobile users by their Mobile Advertising ID: a string of characters that uniquely identifies your phone or other smart device. Where it gets really creepy is that, according to recent reporting from Krebs on Security and other outlets, Babel Street allows its customers, which include government agencies, to “draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area”. What does this mean? Well, among many other disturbing things, it means that you could use Locate X to zoom in on an abortion clinic and see exactly who is going in and out of it. In fact, this is exactly what a group of privacy advocates recently did. They looked at an abortion clinic in Florida and tracked one individual leaving it. Then they leaked a video of the demonstration to media outlets including 404 Media. “This phone started at a residence in Alabama in mid-June,” 404 Media says in a description of the demonstration. “It then went by a Lowe’s Home Improvement store, traveled along a highway, went past a gas station, visited a church, crossed over into Florida, and then stopped at the abortion clinic for approximately two hours.” It wasn’t immediately obvious who the individual being tracked was. However, 404 Media notes that “it would be trivial for US authorities, some of which already have access to this tool, to go one step further and unmask this or other abortion clinic visitors”. Locate X’s location-tracking capabilities aren’t new news: the service has popped up in various headlines over the years. In 2020, for example, it was reported that the US Secret Service (USSS) had signed a contract to use Locate X. And last year Guardian reported that Australia’s Home Affairs had had access to Locate X since at least 2021. While details of Locate X’s capabilities aren’t entirely new, what is new is the political and legal climate in which the platform operates. A number of states, including Alabama (which has effectively banned abortion), are trying to criminalize anyone who helps a woman leave the state to get an abortion elsewhere. The terms of service for Locate X state the product “may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action”, but you can very easily see how the technology could be misused. “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,” Jeff Hammerbacher, one of Facebook’s first employees, lamented back in 2011. “That sucks.” It certainly does. But what is far more depressing is the fact that the technology used to make people click on ads has grown into a vast, and largely unregulated, web of surveillance. All around the world, authoritarianism is on the rise. And thanks to technology originally designed to encourage you to buy more cereal, authoritarian leaders have never had so much power. Infant death rates in the US increased after Roe was overturned A new study, published by JAMA Pediatrics, found hundreds more babies died than expected after Roe v Wade was overturned and more than a dozen states implemented near-total abortion bans. The increase was particularly pronounced among infants with congenital anomalies, the study notes: “[P]otentially owing to frail fetuses more often being carried to term following the implementation of abortion restrictions.” Judge strikes down Ohio abortion ban as unconstitutional Judge Christian Jenkins said last year’s voter-approved amendment “unequivocally protects the right to abortion”. Stevie Nicks thinks we should all get off the internet Rolling Stone has a very entertaining interview with Stevie Nicks. It’s full of gems but I particularly enjoyed this quote: “About 10 years ago, Katy Perry was talking to me about the internet armies of all the girl singers, and how cruel and rancid they were. I said, ‘Well, I wouldn’t know because I’m not on the internet.’ She said, ‘So, who are your rivals?’… I said, ‘Katy, I don’t have rivals. I have friends. All the other women singers that I know are friends. Nobody’s competing. Get off the internet and you won’t have rivals either.’” Evergreen advice. Texas pastor suggests executing ‘a few women’ to end false rape accusations Joel Webbon, a Texas pastor and Christian nationalist, has a history of misogynistic, racist and downright disturbing statements. As well as fantasizing about executing women he reckons God doesn’t want women to vote and has said he needs to approve every book his wife reads. Rather than being an isolated extremist, Webbon is part of a group of extremely online young Christian men that have been termed the TheoBros. “The TheoBros’ strategy is bottom-up: They aim to convert small American towns into Christian enclaves,” Kiera Butler recently wrote for Mother Jones. “But it is also top-down: Some are working to position themselves close to the locus of federal power.” Pregnancy is now a death sentence in Gaza “The targeting of maternity hospitals and the blockade that limits essential medical supplies, such as anaesthetics and maternity kits, from entering Gaza have turned pregnancy into a life-threatening condition for thousands of women,” a letter in the Lancet notes. Innocent babies in Gaza are being ‘born into hell’, as Unicef puts it, and deprived of any hope of a future. All with the help of our tax dollars. Did Jeff Bezos order the Washington Post not to endorse a candidate in the presidential race? The Washington Post editorial page has decided not to make a presidential endorsement for the first time in 36 years. According to NPR’s media correspondent, it is not clear whether Bezos, who owns the Post, or whether CEO Will Lewis made the call. However, there are rumours that “Bezos ordered the decision and Lewis carried it out”. Tucker Carlson is fantasizing about ‘daddy’ Donald Trump spanking teenage girls It’s even more gross than it sounds. The week in porktriarchy Thanks to the climate crisis and various other man-made issues, boars are invading the beach resorts of southern Spain and other areas with increasing frequency, the Guardian reports. (Although some may say they are not invading, they are conducting targeted ground operations.) This is causing all manner of problems, but is also providing some very memorable photos. None as great as this classic photo of a nudist bather who chased a wild boar near a Berlin lake after it stole his laptop. The nudist managed to recover it, by the way: in the end, all was swine.","2024-10-26T13:00:33Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/26/phone-location-tracking-abortion-surveillance-babel-street"
"abortion","A tale of two conferences: women against women as ‘poison of patriarchy’ returns and abortion fight intensifies","In a meeting room on the 27th floor of a swish Manhattan hotel, Denise Mountenay is telling the audience that the right to abortion is “Nazi thinking.” Mountenay regrets her own abortions, and says she has been called by God to spread the word that she and other women “were lied to, deceived, pressured into making the most horrible choice: to choose death instead of life”. She goes on to list reasons why abortion is “not a safe procedure. [That’s what] they want woman to think – that is a lie.” Many of her claims, including that abortion leads to breast cancer, have been thoroughly disproved by scientific studies. Other claims, such as that abortion causes lifelong mental health problems and infertility also have been shown to be untrue when access to abortion is safe and legal. Studies show that abortion denial increases the risk of both. Mountenay, from the Christian, anti-abortion Endeavour Forum, is one of many speakers, mostly women, to address the Conference on the State of Women and Family (CSWF) in New York. Over two days they speak repeatedly of love and respect for women, yet decry global efforts to empower women and expand their rights. They reiterate their stance against abortion in any circumstances, including gang-rape, and hail motherhood as the ultimate role for women. Sponsored by four leading US, rightwing organisations, including the Heritage Foundation – architect of Project 2025 – and C-Fam – designated a hate group by the The Southern Poverty Law Center – CSWF is an opportunity for conservative heavyweights and anti-abortion campaigners to reassert their opposition to “gender ideology” and air their grievances about the perceived attack on conservative values. LGBTQ rights, the pandemic treaty, comprehensive sex education and “leftish insanity” on US college campuses are held up as examples of corrupting secular ideologies. Trump’s blizzard of executive orders, including the assertion that “there are only two genders”, felt like “Christmas multiple days in a row,” says Jay W Richards, director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Centre for Life, and a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “Suddenly it’s a new day – that’s the good news; the bad news is the fight is not over.” *** Anti-rights actors are nothing new. But the ferociousness of the attack on – and scale of the current backlash against – women’s rights is sending a chill through rights defenders, giving an urgency to calls for a united response. A minute’s walk from the CSWF gathering, the 69th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is taking place at the same time at the UN’s headquarters. This annual meeting aims to address the widespread inequalities, violence and discrimination women continue to face around the world. UN secretary general António Guterres opens the conference with a red alert: “The poison of patriarchy is back – and it is back with a vengeance: slamming the brakes on action; tearing up progress; and mutating into new and dangerous forms.” His warning that hard-won gains are being thrown into reverse follows a UN report revealing that one in four countries reported a backlash on gender equality in 2024. Based on a review of progress by 159 member states, the report attributes the rollback to crises including a weakening of democratic institutions, Covid, climate breakdown and conflict. But it notes the key role of anti-rights actors who “are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues. Where they cannot roll back legal and policy gains altogether, they seek to block or slow their implementation.” Earlier this month, Oxfam published its own assessment of the damage being wreaked by anti-rights groups: “A range of rightwing, religious, and conservative actors around the world are capitalising on persistent crises, to reorient state power towards a reassertion of racist and sexist profit-driven systems that favours the wealthy, privileges men, and harms and disadvantages women and LGBTQIA+ people in the name of ‘traditional’ family values.” Many of the events taking place at UN event address the threat posed by anti-rights groups. In a session called Feminism for the Win: Strategies to Defy and Defeat Anti-feminist Movements, panellists speak of the rise of “chainsaw masculinity” and “rapid authoritarian transformation”. Marta Lempart, the activist who led Poland’s pro-choice women’s strikes, notes grimly “the alpha male is back in town,” adding: “The backlash is a pre-emptive strike in case feminists win, it’s a deliberate organised effort because we were so close.” The anti-rights movement is also present at the UN. In one Q&amp;A Liana Gordon, a youth delegate from the Canadian anti-abortion organisation Campaign Life Coalition, asks the panel: “You talk of women’s rights but what about the rights of the unborn child?” The question infuriates Lempart. “Whenever someone says ‘women’s rights but … or human rights but …’ it’s bullshit … I hate these guys and I’m saying that out loud. You have to fight, insult them, do all the things you should’t be doing. You have to speak how you feel.” It is a response that delights Gordon who later relays it to her fellow anti-abortion activists. “Last year I did not see this type of emotional response at least not at this level. It confirmed to me that we are winning,” says Gordon. “I have a message for Marta: you may hate me but we love you.” Challenging participants and taking up oxygen in discussions is a key strategy for anti-rights groups at CSW. After taking part in one panel discussion, Nelly Munyasia from the Reproductive Health Network Kenya, recalls being handed a flyer incorrectly stating that abortion is not legal in any country. “Initially I wasn’t scared, and then it hit me that this [anti-abortion] movement is more daring, bolder and is doing anything they can do to convey their message.” *** On the first day of CSW, member states adopt a political declaration reaffirming their commitment to respect, protect and champion the rights, equality, and empowerment of women and girls. Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women calls the declaration “a show of unity for all women and girls, everywhere … at a time when hard-fought gains for gender equality are under attack.” The US government refuses to endorse it, but it is welcomed by leading health and rights groups such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) as a sign of international solidarity and support for the human rights of women and girls. But the declaration has a glaring omission: while sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) was part of a draft declaration published in January, there is no mention in the final agreement. IPPF believes the absence of SRHR, a cornerstone of women’s equality and sustainable development, significantly weakens the text’s scope. Thirty years ago SRHR was included in the 12 critical areas covered by the historic Beijing declaration in 1995, a policy framework still regarded as the blueprint for gender equality and justice. Since then, it has often been a point of contention in international forums, but the 2024 agreement acknowledged “the need for ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including for family planning, information and education”. The omission this year is seen by global advocacy groups and research centres as another effect of the increasingly hostile environment. “This year negotiators didn’t feel they could continue to fight for [those rights] so they let it go – because [otherwise] it would crash the negotiations. Many of us find that profoundly disappointing,” says Beth Schlachter, senior director of US external relations at MSI Reproductive Choices. Schlachter’s colleague, Bethan Cobley, director of external affairs and partnerships, adds that the absence of language around SRHR has global ramifications, “These words set the global normative framework in the countries where we operate; countries take this language and use it to inform their national policies – it is hugely important.” The environment of extreme hostility is having numerous detrimental effects on healthcare providers attempting to deliver services to communities across Kenya, says Munyasia. “We come from a continent where abortion continues to be regarded as a taboo – you can imagine the work we have done to show women [they can have a safe abortion]. Now we are seeing disinformation which contributes to stigma and instils fear in women who will be termed murderers.” Munyasia has been harassed on social media and has had to remove signs from Reproductive Health Network Kenya offices, and even move offices; the call centre it runs has been reported to the authorities. The organisation has also recorded a rise in police targeting healthcare providers – it has documented 28 arrests of healthcare providers and their patients in the last two years. She is alarmed at the prospect of the Pan-African Conference on Family Values taking place in Nairobi in May adding to the atmosphere of fear and distrust among women who use reproductive healthcare services. The worst part of it, says Munyisia, is that relentless attacks combined with aid cuts will prevent women and girls accessing contraceptives and safe abortion leading to unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, a rise in HIV infections and maternal deaths. “It’s going to be messy unless we have funders that can step up to mitigate this,” she says. “What breaks my heart is that vulnerable women and girls will suffer in global south.” Back at CSWF, a delegate from Liberia asks a panel how she could support young women who have been gang-raped. “Pray,” comes the reply.","2025-03-22T05:00:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/22/women-rights-un-anti-abortion-choice-poison-of-patriarchy-returns"
"abortion","Doctors issue stark warning as Louisiana reclassifies abortion pills","Two common abortion pills are, as of Tuesday, classified as “controlled substances” in Louisiana, due to a first-of-its-kind law that medical professionals warn will endanger the lives of women by restricting medication used to treat postpartum hemorrhage and other conditions. Louisiana, which already bans abortion, passed a law reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as schedule IV drugs – a designation typically reserved for drugs that carry a risk of abuse or dependence. People caught with the drugs without a valid prescription could face up to five years in prison, although pregnant women who procure it for their own use are exempted from punishment under the law. Although the drugs are typically used in US medication abortions, they are also regularly used in an array of other circumstances, such as to help with miscarriage management, treat ulcers and soften the cervix during labor and other procedures. Normally, at the Louisiana hospital where OB-GYN Dr Nicole Freehill works, misoprostol is kept in so-called hemorrhage carts, which can be easily wheeled into the rooms where patients deliver babies and which carry medications normally used to treat hemorrhaging, including misoprostol. It takes about 15 seconds to pull the misoprostol out of the cart, Freehill said. Now, due to the security requirements placed on schedule IV drugs, the hospital must keep misoprostol stocked outside of patients’ rooms. When the hospital ran a drill to see how long it took nurses to grab the misoprostol under the new rules, it took nurses two minutes, Freehill said. “A lot of people might go: ‘Oh, two minutes, that’s really fast.’ And yes, in the long scheme of things, that’s fast. But when you have someone who is actively hemorrhaging – in two minutes, they can lose hundreds of cc’s of blood,” Freehill said. “So those seconds count. I’m definitely worried about what’s going to happen to patients who are hemorrhaging.” Compared to other wealthy nations, the United States already has a far higher maternal mortality rate, particularly among Black Americans. Before the law’s passage, more than 200 doctors wrote a letter to the state legislator behind the law, asking him to reconsider it. “Controlled substances require more complex coordination by pharmacists, patients and providers, with increased documentation and often longer waits for patients,” they wrote. “Overall, this results in fear and confusion among patients, doctors, and pharmacists, which delays care and worsens outcomes.” In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, more than a dozen states, including Louisiana, have banned almost all abortions. However, the number of abortions performed in US clinics rose, as did the number of self-induced abortions using pills. (Self-managed abortions are usually safe and effective in the first trimester of pregnancy.) In response, anti-abortion activists have tried to narrow access to abortion pills, which are used in two-thirds of all US abortions. However, there is no medical reason to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol as schedule IV drugs, Freehill said. “It could be five out of seven days of the week that I’m utilizing this medication, and obviously not for abortion care,” Freehill said. “I don’t see how this is going to help my patients be safer.”","2024-10-01T11:00:48Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/louisiana-abortion-pills"
"abortion","Melania Trump passionately defends abortion rights in upcoming memoir","Melania Trump made an extraordinary declaration in an eagerly awaited memoir to be published a month from election day: she is a passionate supporter of a woman’s right to control her own body – including the right to abortion. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” the Republican nominee’s wife writes, amid a campaign in which Donald Trump’s threats to women’s reproductive rights have played a central role. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Melania Trump has rarely expressed political views in public. Her book, Melania, which reveals the former first lady to be so firmly out of step with most of her own party, will be published in the US next Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy. Her decision to include a full-throated expression of support for abortion rights is remarkable not just given her proximity to a Republican candidate running on an anti-abortion platform, but also given the severe deterioration of women’s reproductive rights under Donald Trump and the GOP. In 2022, in the supreme court case Dobbs v Jackson, three justices installed when Donald Trump was president voted to strike down Roe v Wade, the ruling which had protected federal abortion rights since 1973. Republican-run states have since instituted draconian abortion bans. Donald Trump has tried to both take credit for the Dobbs decision – long the central aim of evangelical and conservative Catholic donors and voters – and avoid the fury it has stoked, saying abortion rights should be decided by the states. But Democrats have scored a succession of election wins by campaigning on the issue, even in conservative states, and threats to reproductive rights, among them threats to fertility treatments including IVF, are proving problematic for Republicans up and down this year’s ticket. Amid a blizzard of statements opponents deem misogynistic and regressive, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s pick for vice-president, has indicated he would support a national abortion ban – a move it seems his boss’s wife would be against. Donald Trump himself recently got into a tangle over whether he would vote in November to protect abortion rights in Florida, a ballot his wife will also cast given their residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. He eventually said he would vote no. Judging by her own words, Melania Trump appears likely to vote yes. Her memoir is slim, long on descriptions of her youth in Slovenia, life as a model in New York and love for the man whose third wife she became, correspondingly short on policy discussion. Donald Trump provides a blurb, praising his wife’s “commitment to excellence … insightful perspective … [and] entrepreneurial achievements”. Before discussing abortion, Melania Trump says she disagreed with her husband on some aspects of immigration policy, not least as an immigrant herself. “Occasional political disagreements between me and my husband,” she writes, are “part of our relationship, but I believed in addressing them privately rather than publicly challenging him.” And yet, later in her book, she states views on abortion and reproductive rights diametrically opposed to those of her husband and his party. “I have always believed it is critical for people to take care of themselves first,” Melania Trump writes. “It’s a very straightforward concept; in fact, we are all born with a set of fundamental rights, including the right to enjoy our lives. We are all entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence. “This common-sense approach applies to a woman’s natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.” Trump says her beliefs about abortion rights spring from “a core set of principles”, at the heart of which sit “individual liberty” and “personal freedom”, on which there is “no room for negotiation”. Detailing “legitimate reasons for a woman to choose to have an abortion”, she includes danger to the life of the mother, rape or incest, often exceptions under state bans, and also “a congenital birth defect, plus severe medical conditions”. Saying “timing matters”, Melania Trump also defends the right to abortion later in pregnancy. She writes: “It is important to note that historically, most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother. These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor. As a community, we should embrace these common-sense standards. Again, timing matters.” More than 90% of US abortions occur at or before 13 weeks of gestation, according to data from the CDC. Less than 1% of abortions take place at or after 21 weeks. On the campaign trail, Republicans have blatantly mischaracterized Democratic positions on abortion. Last month, debating Kamala Harris, Donald Trump falsely said his opponent’s “vice-presidential pick … says that abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. [Tim Walz] also says: ‘Execution after birth’ – execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born – is OK.” He was factchecked: it is not legal in any state to kill a baby after birth. In response to news of Melania Trump’s support for abortion rights, Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said in a statement: “Sadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives. “Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: if he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women’s access to reproductive health care.” The Trump campaign did not immediately comment. On social media, Melania Trump doubled down, posting a short video in which she paraphrased remarks in her book. On the page, Melania Trump issues a distinctly un-Trumpian appeal for empathy. “Many women opt for abortions due to personal medical concerns,” she writes. “These situations with significant moral implications weigh heavily on the woman and her family and deserve our empathy. Consider, for example, the complexity inherent in the decision of whether the mother should risk her own life to give birth.” Recent reporting has highlighted cases of women who have died in states where abortion has been banned. She goes on to appeal for compassion. “When confronted with an unexpected pregnancy, young women frequently experience feelings of isolation and significant stress. I, like most Americans, am in favor of the requirement that juveniles obtain parental consent before undergoing an abortion. I realize this may not always be possible. Our next generation must be provided with knowledge, security, safety, and solace, and the cultural stigma associated with abortion must be lifted,” writes the former first lady. Finally, Melania Trump offers an expression of solidarity with protesters for reproductive rights. “The slogan ‘My Body, My Choice’ is typically associated with women activists and those who align with the pro-choice side of the debate,” she writes. “But if you really think about it, ‘My Body, My Choice’ applies to both sides – a woman’s right to make an independent decision involving her own body, including the right to choose life. Personal freedom.”","2024-10-03T16:26:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/melania-trump-memoir-defends-abortion-rights"
"abortion","As funding dries up, private abortion clinics across the US are closing","Providing abortions rarely paid the bills for Kwajelyn Jackson in 2024. As the executive director of Feminist Women’s Health Center, an abortion clinic in Atlanta, Georgia, Jackson spent the year navigating Georgia’s six-week abortion ban, dwindling financial support for abortion patients and soaring inflation. The clinic spent more money than it brought in from providing abortions, especially as Jackson strove to pay her staffers a decent wage and the clinic often subsidized the abortions of patients who could not afford to pay. “Essentially, we are charging about half of what it costs to provide the care,” Jackson said. “Our ability to maintain payroll and our operating expenses on an ongoing basis was really strained for a portion of 2024. We were sort of living paycheck to paycheck.” Feminist Women’s Health Center is still open, but it’s one of the lucky ones. Over the last year, 11 independent abortion clinics closed, bringing the nationwide total of brick-and-mortar indie clinics in the US to 363, according to a report released on Tuesday morning by the Abortion Care Network (ACN), a network of independent providers. That’s down from more than 500 in 2012. In the US, “independent” abortion clinics are those not linked to a hospital or run by Planned Parenthood. Their closures can have an outsize impact on abortion access, since independent clinics provide almost 60% of all US abortions, according to the ACN report. More than 60% of the clinics that provide abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy are independently run, as are all of the clinics that perform abortions after 26 weeks. If the US network of independent clinics shrinks further, untold numbers of would-be abortion patients will probably be unable to end their pregnancies. “Whether it’s abortion bans or extremists outside of the clinic or the financial challenges that come along with having to shift services, move a clinic, comply with new regulations – clinics have been under an enormous amount of financial pressure,” said Jay Thibodeau, communications director for the Abortion Care Network. “The relief that they need is not coming right now.” In total, 76 independent abortion clinics have closed since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and permitted more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions.But the closures aren’t limited to states with restrictive laws. Of the 11 clinics that shuttered in the last year, eight were located in states with strong abortion protections. After Roe fell, millions of dollars in donations gushed into the coffers of abortion rights organizations. But in the years since, much of that money has dried up – especially funds going to independent clinics and abortion funds, which help patients pay for the procedure and logistical expenses that may surround it, such as travel and lodging. Meanwhile, patients’ needs have increased. Despite the clinic closures, US abortion rates have risen over the last two years, largely because people have traveled across state lines for the procedure or accessed abortion pills through tele-health. Medication abortions – which now account for roughly two-thirds of US abortions – require fewer resources to administer and can also be sent through the mail, alleviating the burden on brick-and-mortar clinics. Still, there is no real replacement for abortion clinics, which provide surgical abortions when medication is not an option, and other services like ultrasounds and counseling. “As a provider that provides both medication and procedural abortion, we know that people need multiple options,” Jackson said. “Medication abortion is not for everyone.” Over the summer, as donations slumped, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) announced that it was cutting the financial assistance it offered to abortion patients. Rather than covering 50% of the cost of an abortion in most states – and 100% in some states, including Georgia – NAF started covering only 30%. A few weeks later, an organization called Resources for Abortion Delivery ended The Access Fund (TAF), another program that helped pay for abortions, providing about $1m in funding each month, according to the Nation. A Resources for Abortion Delivery staffer declined the Guardian’s request for comment on why the organization ended the program. “As a policy, we do not provide comments to the press,” the staffer said in an email. For Feminist Women’s Health Center, these policy changes dramatically affected their work. “Our patients were basically getting free care,” Jackson said. “Now most patients are getting about 30% of the cost of their care covered by NAF funding and then other abortion funds are trying their best to fill in some more of that gap.” Economic forces have made things worse. In part because about half of abortion patients live below the federal poverty line, providers have kept the cost of abortions relatively low. But inflation has led the cost of everything else to surge. If Jackson were to charge patients the true cost of performing an abortion – including the cost of equipment and labor – she says she would probably have to double the clinic’s prices. Another source of strain is fatigue among would-be donors, more than two years after the fall of Roe. The Abortion Care Network has, for several years, run a fundraising campaign called Keep Our Clinics, which helps clinics pay for rent, security, legal costs and other services. In 2022, the campaign raised $5m. In 2023, it raised $3m. “We can’t sustain an entire system of healthcare on people donating a little bit at a time,” Thibodeau said. “We need enormous system change.”","2024-12-11T17:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/abortion-clinics-closing"
"abortion","David Crisafulli stares down LNP division on abortion and nuclear power","The Queensland premier, David Crisafulli, has told Liberal National party members the party “does not exist for culture wars” in an address seeking to stare down potential division about his positions on abortion rights and nuclear power. Crisafulli’s speech to the LNP state council meeting in Rockhampton on Sunday was his first opportunity to speak directly to the organisational wing, and party members, since last month’s state election victory. Despite the election success, LNP sources say there remains consternation in the ranks about the way the party handled divisive issues including abortion and nuclear power, where the views of the grassroots membership – and the private views of many MPs – are at odds with Crisafulli’s promises not to change existing laws. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The premier did not directly mention either issue. But his speech to members hinted at “scare campaigns” by Labor during the election and said these would not work in four years if the party kept its word. “One thing I can guarantee you about me … that is my word counts for something and I value a culture when you say you’re going to do something you do it, and when you say you won’t do something, you won’t do it,” Crisafulli said. “That’s how we keep faith. That’s what we’re going to do in the next four years … “What will happen in four years’ time, the scare campaign that you were all subject to by the Labor party will not work. It won’t, it can’t. “In four years’ time … when we have not done the things we said we wouldn’t do … Queenslanders will see what it’s like to have a government where a word counts for something.” Crisafulli warned members “we won’t get everything we want” and said winning a second term would require compromise. “We don’t exist for culture wars,” he said. We don’t exist to be the strongest in opposition. We exist to bring good government to Queenslanders. “We won’t get everything we want. There will be times where … you have to compromise. Where things are a little bit imperfect. But overall, when you govern, you can embed the kind of things that you want to see for a state.” Crisafulli spoke about the federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and roused party members to “do it one more time” at a federal election, due in the first half of next year. “The more people know about Peter Dutton, the more they like,” Crisafulli said. “There is a reason why he has managed to hold a seat, that on the pendulum shouldn’t be a Liberal National seat. He keeps winning it because people who know him like him. And I like him.” • This story was amended on 18 November 2024.

"abortion","Despite Livia Tossici-Bolt’s conviction, the US is not finished with making abortion a UK culture war issue","I couldn’t sleep the other night, because I made the fatal mistake of reading about US politics directly before bed, specifically the executive order calling for the removal of “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian museums. If US politics were a film, I’d say we’re somewhere in between having read aloud from the book that summons demons as a joke, and the final bloodbath. If JD Vance rewriting history isn’t sinister enough, then came the news that the US state department will be “monitoring” a UK woman’s abortion buffer zone case (why does everything they say always sound so creepy?) They are “concerned”, apparently, “about freedom of expression in the United Kingdom”. The case is that of Livia Tossici-Bolt – who held up a sign reading “Here to talk if you want” outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic and was this morning convicted of breaching the buffer zone. Her case was being funded by the UK branch of Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a rightwing organisation with links to the White House, which has increased its expenditure and activities in this country of late. It has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in the US. Ominously, this isn’t the first time the US has invoked the UK’s abortion clinic buffer zone legislation. In a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance made the false claim that people who live within safe access zones had been sent letters by the Scottish government warning them about praying within their homes. Those comments were dangerous scaremongering, and were condemned as such, while this latest intervention has been blasted as “unjustifiable interference” by the former UK supreme court judge Lord Sumption. There were reports this week that the US was intending to use these spurious concerns over free speech as leverage in trade negotiations, but the business secretary has denied this. Nevertheless, they form part of an increasingly alarming mood music regarding reproductive rights in the UK. “The US state department claims that its concerns over buffer zones are around free speech, but abortion is not a free speech issue,” Sian Norris, author of Bodies Under Siege: How the Far-Right Attack on Reproductive Rights Went Global, tells me. “People can be anti-abortion wherever they like, but they cannot use their speech to harm others and repress women’s human rights.” Norris is concerned but not surprised about the involvement of ADF and 40 Days for Life – a movement to end abortion – whose Bournemouth branch is led by Tossici-Bolt. Why so much interest by US politicians and pressure groups? I don’t believe for a moment that the likes of Vance are truly het up about abortion clinics in the UK. Do they, like Farage, believe that there is some sort of far-right groundswell of opinion in the UK that is waiting to be exploited? I’m not sure there’s an appetite for an abortion culture war here: while I always hesitate to invoke concepts such as national character, I don’t believe that citizens of the UK generally approve of private individuals being impeded from accessing medical treatment. It isn’t polite, or decent, and what people do with their bodies is largely regarded as their own business. As the latest social attitudes survey shows, support for abortion is at an all-time high. That isn’t to say that the question is settled: Labour must do that by putting decriminalisation back on the table as soon as possible. Perhaps all that doesn’t matter. Vance et al know that these comments will play well with the rightwing Christians at home. Having largely won the war in the US by depriving millions of women there of their fundamental human rights with the rollback of Roe v Wade, they are still not satisfied. UK abortion buffer zones are a useful issue to add to the US government’s main culture war – the idea that they are liberating people from “woke” and getting free speech back. Despite the fact that, as Lord Sumption noted, one of the biggest threats to free speech right now is the US, this makes it look as though it is the defender of peaceful protest both at home and abroad. It’s an effective distraction tactic. “OK, so we are literally censoring our national museums right now, but look at how we are supporting this poor woman, who simply held a sign up outside an abortion clinic!” Cynical leaks suggesting that “there’s no free trade without free speech” add to this deliberately crafted impression of the US as a global guardian of freedom of expression. In a way it doesn’t really matter whether UK abortion buffer zone legislation forms a part of trade negotiations: it’s enough that the US has implied that it has and will. Whether Tossici-Bolt’s conviction will prompt further attempts to interfere remains to be seen, but the AFD’s increased interest in the UK is terrifying. This battle isn’t over. There will no doubt be those who think my fears are hysterical, but people said the same when feminists publicly feared for Roe v Wade, and women’s bodies have been battlegrounds for so long that hypervigilance is a natural response. If you’ll forgive me for returning to my horror movie analogy: when you live in a haunted house, you start to see threat around every corner. As for our government – will it robustly defend any perceived attack on British women’s human rights, and publicly condemn the brazen use of US cash to try to influence our laws?

"abortion","Which of our warnings came true in the first year after Trump’s second election?","Last year, as Donald Trump’s campaign promises and policy proposals became increasingly clear, the Guardian published a series called The Stakes to outline the impact the administration would likely have on the country. The stories were broken down by subject matter – spanning civil rights, health, immigration and cities. Much of what was covered in the series has played out on American streets and inside homes since Trump was inaugurated in January. From military-level force used in urban centers, to tens of thousands of federal workers fired by the administration, the effects have been felt at every level. The Guardian’s reporters revisited their reporting to see what happened within one year of the election. What has happened to abortion rights? Abortion rights activists feared that a Trump administration would move to ban abortion nationwide. But rather than mount a full-scale assault on abortion rights, Trump has taken a subtler approach that abortion rights supporters say is endangering women who need abortions to save their lives. After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, Joe Biden’s White House issued guidance clarifying that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala), which blocks hospitals from turning away patients in medical emergencies, protects access to emergency abortions, even in states that ban the procedure. When Idaho banned virtually all abortions, the Biden administration accused the state of violating Emtala, sued Idaho and took the case all the way to the supreme court. The Trump administration then dropped that case and rescinded the Biden-era guidance. Without the reassurance of that guidance, advocates worry that doctors will be too afraid to give patients life-saving abortions. At least five women are believed to have died because post-Roe abortion bans blocked them from care. After prodding by anti-abortion activists, Robert F Kennedy Jr also announced that the Department of Health and Human Services will re-examine access to the abortion pill mifepristone, which is used in most US abortions. The administration may decide to prohibit doctors from prescribing mifepristone through telemedicine, which is increasingly being used to ship pills to people living under abortion bans. Read the original article. What has happened to protest movements? Shortly after taking office, Trump ordered unprecedented measures against protesters. Though demonstrations on college campuses over Israel’s invasion of Gaza had quietened down, his administration had several foreign students who participated in them – one of whom had merely written an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to the war – arrested and put in deportation proceedings. The president also ordered active-duty marines and federalized national guard troops into the streets of Los Angeles after protests broke out against arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants by Immigration and Customs Authority (ICE). He followed that up by ordering the national guard into several other cities to purportedly fight crime and protect immigration agents. The deportations and the national guard deployments are the subject of legal proceedings, which remain ongoing. Read the original article. What has happened to immigration enforcement? The Trump administration has taken extraordinary measures to carry out what the president vowed would be the largest mass deportation campaign in US history. Officials are making record levels of arrests, stretching the US detention system well beyond its capacity. Aggressive raids, carried out by masked agents, have targeted day-labor sites and hardware stores, especially in Latino neighborhoods, as well as restaurants and even immigration courts. Despite claims that the government is seeking only the “worst of the worst”, the majority of people being arrested by ICE now have no criminal convictions. Long settled immigrants, green-card holders, US citizens, foreign students, veterans, journalists and even children with cancer have all been swept up in the operations, resulting in a slew of lawsuits. The president took immediate action to effectively seal the US southern border. Illegal crossings have fallen to decades-lows in recent months as enforcement shifts to the interior. Under Trump, the US has slashed its refugee program – reserving spots mostly for white South Africans. The White House has moved quickly to strip immigrants of legal status and protections as it seeks to end birthright citizenship, outlined in the 14th amendment of the US constitution. Read the original article. What has happened to cities? Trump’s repeated threats to deploy the military in Democratic-run cities to deal with what he erroneously claimed was their “complete breakdown of law and order” have largely come to pass, albeit dampened to some degree by federal court rulings. Trump was open about his intentions to use federalised national guard troops to seize control of urban centers controlled by Democrats. Back in the White House he kept his word, sending the national guard into Los Angeles; Washington DC; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Memphis against the wishes of those cities’ leaders. Federal judges have temporarily blocked several of those moves, including in Portland and Chicago. The US supreme court is currently considering the legality of the Chicago mobilisation. Read the original article. What has happened to the courts? The Stakes explored ways in which Trump might weaponise the federal court system to bend it to his will. So far he has not had the opportunity to appoint any more supreme court justices, with the nine staying put. But then Trump has not needed to. Under the current 6-3 dominance of conservative justices – three of whom were appointed by Trump during his first presidency – the president has been granted almost everything he wanted on the secretive shadow docket, where temporary rulings are issued from the top court often without explanation. Read the original article. What has happened to national parks, protected land and wildlife? At the interior department, the Trump administration has moved aggressively to open federal lands and waters to oil and gas drillers, mining companies and agriculture groups. As the Guardian previously forecast, the administration is pushing to lease large swaths of federal lands to oil and gas or mining companies, including near the famed Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota along with a portion of the Arctic national wildlife refuge. It has reversed a Biden-era rule that would have protected roughly 13m acres of federal land on Alaska’s North Slope, home to endangered polar bears and dozens of migratory bird species. And in September, it announced that it would make some 13 million acres of federal land available for coal leasing. Meanwhile, the administration, largely through the Department of Defense, has begun to invest directly in a handful of mining companies with large-scale projects on public lands and is also advancing efforts to explore for rare earth metals and so-called critical minerals on the ocean floor. The administration has simultaneously weakened bedrock conservation laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. In April, the interior department put forward a proposal that would make it easier for developers to get away with harming endangered species, even as it makes it harder for the public to weigh in on oil, gas and mining projects. And in June, the justice department issued a memo that empowered Trump to abolish national monuments, dealing a blow to the Antiquities Act of 1906, which has been used to protect large parcels of public land across the United States for more than a century. Trump’s team has also engineered a purge of the interior department’s civil service, overseeing a mass departure of employees –including some of the government’s top scientists–from the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service and many other conservation agencies. This effort, led by “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge) operatives and other Trump appointees, continues today as the department aims to lay off thousands of additional civil servants amid the ongoing government shutdown. Read the original article. What has happened to the media? There were widespread fears last year about how a Trump re-election could harm press freedom and American democracy. Trump himself claimed he would be a dictator on the first day in office, and there is no such thing as a free press in a dictatorship. His administration has gone after the reality-based press – through frivolous lawsuits against news organizations, through efforts to restrict access to sources of news, particularly at the defense department. Many news organizations have buckled to Trump’s intimidation or inappropriately attempted to curry favor with him. Vast changes at the Washington Post and at CBS News – two of the most prestigious news companies – have followed. Some news companies, however, have stuck to their principles and stood firm, but American democracy and press rights have been significantly dismantled in a very short time. Read the original article. What has happened to LGBTQ+ rights? LGBTQ+ rights advocates warned last year that a Trump victory would be “catastrophic” for transgender and queer people, particularly trans youth . In nine months, his administration has rapidly rolled back LGBTQ+ protections, pushing discriminatory policies that at times have been more detrimental to families than activists’ dire predictions. Trans youth already struggled to access vital gender-affirming healthcare in red states, but the president’s anti-trans executive orders and funding threats have dramatically reduced treatment options in blue states. Hospitals that have championed LGBTQ+ rights, but rely on federal dollars, have ended long-running trans youth programs, ceasing treatments considered the US standard of care and sending families scrambling for alternatives – or forcing them to flee the country. The administration has also relentlessly targeted schools with policies that are LGBTQ+ inclusive, at times singling out individual trans youth athletes. LGBTQ+ youth mental health has significantly worsened. The president has further fought to ban trans people from the military; worked to invalidate trans and nonbinary people’s passports; revoked fair-housing protections for LGBTQ+ people; shuttered a suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ youth; erased queer and trans people from historical monuments and federal websites; moved incarcerated trans women into men’s prisons; issued devastating cuts to critical HIV prevention programs; and supported efforts to reauthorize discredited conversion practices. Implementation of some policies has been blocked or slowed down by litigation, but the US supreme court has repeatedly backed anti-LGBTQ+ measures, with advocates warning the erosion of rights will continue in the coming months. Read the original article. What has happened to gun control? Shortly after his inauguration, Donald Trump dismantled the White House office of gun violence prevention, and directed Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to review federal gun laws to weed out any “ongoing infringements” of the second amendment. In March, his administration removed an advisory from Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, on gun violence as a public health issue from the US Department of Health and Human Services website. The next month, the justice department cut more than $800m in grants, including community-based violence intervention programs, that were managed by the justice department’s office of justice programs (OJP). While big asks from gun rights organizations have gone unanswered, behind the scenes, Trump’s Department of Justice has also proven to be largely gun-friendly. In April, the justice department nixed a Biden-era “zero-tolerance” policy for gun dealers who willfully failed to follow federal guidelines. In May, the department reversed a years-long precedent that prohibited the sale of devices called forced reset triggers that can be affixed to rifles and allowed to fire rapidly. Before the DoJ’s recent intervention, the items were classified as machine guns. Read the original article. What has happened to foreign policy? Trump has delivered the chaos that many believed his return to the White House would bring. From the messy rollout of his tariffs that disrupted worldwide trade, to his erratic efforts to end the wars in Gaza and in Ukraine, to his redrawing of the map of US allies and rivals, his ad-hoc approach to projecting American power around the world is anything but business as usual. Foreign leaders are looking for ways to build a rapport with Trump – and the various avenues for investment into the Trump family business have created an unprecedented threat for foreign influence on an American president. But he has had successes. Trump has managed to negotiate two ceasefires in Israel’s war in Gaza, though the second came after giving Benjamin Netanyahu a green light to escalating the IDF assault that has left much of the territory uninhabitable. He has managed to cajole US allies in Europe into pledging greater investment in Nato, a campaign promise he managed to fulfill. But his efforts to negotiate an end to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine have been fruitless. His trade war with China has backfired and exposed the US’s need for critical minerals. And now with the US positioning more forces in the Caribbean, a war in Venezuela may be his next big decision.

"abortion","Why speech could be a target for the anti-abortion movement in 2025","The next front in the US abortion wars may be what people are allowed to say about it. More than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in the case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, US abortions are on the rise, thanks in large part to the spread of abortion pills and travel across state lines. This has infuriated anti-abortion advocates, who have proposed policies to help the incoming Trump administration curtail the mailing of abortion pills and targeted individuals and groups that help women get out-of-state abortions. In a sign of how the issue is pitting states against one another, Texas earlier this month sued a New York-based doctor who allegedly provided a telehealth abortion to a Texan woman. In an effort to cut off the avenues remaining to people in states with bans, the anti-abortion movement is looking at ways to control information about how and where to obtain abortions. State lawmakers have filed at least two bills for the 2025 legislative session that target abortion-related speech. “What now matters in a country where a third of the country bans abortion and other states do not is the flow of people, the flow of pills and the flow of information,” said Rachel Rebouché, an expert in reproductive health law and the dean of Temple University’s law school. “Controlling what people can find out about services that are not legal in their state but are legal somewhere else is part of this larger conversation post-Dobbs.” One of the 2025 bills, pre-filed in Texas, would make it illegal to “provide information on how to obtain an abortion-inducing drug” and to maintain a website that “assists or facilitates a person’s effort in obtaining an abortion-inducing drug”. It would also force internet service providers to block people from accessing websites run by Aid Access, Plan C and other groups that help people obtain medication abortions, even when they’re doing so through the healthcare system. The second bill, which was pre-filed in New Hampshire, would ban “abortion trafficking”, or the practice of transporting minors for abortions without their parents’ permission, as well as forbid people from “recruiting” minors for having abortions. This kind of language, which appears in model legislation written by the prominent anti-abortion group National Right to Life, has left abortion rights activists fearful – especially since two states, Idaho and Tennessee, have already passed laws to ban abortion trafficking and “recruiting”. Abortion is legal in New Hampshire until 24 weeks of pregnancy. The language in the bills could have far-reaching consequences. “There is no specific meaning to what ‘recruiting’ is in the law. It could be anything – like having a conversation with someone, sharing general information, persuading,” said Kylee Sunderlin, director of legal services at If/When/How, which runs a helpline for people looking for information about abortion, miscarriage and birth. Sunderlin continued: “If totally factual information that I provide to someone through the Repro Legal Helpline in some way persuades them toward the decision to have an abortion, then, yeah, that could definitely be seen as ‘recruiting’.” Earlier this month, the San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals ruled to let most of Idaho’s abortion trafficking ban take effect but froze the “recruiting” provision, which the judge M Margaret McKeown said would likely curtail speech protected by the first amendment. Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, believes the attempt to restrict “recruiting” young people is likely a trial balloon for future laws that target people of all ages. “Every ban that we have seen on adult access to care started with a ban on youth access to care,” Smith said. Abortion opponents have also experimented with recategorizing specific kinds of talk. In 2024, lawmakers in Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma and West Virginia introduced bills to limit abortion-related speech. Three of those bills would have restricted advertising around abortion, such as billboards that let people know about out-of-state options. Under US constitutional law, commercial speech – such as advertising – is often easier to regulate than political speech. Although the 1975 supreme court case Bigelow v Virginia has protected advertising around abortion, Harvard Law School lecturer Dessie Otachliska isn’t convinced that it would survive a return to the modern-day, hyper-conservative supreme court. “That opinion is a little bit shaky. There’s ways to overturn it,” said Otachliska, who has written about post-Roe threats to abortion-related speech. “It could be that there is a pathway where certain advocates are hoping or thinking that if Bigelow goes back in front of the supreme court, that precedent will fall.” A federal court has also temporarily blocked Tennessee’s abortion trafficking ban. The state has appealed that ruling. Especially if the outcome is different from the appeals court ruling in the Idaho case, the supreme court may decide to step in and rule on the contours of abortion-related speech and what it means to “recruit” a young person for an abortion. “Because these are novel laws that are being passed by more and more states, it signals that the issue is not going away,” Rebouché said.","2024-12-27T13:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/27/speech-anti-abortion-movement"
"abortion","Liz Cheney urges conservatives to back Kamala Harris over abortion","Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, on Monday condemned Republican-imposed bans on the procedure and urged conservatives to support the Democrat Kamala Harris for US president. Cheney was speaking during three joint events with the vice-president in three swing states aimed at prising suburban Republican voters away from the party nominee, Donald Trump. She has become the Democrat’s most prominent conservative surrogate and is rumoured to be in contention for a seat in a potential Harris cabinet. At the final event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, against a blue backdrop patterned with the words “country over party”, Cheney, 58, suggested that Republican-led states had overreached in restricting abortion since the supreme court’s 2022 Dobbs decision ended it as a constitutional right. “I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs,” said the former Wyoming congresswoman and daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney. “I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who – as the vice-president said, in some cases have died – who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.” The current situation is “untenable”, Cheney said, and America needs a president “who understands how important compassion is, who understands that these shouldn’t be political issues, that we ought to be able to have these discussions and say, ‘You know what? Even if you are pro-life, as I am, I do not believe, for example, that the state of Texas ought to have the right, as they’re currently suing to do, to get access to women’s medical records.’ “There are some very fundamental and fundamentally dangerous things that have happened and so I think that it’s crucially important for us to find ways to have the federal government play a role and protect women from some of the worst harms that we’re seeing.” Cheney went on to draw a contrast with Trump, who as president appointed three supreme court justices instrumental in overturning the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent and whose rhetoric continues to alienate many suburban women. “Donald Trump at one point called for criminal penalties for women,” she said. “He’s been now trying to sort of be all over the place on this issue, although he expresses great pride for what’s happened and I think the bottom line on this, as on so many other issues, is you just can’t count on him. You cannot trust him. We’ve seen the man that he is. We’ve seen the cruelty and America deserves much better.” The remarks echoed comments that Cheney made earlier in the day in Malvern, a suburb of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, in a striking effort to build a permission structure for conservatives to back Harris, who has made reproductive freedom a centrepiece of her campaign. Cheney, by contrast, has an A rating from Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America, a group that grades members of Congress based on their anti-abortion credentials. Monday’s three events in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, a show of unity designed to cast Trump as a threat to the constitution, were held in counties won by Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations, had sought to neutralise abortion as an election issue by supporting states’ autonomy and rejecting calls for a national ban. Cheney has vocally opposed Trump since the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Her recent endorsement of Harris fuelled speculation that she could play a part in a future Harris administration. Don’t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Earlier this month, appearing on the popular daytime talkshow The View, Harris said she would differ from Joe Biden by including a Republican in her cabinet. She was asked by the radio host Howard Stern if that might be Cheney but avoided a direct answer. Appointing Cheney would carry considerable political risks given her hawkish foreign policy and her father’s role in instigating the Iraq war. Trump has frequently tried to paint Harris, who is from deep blue California, as a radical liberal but she struck a moderate tone during her appearances with Cheney, who lost her House seat after she co-chaired a congressional committee that investigated the January 6 attack. Harris promised to “invite good ideas from wherever they come” and “cut red tape”, and she said “there should be a healthy two-party system” in the country. “We need to be able to have these good intense debates about issues that are grounded in fact,” she said. “Imagine!” Cheney responded. “Let’s start there!” Harris said as the audience clapped. “Can you believe that’s an applause line?” Foreign policy loomed large over the three conversations as Harris and Cheney described Trump as chaotic, erratic and unfit to lead. In Waukesha, at an event moderated by the conservative author and broadcaster Charlie Sykes, Cheney highlighted Trump’s admiration for autocrats such as Vladimir Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un of North Korea and Xi Jinping of China. “If you listen to him, he doesn’t just praise those people generally,” she said. “He praises them for their cruelty, for their tyranny. That’s not who we are as a nation. It’s not who we are and the world needs us to be better.” Harris criticised Trump’s claim that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war in a day as tantamount to “surrender”, explaining: “Vladimir Putin would be sitting in Kyiv if Donald Trump were president and understand what that means, as our allies understand, and that’s why they’re concerned about this election. “If Putin were to get away with invading the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine … you think he wouldn’t march next right into Poland and the rest of Europe? Because Donald Trump wants to please somebody that he considers to be a strongman who he admires? So on this, and so many issues, the stakes are extremely high.” But some observers questioned the wisdom of campaigning with Cheney in Michigan, which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, given her hawkish foreign policy and her father’s role in instigating the Iraq war. Many such voters are now wavering or abstaining because of the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the crisis in Gaza. Trump weighed in on Monday, writing on his Truth Social platform: “Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris, the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States and a Low IQ individual, is campaigning with ‘dumb as a rock’ War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind.” The Michigan event was held in Royal Oak, outside Detroit, and moderated by Maria Shriver, a journalist and former first lady of California. In a nod to the concept of shy Harris voters who would rather not share their views publicly, Cheney said: “If you’re at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody and there will be millions of Republicans who do that on November 5.” In a lighter moment, Shriver asked Harris – who turned 60 on Sunday – about what she is doing to de-stress, noting that Americans say they are turning off the news, doing yoga, “eating gummies, all sorts of things”. Harris replied: “Not eating gummies!” and burst into laughter. She admitted: “I wake up in the middle of the night usually these days, just to be honest with you, but I work out every morning. I think that’s really important to just kind of – you know, mind, body and spirit … My family grounds me in every way.” But Harris counselled against despair: “Let’s not feel powerless … because then we have been defeated and that’s not our character as the American people.” More than 100 former Republican officeholders and officials joined Harris last week in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, not far from where general George Washington led hundreds of troops across the Delaware River to a major victory in the revolutionary war. At a rally there, Cheney told Republican voters that the patriotic choice was to vote for Democrats. She and Harris appeared to have a good chemistry during their swing state tour. At one point in Wisconsin, Cheney observed: “If you wouldn’t hire somebody to babysit your kids, you shouldn’t make that guy the president of the United States.” The audience laughed. And no one seemed more amused than Harris herself.","2024-10-22T03:40:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/21/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-abortion"
"abortion","Ron DeSantis accused of ‘intimidation campaign’ against abortion rights","Ron DeSantis is making a concerted effort to maintain draconian limits on abortion access in Florida that have led to accusations the rightwing Republican governor is conducting a “state-sponsored intimidation campaign” against abortion rights and trampling on civil liberties in the state. A near total ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect in Florida in May after the state supreme court ruled that the right to an abortion was no longer covered by the privacy clause in the Florida constitution. Passage of legislation called Amendment 4 would change the state constitution to prohibit government interference with the right to an abortion before the viability of a fetus, which typically begins around the 24th week of a pregnancy. But registered voters in Florida have recently reported unannounced visits from law enforcement personnel that appear to be part of an all-out drive by DeSantis to use state government agencies and public funds to block passage of Amendment 4, which would enshrine in the state constitution a woman’s right to an abortion. The experience of Isaac Menasche is a cautionary tale. In early September, Menasche received an unexpected visitor at his home in the Florida Gulf coast city of Fort Myers – a plainclothes detective with a badge and a folder stuffed with documents containing Menasche’s personal information. They included copies of his driver’s license and a petition form he had signed months ago at a local farmer’s market on behalf of a campaign to qualify a pro-choice referendum for the statewide ballot in this year’s general election. The detective who turned up on Menasche’s doorstep wanted to know why his signature on the petition form did not match the one on his driver’s license. The retired 71-year-old attorney conceded the point but explained that his signature can sometimes vary. The officer left shortly thereafter. “The experience left me shaken,” wrote the New Jersey native on his Facebook page that same day. “It was obvious to me that a significant effort was exerted to determine if indeed I had signed the petition. Troubling that so much resources were devoted to this.” DeSantis initially asked the Florida supreme court to declare the ballot measure unconstitutional on the grounds that its language was vague and misleading. When that ploy failed last April, DeSantis shifted gears: in July a senior official in the state government department in charge of elections announced a review for possible fraud of tens of thousands of petition signatures collected in four counties in support of Amendment 4. In more recent weeks, the state-run Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has launched a website opposing the initiative on the grounds that it “threatens women’s safety”. It has also spent millions of dollars on television ads urging Florida voters to reject the proposed amendment. “We’re seeing a state-sponsored intimidation campaign to make Floridians scared of voicing support for abortion access,” says Keisha Mulfort, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida which filed a lawsuit earlier this month seeking to halt the AHCA’s anti-Amendment 4 media campaign. “Florida’s leadership has made it clear they don’t trust women to make decisions about their own healthcare,” she added. “They’ll go to great lengths to demonstrate they don’t support the democratic process, including sending law enforcement personnel to the homes of private citizens.” DeSantis recently defended the state-funded anti-amendment website and television ads as “public service announcements” similar to those produced by the Florida department of transportation to encourage safe driving. “It’s being used by the AHCA agency to basically provide people with accurate information,” said the governor during a roundtable discussion held in a Miami suburb on 9 September. “Everything that is put out is factual. That’s been done for decades, it’s not electioneering, and it is not inappropriate at all.” The AHCA communications office failed to respond to a list of written questions submitted by the Guardian about the agency’s website and electronic media campaign. The governor’s communications director, Bryan Griffin, turned down The Guardian’s request for an interview with DeSantis, asserting that the newspaper was “completely consumed with left wing activism and does nothing to actually inform the public.” Under a law passed by the Republican-dominated Florida legislature, ballot measures must be approved by 60% of the electorate, and Amendment 4 proponents say they are confident of meeting that threshold in the general election scheduled for 5 November. To bolster his case against the pro-choice amendment proposal, DeSantis has even questioned the legitimacy of passing laws through popular referendums, even though that mechanism is authorized by the state constitution. “It takes power away from the people to be able to decide this through elections and who they elect to office and who legislates,” he told a press conference recently. “It effectively puts it in the courts, and there will be 25 years’ worth of lawsuits on what any of these terms mean.” In a letter dated 25 January of this year, the Florida department of state’s division of elections confirmed that the six organizations in support of the pro-choice referendum had collected enough valid signatures to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the November ballot. Six months later, however, a deputy secretary of that same state government department revealed in a letter that his office had received “alarming information” from the Palm Beach county supervisor of elections office about “fraudulent constitutional initiative petitions” that were submitted by 35 individuals who had been hired to collect signatures on behalf of Amendment 4. This apparent attempt to reopen the signature validity issue was replicated in three other counties in Florida, and as of two weeks ago an estimated 36,000 signatures are currently under review by an election fraud unit that was established by legislation that DeSantis signed into law two years ago. The Palm Beach county supervisor of elections, Wendy Sartory Link, received an email four weeks ago from that deputy secretary of state, Brad McVay, asking her office to review 17,637 petition forms that were certified as valid by her office last winter. The elections supervisor said the request from McVay was “not a common practice” that she had encountered in the five years since she was appointed to the position by DeSantis. Link is running for re-election this year as a Democrat, and she suggested that the entire exercise might be an academic one at this juncture. “It doesn’t really apply to us,” she said. “The initiative was certified, and it’s on our ballots.”","2024-09-29T15:30:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/desantis-abortion-election-florida"
"abortion","Gretchen Whitmer calls Trump ‘deranged’ after comments on abortion","Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, called Donald Trump “just deranged” on Sunday after he said women would no longer be thinking about abortion if he is elected as president in November. “This guy just doesn’t understand what the average woman is confronting in her life in this country, and how could he? He’s not lived a normal life,” Whitmer said in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Whitmer also reaffirmed her support for Kamala Harris, describing her as a person “who has worked hourly jobs, who knows how important it is that women have healthcare and access to the medical care that they need”. Whitmer was asked to comment about a speech the former president delivered on Saturday, saying women “will be happy, healthy, confident, and free” if he is elected president. “He’s just deranged,” the governor of Michigan said. On Friday, Trump made similar comments about women on his Truth Social platform. “WOMEN ARE POORER THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO, ARE LESS HEALTHY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO … AND ARE LESS OPTIMISTIC AND CONFIDENT IN THE FUTURE THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO!” Trump said. Harris is a staunch supporter of abortion rights. The vice-president delivered two speeches on Friday, first in Georgia and then Wisconsin, highlighting the case of Amber Thurman, who died in Georgia due to a strict abortion ban. Whitmer’s comments on Sunday come a week after participating in an online campaign event with TV host, producer and author Oprah Winfrey, which was livestreamed nationally from Michigan. The Michigan governor was previously named as a possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president before ruling herself out in July. Michigan is a must-win prize for candidates, a state that has voted for the presidential winner in the last four national elections. Joe Biden took Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020. Two years later, Whitmer defeated a Trump-backed candidate and Democrats took full control for the first time in 45 years.","2024-09-22T17:07:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/22/gretchen-whitmer-calls-trump-deranged-after-comments-on-abortion"
"abortion","Amy Coney Barrett says supreme court rulings are ‘not opinion polls’","US supreme court rulings are “not just an opinion poll” of its nine judges’ beliefs, conservative Amy Coney Barrett says, as she and her colleagues weigh a request to overturn the legalization of same-sex marriage. “The court should not be imposing its own values on the American people,” Barrett remarked in a preview of an interview airing on the latest episode of CBS News Sunday Morning. “That’s for the democratic process.” Barrett delivered her comments in what was billed as her first television interview since she joined the supreme court in 2020 – a conversation with the Sunday Morning host Norah O’Donnell meant to promote her new book, Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution. In the book, set for publication on 9 September, Barrett asserted her belief that the June 2022 ruling that struck down abortion rights nationally “respected the choice” of Americans. She wrote that she believed the 7-2 Roe v Wade ruling that established those federal abortion rights had “usurped the will of the American people”, as put by CNN, which ran an excerpt of the book a week before its release date. Yet more than 60% of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a May 2024 poll found. That was only four points higher than in 2021, a year before Barrett joined four other ultraconservatives in removing national abortion access protections, clearing the way for numerous states to quickly ban or severely restrict the procedure. Meanwhile, a May 2025 Gallup poll found 68% support for legal same-sex marriage. Nonetheless, Barrett and her colleagues have been asked to overturn the 2015 Obergefell v Hodges supreme court ruling that recognized same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. The former Kentucky county court clerk Kim Davis, who stopped issuing marriage licenses in the aftermath of the Obergefell decision, made the request. In a recent interview with the Raging Moderates political podcast co-host Jessica Tarlov the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton predicted the supreme court “will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion”. “They will send it back to the states,” Clinton, who Donald Trump defeated in 2016 to win the first of his two presidencies, said to Tarlov. When O’Donnell mentioned Clinton’s prediction to Barrett, the justice replied: “People who criticize the court or who are outside say a lot of different things. “The point that I make in the book is that we have to tune those things out.” Barrett’s nomination and confirmation were rushed through the US Senate by the Republican majority leader at the time, Mitch McConnell, within weeks of the death of the veteran liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It gave Trump his third supreme court pick along with a 6-3 conservative supermajority that has consistently ruled in his favor for his second presidency, which began in January, including landmark decisions expanding Oval Office powers. Barrett’s confirmation was just eight days before the November 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden. It contrasted sharply with McConnell’s handling of the aftermath of the death of another justice, the conservative Antonin Scalia, in February 2016. McConnell back then touted his successful stalling of Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost a year, until Trump took office for his first presidency and replaced Scalia with Neil Gorsuch in April 2017. CNN reported that references to Trump in Barrett’s book – for which she is said to have been paid a $2m advance – were “only in passing”. O’Donnell pointed out to Barrett that in her book the justice wrote that “the rights to marry, engage in sexual intimacy, use birth control and raise children are fundamental, but the rights to do business, commit suicide and obtain abortion are not”. “I want Americans to understand the law – and that it’s not just an opinion poll about whether the supreme court thinks something is good or … bad,” Barrett said. “What the court is trying to do is see what the American people have decided.”","2025-09-06T13:00:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-rulings"
"abortion","US abortion rights supporters see victories despite major loss in Florida","Abortion rights supporters celebrated a handful of victories on Tuesday night, as several states voted to enshrine protections for the procedure into their constitutions. However, they lost what was arguably their hardest fight, after Florida voters defeated a measure to roll back the state’s six-week abortion ban, breaking a streak of ballot-measure victories kicked off when Roe v Wade was overturned by the US supreme court in 2022. They also fell short in Nebraska, where voters chose to enshrine the state’s existing 12-week ban rather than expand protections for the procedure to 24 weeks. And they lost in South Dakota, thereby preserving a state law that makes it a felony to perform an abortion except to save the life of the mother. But abortion rights won in several other states, with Missouri voting to overturn the state’s near-total ban on abortion – a post-Roe first – and establish a constitutional right to abortion until fetal viability. Ballot measures in New York, Colorado and Maryland also passed, expanding their protections for abortion and cementing those states’ status as abortion havens. In Nevada, a ballot measure to enshrine the battleground state’s abortion rights in the state constitution received its first nod of approval, though voters must also approve the ballot question in 2026 in order to amend the state constitution. Another key presidential swing state, Arizona, approved its ballot measure to establish a fundamental right to abortion and prohibit the state from restricting or banning abortion before 24 weeks – a major win for abortion-rights supporters who sought to expand access beyond 15 weeks. And Montana voters, too, chose to protect the right to an abortion in their state constitution – enshrining a 1999 Montana supreme court ruling that said the constitutional right to privacy protects the right to a “pre-viability” abortion – though there is no defined time frame, it typically occurs around 24 weeks. “The people of Missouri – be they Democrat, Republican, or independent – have resoundingly declared that they don’t want politicians involved in their private medical decisions,” said Rachel Sweet, the manager of the campaign of the Missouri ballot measure, in a statement. A total of 10 states voted on abortion-related ballot initiatives on Tuesday. Results are forthcoming in four more states. Given that abortion is one of the top issues in the 2024 election, Democrats had hoped these measures would boost turnout among their base and propel Kamala Harris to victory. But polls suggest many voters in effect split their votes by supporting both abortion rights and Donald Trump, whose three supreme court appointments helped end federal protections for the procedure. In recent months, Trump backtracked on his anti-abortion bona fides, but he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue and has many allies who would like to see a national ban enacted. Out of all the abortion-related measures, the Florida initiative – known as amendment 4 – was long considered the most difficult to pass. Unlike other measures, which only require a simple majority – or, in the case of Colorado, 55% of the vote – to pass, the Florida measure needed to garner 60% of the vote. At the time it was called by the Associated Press, the Florida measure had amassed a clear majority, with 57% of the vote. The Florida result is a bitter pill for abortion rights supporters, shattering a string of successes at the ballot box. Advocates have won abortion-related ballot measures in seven states since Roe was overturned. After the US supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, Florida became a refuge for people fleeing the abortion bans that now blanket the rest of the US south, before its six-week ban took effect in May of this year. Had the Florida measure passed on Tuesday, it would have protected the right to abortion up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks into pregnancy. In the weeks leading up to election day, Florida Republicans alarmed civil rights and voting rights groups by unleashing a wave of attacks on the measure. Law enforcement officials investigated people who signed a petition to get the measure on to the ballot, while the state’s agency for healthcare administration put up a webpage attacking the amendment. The health department also sent cease-and-desist letters to local TV stations that aired an advertisement supporting the measure, prompting the measure’s organizers to sue. “Florida’s deadly abortion ban is out of line with the values of our state,” said Lauren Brenzel, manager of the campaign for the amendment, Yes on 4 Florida, in a statement. “Florida voters sent that message loud and clear today, and despite the fact that only a minority of voters voted to retain the abortion ban our extremist government will exploit the situation to deny its own constituents the right to decide on our bodily autonomy.” Read more of the Guardian’s 2024 US election coverage When do polls close?

"abortion","Calls for abortion law change in England after couple sentenced for buying pills","The prosecution of a young couple who were handed community orders at Gloucester crown court more than six years after the stillbirth of a baby has led to renewed calls for abortion law reform in England. Sophie Harvey and Elliot Benham, both now 25, were originally arrested on suspicion of murder after they disposed of a stillborn foetus. The couple, who were each 19 at the time, had sought a termination for an unwanted pregnancy, before discovering that Harvey was “too far gone” – beyond the legal time limit – with gestation estimated to be at about 28 weeks and five days. At Gloucester crown court on Wednesday, the prosecution barrister Anna Vigars said that after they were denied a legal abortion Benham had searched online for alternatives, adding: “Some of them drugs, some of them herbal, none of them legal.” Benham admitted ordering illegal abortion drugs by post, although the couple maintained that Harvey never took them and the baby was stillborn before the tablets arrived. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to procure a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage, and a second count of endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child. Abortion is illegal under English law and punishable with up to life in prison, but the Abortion Act of 1967 sets out certain scenarios in which an abortion can legally be carried out, with the approval of two doctors. The time limit in most cases is 24 weeks but there is no limit in some situations, such as when the foetus has a fatal abnormality or when the mother’s life is at risk. Sentencing the pair, Judge Lawrie said they had been traumatised by the lengthy criminal process, which had involved the jury being discharged in a trial against them after inaccurate reports of the proceedings by the BBC. “It has been a long and painful journey,” the judge said, adding: “The impact upon your lives has been traumatic and I am sure this will continue for some time.” An attempt earlier this year to change the law via amendments to the last Conservative government’s criminal justice bill failed when none of these were put to a vote. It followed the prosecutions of several women accused of taking abortion pills illegally, most notably Carla Foster, who was jailed. With this week’s sentencing, and some predicting the new Labour government’s crime and policing bill may come before parliament as early as January, renewed calls for changes to the law have begun. “Whatever you feel about abortion, it’s never in the public interest for anyone to be prosecuted for ending their own pregnancy,” Louise McCudden, the UK head of external affairs at MSI Reproductive Choices, a leading provider of abortion services in the UK, said: “These Victorian laws have been on the statute books for a century and a half – and have real consequences today. “The young woman at the centre of this distressing story needed compassion and advice she could trust, not criminal prosecution and public shaming. If she had been given support at an earlier stage, perhaps this painful outcome could have been avoided.” Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the charity the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: “Prosecuting women for seeking to end their pregnancies is never in the public interest. This case exposes the harmful and unnecessary criminalisation of women under laws written more than 160 years ago. “Instead of compassion and support, this young woman has been met with stigma, shame, and a protracted legal process that has disrupted her life for years.” Jemima Olchawski, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, a charity for gender equality and women’s rights, said: “Restricting women’s access to abortion puts our health and lives at risk. No woman should be forced to continue a pregnancy against her will. “It can never be in the public interest to prosecute in cases like this – abortion is healthcare and women seeking healthcare must not be criminalised. The law that allowed this to happen is so old it predates women’s suffrage – it is in no way fit for purpose in modern-day Britain.” Dr Jonathan Lord, from the British Society of Abortion Care Providers, said: “The law is causing life-changing harm to vulnerable women and girls. What’s happening, the horrific way the women are being treated – including those with premature labours and natural later pregnancy losses – is a national scandal. The Labour MP Stella Creasy, who had put forward the proposed amendments to the criminal justice bill, is also continuing to push for legislative change. “It’s time to decriminalise abortion and recognise this is a healthcare matter,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “All women have access to safe and legal abortions on the NHS. We recognise that this is an extremely sensitive issue, and there are strongly held views on all sides of the discussion. That is why, by longstanding convention, any change to the law in this area would be a matter of conscience for individual MPs rather than the government. “Decisions to prosecute – within existing legislation – are for the CPS and are incredibly rare.”","2024-12-19T12:12:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/calls-abortion-law-change-england-couple-sentenced-buying-pills"
"abortion","Two Sydney hospital employees critical after car mounts footpath and strikes them outside entrance – as it happened","We will be leaving it there – thanks for joining us. Here’s what we covered today: The teal independents will oppose Labor’s rewrite of environment protection laws when the bill is put to a vote in the lower house in coming days. Sussan Ley said she will convene the Liberal party in the next fortnight to finally decide on a net zero and climate position, after weeks of uncertainty over their position and pressure from the Nationals and rightwing Liberals to dump the 2050 target. The government announced that two new platforms were being added to the social media ban for under-16s including Reddit and Kick. The government passed its bill to establish a centre for disease control through the Senate with amendments from the Greens. The government and Coalition voted on David Pocock’s amendment to the motion to force the government to provide the government board appointments report by 24 November. Data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare revealed that that total government expenditure on public health has fallen by nearly 30%. Two hospital employees have been seriously injured after a car struck them while they stood at the entrance to a Sydney hospital. Communications minister says replacing Optus CEO will not assure triple zero Anika Wells, the communications minister, said replacing Optus chief executive officer Stephen Rue would not help assure the triple zero system, responding to calls for him to resign on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. She said the Optus CEO’s position is “not a question for me to decide”: As the steward of the telco system, my question is, if he is not going to do it, who is going to do it? We all have a role to play here, but of all of us, Optus has the biggest role to play. That is why they will face more punitive measures from Acma when the Acma investigation comes back. This post was removed because it contained embargoed content. Academics say their net zero costing is being ‘misrepresented’ after Nationals repeat $9tn claim University energy researchers say their modelling of the economics of Australia reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions – used by the Nationals and some Liberal MPs as part of a justification to drop the goal – has been misrepresented. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has repeatedly claimed that reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions would “cost Australians $9tn”, pointing to the work of Net Zero Australia (NZA). The Nationals this week confirmed they would no longer support the target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and the Coalition is facing internal pressure from some MPs to follow suit. But on Wednesday, NZA – which includes academics from Princeton University, the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland – released a statement saying its cost estimates had been misrepresented. More on this story here: Giving government power to cancel welfare payments over arrest warrants is ‘step towards authoritarianism’, civil liberties council says The NSW Council for Civil Liberties has warned against a bill proposed by the federal government that would give it the power to cancel an individual’s welfare payments if an arrest warrant was issued against that individual. Timothy Roberts, president of the council, said: The presumption of innocence is a non-negotiable for a democracy. This amendment undermines this essential democratic concept. The cancellation of welfare payments could mean homelessness and hunger for the accused person, when they have not been convicted of an offence. NSWCCL calls on the Albanese government to not take this step towards authoritarianism, where a politician acts as judge and jury to punish someone who has not been convicted by a court. Roberts echoed concerns it would disproportionately harm First Nations peoples and victims of domestic violence. Two hospital employees have been seriously injured after a car struck them while they stood at the entrance to a Sydney hospital. NSW police said emergency services responded at about 10am this morning after a 59-year-old woman mounted the footpath at Concord hospital and collided with the two people. The injured pair – a 24-year-old woman and a 47-year-old man who both work at Concord hospital – were in a critical condition. The woman was taken to Westmead hospital and the man to Royal Prince Alfred hospital. “Officers from Burwood Police Area Command established a crime scene which will be examined by specialist police from the Crash Investigation Unit,” police said. Optus reports mobile network outage in the NSW Hunter Valley region Optus has advised customers in the Hunter Valley region that there is an outage of its voice and data services in the area, with triple zero calls potentially affected for some. There was a break in its fibre affecting customers in Port Stephens, Maitland and the surrounding areas. It comes just days after executives fronted a Senate inquiry on the company’s September triple zero outage during which several people died. In its submission to the inquiry, it noted there was a network uptime of 99.45% for the past quarter. There were 332 significant local outages between the end of June and 11 October this year, the company said. Optus apologised for the Hunter Valley outage and committed to providing regular updates. Communications minister defends timeline for under-16s social media ban and gambling reform The minister for communications, Anika Wells, rejected suggestions the social media ban for under 16s is “last minute” while appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Wells announced on Wednesday that Reddit and Kick would join the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X, Youtube and TikTok when the ban came into effect from 10 December. She said: We handed down the rules shortly after I became the minister, we handed down the regulatory guidance a few weeks back now. The list is more clarity for parents because parents want to know and we want them having those discussions with their young people ahead of 10 December. When asked about developments on gambling reform, Wells could not give a timeline for when recommendations from the 2023 inquiry into gambling would be implemented and said “the work continues.” She said: I couldn’t give you a timeline about how we would land a deal in aged care until the day that I landed on your desk to say I have a deal. I will do it in the same way, keep plugging away to get it done. Press gallery thumps politicians 7-1 in rain-soaked soccer match While we’re on the topic of sport, a brief report delayed from yesterday’s parliamentary press v politicians soccer (football) game, won convincingly by the journos in driving rain. The politicians team were on the back foot from the opening whistle, falling behind early by a few goals as the Canberra weather steadfastly refused to agree it was spring. The rain was constant, the cold more akin to winter, but the passes and chemistry among the media pack remained hot. AAP’s Dominic Giannini and Jacob Shteyman got quick opening goals, with the MPs’ team including Sam Rae, Aaron Violi, Josh Burns and Jerome Laxale struggling for answers. A few more quickfire goals banged in, as minister Matt Keogh suffered a knock but shook it off. Liberal MPs Violi and Simon Kennedy had some decent results when they focused through the centre and on the left wing, but efforts toward the right wing were – as usual – unproductive and did not yield any good outcomes, culminating in another net zero effect on the scoreboard. Some stout defence from Millie Muroi and Natassia Chrysanthos from the Nine newspapers shut down numerous attacking raids, leading to goals shared around the team, before your humble correspondent added another to the tally. Laxale, moving from the defensive line and into the forward line as a tall target, managed to pull back one consolation goal at the death. Some optimistic MPs claimed it would be a “last goal wins” situation, but the press gallery took home a decisive 7-1 win. Parliamentary touch football match ends with NSW MPs victorious over Queensland To briefly break into some sports reporting, the annual parliamentary State of Origin touch football match this morning saw a hard-fought win by New South Wales over Queensland. In a tight 1-0 result, Liberal MP Simon Kennedy scored an early try which would turn out to be the match-winner and only point scored all game, and which earned him player of the match honours. The prize: an Australian footy jersey signed by players from the prime minister’s XIII team. I’m reliably informed it was the sixth straight victory for NSW over QLD, a dynasty now coming up on rivalling the famous Maroons victory streak starting in the mid-2000s. NSW rugby league captain Boyd Cordner and QLD legend Ben Hannant joined the respective teams as guest players, adding some athletic prowess to a star-studded roster of MPs from across the aisle. Victorian MPs Josh Burns, Aaron Violi and Sam Birrell suited up for QLD, in another instalment in the long-running controversy where the Maroons will claim players from anywhere. They joined Matt Canavan and Barnaby Joyce, who combined dangerously around the ruck but couldn’t get over the line despite making a lot of noise. For the Blues, a freshly shaven Dan Repacholi, Pat Conroy, Sam Rae, Sally Sitou and Matt Thistlethwaite kept their opponents scoreless. It was a tight game with few highlights but a lot of energy, with Kennedy and Joyce vocal on the sidelines as they barked orders to their teammates. Shadow environment minister ‘won’t enter into ifs or buts’ over net zero speculation Angie Bell, the shadow environment minister, has refused to answer if she considers it would be risky electorally for the Liberal party to dump the 2050 net zero target and oppose the proposed nature laws. Appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing a short time ago, Bell was asked how it could do both and remain a credible party on the environment. Bell said: Well, I think you are assuming what we will do. Neither of those things have actually been done at the moment. Both of those things are in train … I think it’s important that we look at where those two processes are up to. It’s unfair [to say] that we are poised to do anything. We have another party room coming up outside of parliamentary sitting. Bell was then asked: “If you were to say no to both, do you see that would be risky electorally?” Bell responded: I won’t enter into ifs or buts on that. We will continue with the process on both of those things. Republicans accuse Pentagon officials of undermining Trump’s commitment to Aukus Debate over America’s commitment to Aukus continues within that country’s fiercely contested domestic politics, with key Republican figures accusing Pentagon officials of an insufficient commitment to the deal. The tripartite nuclear submarine deal – between the US, the UK and Australia – is the current subject of a Pentagon review, but received full-throated backing from the president during the Australian prime minister’s recent trip to the US: “We’re just going full steam ahead,” Donald Trump said last month. Republicans on the influential Senate Armed Services committee told a hearing in Washington DC they were concerned that the Pentagon’s policy team, led by undersecretary of defence Elbridge Colby, was undermining the president’s defence agenda. Senate committee chair Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, told the committee in a statement: At times, Pentagon officials have pursued policies that are not in accord with President Trump’s orders. I have been disappointed to see the president’s decisions apparently slow-walked or reversed at other points this year … the Aukus deal was cast into doubt despite the president’s strong support of the agreement – much to the surprise and dismay of Australia, one of our most steadfast allies. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican from Alaska, told a committee hearing that key decisions made by the Pentagon’s policy were “undermining what the president is trying to get done”. He said senior Pentagon figures were secretive and unaccountable: I can’t even get a response, and we’re on your team! The comments were made during a nominations hearing for a series of positions within the Department of Defense. Greens say they will oppose Labor’s environment law changes in lower house The Greens will vote against the government’s EPBC environmental laws in the lower house this week. As reported yesterday, the party does not believe the legislation goes far enough to protect forests and address climate change, leaning too much towards mining and industry interests, but hasn’t ruled out amendments in the Senate. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young confirmed this afternoon the party “cannot support this package and will be voting against it in the House of Representatives”: These laws have been criticised by every major environment and climate group, but welcomed by the likes of BHP, Chevron and the BCA. This shows exactly who the laws are written for. It is now up to the Prime Minister to decide if he wants to again let mining and logging lobbyists and their political representatives like Roger Cook run the show, or if he wants to protect nature, forests and our climate. The Greens have one member in the federal lower house: MP for the Queensland seat of Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown. Hello, I’ll now be with you until this evening. Thank you all for following along on the blog with me today. I’ll leave you with the lovely Jordyn Beazley, and will see you here bright and early tomorrow morning for the final sitting day of the fortnight. Tl;dr here’s what happened in question time The opposition started out attacking the government on cost of living again, and we got very similar questions and very similar answers to what we’ve been hearing all week. Alex Hawke, Jim Chalmers and Tony Burke traded barbs over calling MPs “liars” in the chamber. Nicolette Boele asked Chalmers about tax incentives for food donation charities – there was no clear answer on whether the government would introduce them. The opposition then cited data from Foodbank to attack the government, which saw a prompt return serve from the PM who questioned their tactics committee and said the Coalition had stripped funding from the charity. Anthony Albanese was asked twice about a Labor backbencher’s media appearance, telling the public energy bills will dip 20% (on the second try we got an actual answer from him on where the figure had come from). Hang in there folks – one more sitting day to go! In the Senate, ahead of question time, conservative Alex Antic hit out at Sussan Ley over her comments to ABC AM this morning, in which she said that remarks linking “late-term abortions” to a bill to protect leave pay for parents of stillborn children were “insensitive”. Antic used his 90-second statement to defend his colleagues, Andrew Hastie, Barnaby Joyce, Henry Pike and Tony Pasin. The South Australian senator had moved an amendment to the bill in the Senate, which was defeated. Antic directly called out Ley: How can it be insensitive to raise the issue of a clear loophole in a federally mandated scheme in a parliament which votes on the scheme? That is their right, and my right, and that is the very purpose of debate in this parliament. WA premier gives qualified support to federal environment law reforms The Western Australian premier, Roger Cook, has given his conditional support for the Albanese government’s revised nature laws as he backs Murray Watt’s aim to pass them before Christmas. Cook campaigned against federal Labor’s first attempt to reform the EPBC Act, joining forces with the state’s powerful mining lobby to pressure Anthony Albanese to sink the so-called Nature Positive Plan ahead of the May election. The WA premier – who was preparing for his own state election at the time of that campaign – has adopted a far more conciliatory approach with the latest iteration. In Canberra as part of a separate parochial fight to protect the state’s lucrative GST deal, Cook indicated he shared the mining industry’s concerns with a proposed new definition of “unacceptable impact” on the environment that, if met, would result in a project being immediately refused. But Cook said he was confident the issue could be “overcome”, suggesting he believed Watt was open to revising the definition. The premier said the WA government “had a little way to go before we’re in a position to endorse every aspect of [the bill]” but was adamant the bill should pass – and quickly. We need the Greens and the Liberals to basically get on board. We can do this. We can produce legislation which both encourages industry and protects the environment, and I think it’s now is the time for the parliament to act. Question time ends After a final dixer to the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, question time is over for another day. Just one to go for the fortnight! Independent Dai Le asks about bulk-billing changes for mental health consultations Back to the crossbench: Dai Le, who represents the western Sydney seat of Fowler, asks the government about concerns by GPs that the latest changes to Medicare bulk-billing, cutting Medicare items 2712 and 2713 – which are items for mental health consultations – “removes the flexibility to provide longer meaningful consultations for complex mental health cases.” The Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) has said that it’s also very concerned about these changes. From 1 November, “key MBS mental health items will be scrapped, including item 2712 to review a mental health plan, and item 2713 for a mental health consultation longer than 20 minutes. Generic time-based items will be used for this care instead,” they said. The health minister, Mark Butler, says “as far as I can tell” every GP practice in Fowler will be bulk-billing under the new funding changes. Le stands up on a point of order, to call on the minister to directly address the mental health items. Milton Dick says it’s too early to say whether Butler is being relevant and tells him to continue. Butler says: The College of GPs, increasingly they say the number-one issue that GPs are consulted about, about 70% of GPs report the number-one issue they consult about is mental health … the affordability of access to GPs is more important for mental health support than probably any other condition we can think of. I am surprised, frankly, that the member would minimise the impact of the record investment rolled out on Saturday for the access and affordability of mental health support and GPs. That was one of the overriding priorities when we designed the system that we rolled out on Saturday. Albanese asked again about MP’s claim electricity prices will drop The opposition have another go of trying to get Anthony Albanese to confirm whether energy prices will drop by 20% as Luke Gosling said in an interview on Sky News, this time asked by Nationals MP Anne Webster. This time Albanese doesn’t take us down a long tangent, but whips his phone out and quotes from the Climate Change Authority’s advice to the government on the 2035 targets: Expert analysis by the Australian energy market commission predicts residential electricity prices will fall by 13%, about 5c per kilowatt hour. Average household energy costs will fall by about 20%, around $1,000 a year over the next decade under a coordinated renewables rollout. That is the direct quote. Dan Tehan stands up to make a point of order, but Milton Dick doesn’t even hear it and tells him to sit down. Albanese says Gosling was quoting that CCA report. Katter asks agriculture minister about invasive weeds Speaking of journeys, Bob Katter gets the next crossbench question, but he’s very serious today. He asks the agriculture minister, Julie Collins, about what the government is doing about the prickly acacia and buffel grass, which he says the cattle industry is being overrun by. Collins says the government will work with the states and territories. Any future decisions on weed priorities including decisions on this one would be made collaboratively by all state and territory governments along with the commonwealth because as the member would be aware and territories are responsible for the management of pests … in their jurisdictions. Albanese answers question about energy bills … kind of Staying on energy, Liberal MP Simon Kennedy asks the PM if the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling’s “promise” on Sky News yesterday that there will be a 20% decrease in energy bills, is Labor policy. Albanese goes on a real tangent in his answer – it’s quite the journey (and doesn’t really answer the question). He starts by saying that no non-Coalition members go on Sky News (cue some chuckles) and then tries to quote previous work by Kennedy on net zero while he worked at McKinsey (which Albanese also did yesterday). Before he can get to those comments there’s a point of order, which is quickly shut down by Milton Dick. Albanese then praises Sky News host Kieran Gilbert (who hosted the panel that Gosling and Kennedy were on), then talks about Gilbert coming to Apec, and then just talks about Apec. Albanese then circles back to Kennedy’s net zero work at McKinsey, and says it’s the “hunger games” in the Coalition party room (a journey right?!) I recommend to the member for Cook, if I can give him some advice, back in the former member for Cook [Scott Morrison]’s policy of net zero by 2050. Bowen defends solar sharer program Michael McCormack throws a question next to Chris Bowen on the government’s solar sharer program. He cites energy analyst Saul Kavonic, who describes the program as a “thought bubble”. Bowen says McCormack “could have found a better expert”, as Kavonic has made several videos critical of Bowen and supporting an independent candidate in the minister’s seat of McMahon. “That’s how impartial he is,” Bowen says. Bowen cites a bunch of other expert groups like Tim Buckley, the CEO of Clean Energy Finance who called the program “excellent”. The shadow attorney general, Andrew Wallace, stands up next and also asks about data released by Foodbank, which found nearly 200,000 Queensland families went an entire day without eating in the past year. Anthony Albanese says it’s “somewhat perplexing” that the opposition is asking about a report by Foodbank, when the former Coalition government cut their funding. How in tactics committee when someone came up with the question of let’s ask about Foodbank, [someone] did not go: ‘Actually, what might be a little uncomfortable is the fact we ripped out $20m per year out of funding for Foodbank.’ Sussan Ley tries to make a point of order as Albanese keeps slamming the opposition, but she’s shut down by Milton Dick. Chalmers asked about tax incentives for food bank donations Over to the crossbench, the member for Bradfield, Nicolette Boele, asks the treasurer if he will legislate a national food donation tax incentive proposed by Foodbank that would “make it cheaper for food producers to donate excess food to those in need, reduce food waste and save taxpayer dollars”. Jim Chalmers, who always takes an opportunity to have a dig at the Coalition, congratulates Boele for her “comprehensive victory” over the Liberal party in Bradfield. Chalmers gives Foodbank a shoutout but doesn’t commit to a tax incentive. He says similar ideas have been previously canvassed and considered, including by a Senate inquiry. We also know there is more than one way to help wonderful organisations doing the right thing by people in our local communities. This government is providing additional $20m each year to help food and emergency relief organisations. You might laugh at me posing this question, but the issue in front of the speaker at the moment is a complaint from the opposition that Jim Chalmers was unparliamentary in calling the shadow treasurer a liar. Cue a rather long back and forth … At one point the manager of opposition business, Alex Hawke, points to the PM and says “if lying is in order, this is a liar”. Tony Burke argues back and says that comment was unparliamentary. Milton Dick says that Chalmers didn’t actually direct his comments about “lies” to one person, and asks both Chalmers and Hawke to withdraw their comments. I will … remind everyone that word is fraught with danger. Please don’t use it. Chalmers accuses opposition of telling ‘egregious lies’ about government spending Next up the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, asks the prime minister if he will take responsibility for Jim Chalmers’ “spending spree”. Chalmers gets up to answer the question (which was directed to the PM). “Clearly not” says O’Brien, who then gets a warning by the Speaker, Milton Dick, for continuing to interrupt after asking the question. Chalmers starts with a dig, and says, “I’m pleased that the member for Fairfax has taken a brief break from undermining his own leader.” He then accuses the opposition of making “egregious lies” about government spending. Government spending was not mentioned by the Reserve Bank governor yesterday, it wasn’t mentioned in the board statement. And the only mention – the only mention in the detailed forecast which were released which were [to] downgrade their assumptions about government spending going forward. From time to time, reluctantly, it is on us to point out the egregious lies being told by those opposite about our economy. We’re getting straight into it today. Sussan Ley starts and asks if – following a rates hold yesterday – the prime minister will take responsibility for the millions of Australian households that are struggling to afford food. Followers of the blog will be pretty familiar with the talking points by now – Anthony Albanese says that inflation is half of “what we inherited”, real wages are up and interest rates have dropped three times. Cheaper medicines and cheaper childcare measures also get a mention. We understand that people are under pressure. They would have been under more pressure had they not got an income tax cut that was opposed by those opposite … They would have been under more pressure if inflation still had a six in front of it which is what we inherited. They would have been under more pressure if the more than 1m jobs that have been created on our watch had not have occurred. Everyone’s blabbing to everyone, is a bit of the vibe in the Coalition this week, and Nationals MP Michael McCormack is telling his colleagues to stop backgrounding to journos. The very public fight over net zero, which has stretched to question marks over Sussan Ley’s leadership has been difficult and damaging to the party. McCormack had a bit of a go at his fellow MPs on Sky News a little earlier: Backgrounding journalists and calling your parliamentary Coalition colleagues ‘parasites’ – I’m sorry, I can’t wear that. On Ley’s leadership, McCormack said Ley hasn’t been given “clear air”. You might remember Liberal MP Andrew Hastie said when he quit the frontbench he was doing so to give Ley some clear air. She hasn’t had any clear air in the five or six months she’s been leader, she’s the first female leader of the Liberal party in 81 years and the first female opposition leader ever. She needs to be given clear air, given a chance. Abortion remarks ‘unedifying’ and ‘unnecessary distraction’, Hume says Earlier on Sky News today Jane Hume also weighed in on the four Liberal MPs who tied legislation to protect paid leave for the parents of a stillborn baby to late-term abortions. Hume said she respects other views but, “let’s not use important legislation as a vehicle for personal crusades.” I think that there was a bit of horror from many of the women in our party … this is a very serious and deeply personal issue. I thought it was an unnecessary distraction and perhaps a bit of an error of judgment. I respect their views, they’re not my views, and I don’t think it was a particularly edifying moment for us. Hume wouldn’t be drawn on whether the comments would impact Andrew Hastie’s leadership ambitions. The government has passed its bill to establish a centre for disease control through the Senate with amendments from the Greens. The Greens secured an amendment to ensure the annual report includes the impact of the climate crisis on Australians’ health and an update preparedness for future pandemics. The CDC’s advisory committee will also include a First Nations person and disabled person with health expertise. The CDC was a post-pandemic election promise by Labor, which will now go back to the house for a final tick. Data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) today reveals that that total government expenditure on public health has fallen. Total expenditure on public health activities was estimated to be $5.4bn in 2023–24, or about $200 per person. In real terms, this represented a 29.5% or $2.3bn decrease from 2022–23. Between 2013-14 and 2018-19, government spending on public health grew at an average annual rate of 2.5%. This was followed by an increase of 25.8% in 2019-20, before accelerating significantly during the early pandemic. Since 2022-23, however, public health spending has been on a downward trend. Public health focuses on prevention, promotion and protection rather than on treatment. Only about 2% of health funding in Australia goes to prevention. Economic and health experts said the government must to dramatically increase public health spending on prevention, in a peer-reviewed commentary published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health. This would boost the economy, reduce healthcare and treatment costs and improve Australians’ wellbeing, the paper said. Nearly 60% of Australians live with chronic disease, one-third of which is preventable. Lead author of the paper, Associate Prof Jaithri Ananthapavan said: As well as direct healthcare costs, these diseases cost the economy because people with chronic illness have more days off from work, have reduced productivity while at work and also leave the workforce prematurely. Shadow minister Melissa McIntosh has downplayed concerns raised by conservative Coalition colleagues about the potential for women to seek late-term abortions in order to access paid parental leave, saying “I’ve never heard of a woman doing that”. McIntosh, the shadow minister for women, was asked about comments from Andrew Hastie, Barnaby Joyce and others during the debate on Priya’s Law, which would guarantee paid parental leave for mothers who lose their baby. Numerous conservative Coalition MPs and senators had raised concerns about the law’s interaction with abortions, with Tony Pasin saying he was concerned the bill would “treat an intentionally late-term aborted child in the same way as it would a natural stillbirth or a baby who dies shortly after birth”. Earlier today, opposition leader Sussan Ley called commentary linking stillborn bill to late-term abortions “insensitive”; Jane Hume called it “unedifying”, adding “I think that there was a bit of horror from many of the women in our party”. McIntosh defended the right of MPs to raise concerns about conscience issues, though welcomed the passage of Priya’s Law. I think about the families, and we’ve all got friends and families who’ve lost children so late, and I can imagine how much it stirs emotional turmoil in people. So that was their decision. And I hope we can move on from that. And I hope that bill that did go through does help some of those Australian families that are going through so much. Pressed on the issue raised by Hastie, Joyce and others, McIntosh added: “I’ve never heard of a woman doing that. I don’t know, you as reporters, have you ever come across a story where a woman has done that?” I know that Andrew Hastie is a man of faith, so that’s their position, but that bill did go through, and I hope it does bring some comfort to families that would be very traumatised. Liberal senator says ‘no challenge on’ against Sussan Ley as net zero emissions debate continues Jonno Duniam has backed his leader as the public and private debate over the Liberal party’s energy policy and future leadership prospects continue. Speaking to Sky News, the conservative senator says it’s been a “difficult time” for the party. There is no challenge on, and Sussan Ley has, I think, led this debate very well … Sussan has been very constructive and conciliatory about this, and managed to enable us to have our say in a robust way. On the net zero issue, Duniam says there will be an “element” of the National’s policy to tie emissions reduction in Australia to OECD nations. Asked about whether the party should keep a commitment to net zero by the end of the century, Duniam says: I think that what has happened in this debate is there’s been a lot of wrapping ourselves up in or tying ourselves up in knots about a particular element of this. They talk about doing what our neighbours do, or at least the OECD equivalents do, in terms of emissions reductions. There will be an element of that in our policy, how it’s framed up. I’ll allow Dan Tehan, when this process is concluded, along with Sussan Ley, to speak about [it]. Greens to lead Senate inquiry into capital gains tax discount The Greens will lead a Senate select committee inquiry into the capital gains tax discount, after a successful motion by senator Nick McKim on Tuesday. The investor tax break, introduced in 1999, delivers a 50% tax discount on the capital gains made from selling an asset which had been held for longer than 12 months. The CGT, in conjunction with negative gearing rules, has been blamed for fuelling rampant speculation on housing which has contributed to soaring home prices and today’s affordability crisis. Like a similar inquiry into the stage 3 tax cuts before they were remodelled, the Greens inquiry will also highlight the inequity of tax rules that disproportionately benefits wealthier Australians. Parliamentary Budget Office analysis commissioned by the progressive party shows that 65% of the forgone revenue from the CGT discount in 2024-25 went to the top 5% of earners. In comparison, 36% of the benefits from the original stage 3 tax cuts – which were judged to be too favourable to the rich – would have gone to the top 5% of earners. The committee is due to report back on 17 March. The teal independents will oppose Labor’s rewrite of environment protection laws when the bill is put to a vote in the lower house in coming days. Zali Steggall, Sophie Scamps, Kate Chaney, Nicolette Boele, Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender confirmed they could not support the almost 1,500-page bill without major amendments to better protect nature. Chaney, the MP for Curtin, told reporters in Parliament House: My community really wants to see reform in this area. We need to do better at protecting nature and also making processes work faster for business. But when it comes to this package, the process sucks and the substance is questionable. Chaney and the fellow crossbenchers have drafted a raft of amendments, including to redesign the proposed “offsets” fund, prevent the minister from using a new “national interest” exemption to approve fossil fuel projects and insert climate as an object of the act. The bill includes a requirement for high polluting projects to disclose their emissions as part of the application process but does include not a “climate trigger” that could block their approval. Boele said the climate crisis was “turbocharging Australia’s extinction crisis”. How can we expect to help the glossy black cockatoos, our wonderful tall forests, or even our wonderful and diverse reefs, if we’re not dealing with the threats that they face? Scamps – who will move an amendment to remove an exemption for native forest logging – said the laws were riddled with “enormous loopholes”. We’ve got one set of environment laws to protect our nature, and they have utterly failed us for the last 25 years, we now have 19 ecosystems on the brink of collapse, but the changes that the government has proposed do not guarantee that our nature will be better protected. Sydney peace prize ‘disappointed’ Wong declined meeting with laureate The Sydney peace prize has said it’s “disappointed” foreign minister Penny Wong would not meet with former UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, the prize laureate who addressed the National Press Club on Tuesday. Pillay was the first non-white judge in South Africa’s high court, served as a judge of the international criminal court, and is a former chair of the UN’s Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Territory of Palestine and Israel. Director of the Sydney peace prize, Melanie Morrison, told Guardian Australia they had reached out to Wong’s office in August to arrange a meeting. They said that after several follow ups, Wong’s office said the minister was unavailable. Morrison said: As a matter of course, given the calibre of this years’ laureate, it’s disappointing the meeting was declined by the foreign minister’s office. Instead, Pillay met with the assistant foreign minister, Matt Thistlethwaite, the government confirmed, with an adviser from Wong’s office present. Morrison said Pillay also had a meeting with the department of foreign affairs and the ambassador for gender equality on Monday. Opposition accuses Labor of ‘rushing’ nature legislation Liberal MP Julian Leeser is now responding to the prime minister on the nature laws. He said: This bill doesn’t make small changes or amendments. It’s almost 1,500 pages of legislation and explanatory materials that reaches into every corner of the economy that builds, digs, grows and manufactures. He accused the government of rushing the bill, saying “the Senate has already had to step in and refer it to an inquiry”. He continued: This matters because rushing this legislation will have real consequences for Australians. Minister Plibersek attempted to make these reforms in the last parliament, they were withdrawn under internal pressure. Labor promised an Environment Protection Agency at two elections, and four years on, it hasn’t delivered what it promised. Staying with Albanese for a moment, who is speaking now about the nature laws in the lower house. He said a littler earlier: This bill is about driving better, clearer and speedier decision making, making it easier to get an answer from government sooner, a quicker yes or a quicker no. Providing that certainty is the key to encourage investment in our economy. And every bit as important as encouraging investment in our economy is ensuring there’s a better system of protections for Australia’s precious and unique natural environment. He later said: They can talk about the problem, or they can vote for the solution. That is the choice that will be before the senate. I say this to the opposition and to the Greens political party. This is good for jobs, good for industry, but it’s also good for the environment. Anthony Albanese is speaking in the lower house now about the proposed nature laws. The prime minister said: Australia doesn’t have to choose between a strong economy or a healthy environment. We don’t have to choose between creating jobs and cutting emissions. We can do both. Indeed, we must do both, because each one depends on the other. The current laws are broken. They were written by the Howard government for a very different Australia, and they haven’t just become obsolete. They’ve become an obstacle. They’re not working for the environment and they’re not delivering for business. They are a barrier to jobs and investment across our nation, and in many cases, they overlap or duplicate state and local government processes. Here’s a video of federal communications minister, Anika Wells, talking about the under-16s social media ban a short time ago. Could Roblox be added to the social media ban for under 16s? Jumping back to that press conference with Anika Wells and eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant, while Roblox has not yet been added to the list of banned platforms, Inman Grant said it’s “on the line”. As we brought to you earlier, the eSafety commissioner said the list of platforms is “dynamic” while Wells said this morning the legislation isn’t “set and forget”. Inman Grant also brought up a few elements of the Roblox platform that are of concern to her. [The list] will always change and we’ve told companies, so for instance Roblox, as was just mentioned, some of these companies when we did the assessment were very much, what I would say, on the line. So we had to put our minds to what is the sole and significant purpose – online gaming, right? But there’s chat functionality in the US, they’ve launched a program called Moments, which is very much like stories, which is online social interaction. We will be watching as well and if they start rolling out features that look more like they’re becoming a social media company than an online gaming company, then we will seek to capture them. Cook defends WA’s GST take WA, which has declared itself as having the strongest economy in the nation, also gets a phenomenally generous take of the GST carve-up between states and territories. Economists such as Saul Eslake have been advocating to change the Morrison-era deal that put a floor under WA’s GST take and will give the state an extra $60bn in tax revenue over the next decade. Roger Cook tells ABC RN Breakfast that while his state only represents 11% of the nation, it contributes 45% of the nation’s exports, and is the “biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP.” Prior to the actual deal that was done to preserve our 75% floor of the GST share, we saw Western Australia’s contribution to the other states reach almost 90%. That is, we just retained 11% of our GST. Now in WA we utilise that revenue to ensure that we can develop the economic infrastructure, create the sort of frameworks and the regulation for the industry which ultimately pays significant resources to the commonwealth and other states through company tax and other measures. Host Sally Sara pushes back, saying Eslake argues that private industry provides a lot of that infrastructure, but Cook says the state government provides the roads, water and port infrastructure. WA premier says Coalition ‘failing the big moral challenge of our time’ Western Australian premier Roger Cook is in town this week as the government tries to gain support for its environment protection reforms (that political followers will know the WA government was not a fan of last time around). It’s part of the reason why Murray Watt made WA his first visit as a newly sworn in environment minister to get the state on side. Cook spoke to ABC RN Breakfast a little earlier this morning and said he “commend[s]” Watt’s work. I believe we can do this. We have obviously met with environmental groups and with our big resource companies and other members of our industry in Western Australia all the time. They’re encouraged by the progress that’s been made. Obviously, there’s still elements of the legislation that they want to see addressed, but I think there’s a great sense of consensus and collaboration at the moment to see if we can find that space, which creates the balance, the balance between encouraging industry but also protecting the environment. Asked to weigh in on the other big issue of the week – net zero – Cook says the Coalition are “failing the big moral challenge of our time”, and would be “very concerned” if the Libs go down the same path as the Nats on scrapping net zero altogether. They’re quite frankly just starting to retreat to the extremes of the political spectrum. They need to come back to the centre … And I think we should all get round the joint and global consensus position of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. FoI bill returns to house for debate after government ‘sees the light’, says Coalition After the opposition kicked up a stink yesterday on the government’s attempt to move the controversial freedom of information bill to the smaller federation chamber, the government has brought back the debate to the house. Talk about a procedure-heavy day today! The chief opposition whip, Aaron Violi, who yesterday tried to table a list of 16 opposition speakers who were going to miss out on being able to debate the bill in the house, is the first to speak today (his tabling request was rejected FYI). It’s nice that this bill has returned to the house today, the manager of business [Tony Burke] saw this light. Independent MP Zali Steggall, who has been a staunch critic of the bill, is also speaking on it. This bill was drafted without consultation, introduced without transparency, and designed in a way that rewards secrecy. At a time when public trust in government is already low, this legislation seeks to make it harder for Australians to access information and easier for government to hide it. This is not reform, this is regression. The government and Coalition (though many of them abstained) voted against David Pocock’s amendment to the motion to force the government to provide the government board appointments report by 24 November. Labor and the Coalition then voted together on the government’s motion that the extra-long question time end and the matter of the report be considered “satisfactorily complied with” by providing a private briefing to the finance and public administration committee and hand over the report. That motion was voted on with an amendment by the opposition that the report be handed over by 31 December. So there will be a normal time question time in the Senate again today – but if the government doesn’t hand in that report by New Year’s Eve, we could see those extra questions added back in the new year. eSafety commissioners working with Silicon Valley to combat workarounds to avoid age-verification detection Wells has been upfront that this isn’t a catch-all, impenetrable wall that will end all access for under-16s to social media. But Inman Grant says they are working with the platforms to combat potential workarounds such as VPNs and the use of AI to avoid age-verification detection. The eSafety commissioner says she has gone to Silicon Valley and spoken to all the platforms and they’ve given her some reassurances. We have extensive requirements we place back on the platforms themselves to prevent circumvention so location-based circumvention in terms of the use of VPNs. We know generative AI, a mask or graphics from platforms can be used to spoof AI or age-verification systems and we’ve given them very specific specifications as to how we think they should tackle and they’ve given us comfort that this is something that they can do and what they will do in these cases. The communications minister, Anika Wells, and eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, are talking to reporters in Parliament House this morning, following the addition of Reddit and Kick to the social media ban for under 16s. But what about a platform such as Roblox, Inman Grant is asked, which has had serious concerns raised against it, including by the AFP commissioner Krissy Barrett who said platforms like it are being used by “sadistic men” to target young girls. Inman Grant says eSafety deals with “sadistic sextortion and financial sexual extortion on a daily basis”, and that the list of banned platforms is fluid. It’s of great concern to us. We’ve got codes and standards and we’ve used this in our negotiations with Roblox so based on that negotiation by the end of this year, Roblox will roll out age-assurance technologies here. Their primary user base are five-to-13-year-olds but it’s a commingled platform. They know there are adults. So we asked them to take other specific steps including not allowing adults to contact children without specific parental consent and putting on privacy at the highest default. This is a dynamic list and … it will always change. The long Senate question time looks to be over (for now) The government is trying to end the extra question time questions in the Senate, and while it claims the government board appointments report is still before cabinet (so can’t be released yet), the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, says she’ll give the finance and public administration committee a briefing on the report “in camera” (ie in private). The motion states that the Senate resolves the order for the production of a document into the jobs for mates report “has been satisfactorily complied with” and end those extra questions. Gallagher says: I am hopeful that this offer of a briefing finds that interim step before we are in a position to release that document once cabinet has finished considering it we would expect that to be … before the end of this year. The shadow home affairs minister, Jonno Duniam, moves an amendment to Gallagher’s motion, which – if the government does not satisfactorily keep its promise of the briefing and providing that report by 31 December 2025 – would resume the extra questions and makes public service minister attend Senate every sitting morning to explain the failure to comply. We want that document tabled and in order to ensure it is provided as the government has promised it would. The Greens are not happy and are basically calling it a stitch-up between the major parties. The senator who started it all, David Pocock tries to amend the hand-in date for that report to the Monday of the final sitting week, 24 November, to stop the government “burying it” and releasing it on Christmas Eve, and says he has serious concerns about the motion, and the amendment. There’s a growing number of people concerned about what is promised by major parties in opposition and what is deliverd in government, and I think transparency is one of the issues that cuts to the core of it. Today’s motion, I think, is a concern. Ted O’Brien is trying to make ‘Jimflation’ happen Liberal deputy leader and shadow treasurer Ted O’Brien has been prosecuting Labor’s spending and accusing federal treasurer Jim Chalmers of going on a “spending spree” with the budget. On Sky News earlier this morning, he said again that spending is leading to the higher inflation rate seen last week, which was followed by the Reserve Bank’s decision yesterday to keep interest rates on hold. O’Brien’s also been trying to call it the “Jimflation” effect. We’ve heard from the [RBA] governor yesterday, and she made it very clear that if you look even into next year, a headline inflation will peak around 3.7% now what’s the RBA aiming for? What do they want, 2.5%, it’s going to peak at 3.7% next year. This is the problem, it’s all about inflation, it’s all about Jim Chalmers, it’s all about the Jimflation effect. O’Brien says the government needs to introduce quantifiable fiscal rules to limit budget spending and reduce reliance on personal income tax. Word in the corridor has it the O’Brien team has even created “Jimflation” stickers. Paterson says debate on stillborn bill should be ‘measured’ and ‘respectful’ Jumping back to James Paterson’s interview on RN Breakfast, the senator was also asked about the comments by conservative Liberal MPs linking a bill to enforce parental leave payments for parents of a stillborn baby with late-term abortions. Paterson, who is a conservative, says his party supported the bill and while Andrew Hastie and others “raised questions” about the bill, they didn’t vote against it or move amendments. He says people should be allowed to raise questions, but debate should conducted in a way that is “measured, that is calm, that is respectful, that understands the sensitivities that exist.” Conscience issues relating to life and death are some of the most difficult issues that parliaments have to deal with. I think we want to live in a country where people can respectfully raise questions like that … If you read Andrew Hastie’s speech, I think it is a measured, calm, and respectful speech. He asks a question about a potential unintended consequence of the bill, but he does so in a way that’s mindful of the genuine and heartfelt feelings that many people have. Liberals to decide on net zero and climate position in next fortnight Sussan Ley says she will convene the Liberal party in the next fortnight to finally decide on a net zero and climate position, after weeks of uncertainty over their position and pressure from the Nationals and right-wing Liberals to dump the 2050 target. Speaking on Channel Seven’s Sunrise this morning, Ley said: The Liberal party room will meet sooner rather than later, certainly before Parliament resumes after this week and we will come to a position. Parliament rises at the end of Thursday and will return on 24 November, meaning Ley has indicated a policy position within the next two weeks. Ley said her party “will come to its own decision in our own party room exactly as I said we would”, and said she is “listening to my colleagues”. Many Liberal MPs expect the final position to be a dumping or significant watering-down of the Coalition’s current net zero by 2050 commitment - but Ley would also likely face strong questioning and disappointment from moderate MPs, who supported her in the leadership ballot, if she were to cave in to the right-wing of her party. Asked about whether the Coalition could stay together, Ley said: Liberal and National parties are stronger together as a Coalition because we both equally want to fight this awful Labor government. Paterson’s ‘very, very strong preference’ is for Coalition to remain James Paterson, shadow finance minister and a senior member of the Liberals’ leadership group, says the Libs and the Nats should stay together. Speaking to ABC RN Breakfast a little earlier, Paterson said the party should try to avoid the fate of 1987 when the Coalition last split. But, he says, that’s not to say the Coalition should stick together if under all circumstances. It’s self-evidently a true statement that if the Liberal party and National party views are completely irreconcilable, then we couldn’t be in Coalition. But it is my very, very strong preference that we remain in Coalition because we cannot form a government without being in Coalition with the National party … When Liberal and National parties do not run in Coalition, the 1987 election is not widely remembered as a great success for either the Liberal or National parties, and we should all be determined to ensure that doesn’t happen again. Asked about Sussan Ley’s leadership prospects, and her confidence that she’ll remain leader until the end of the year, Paterson says her confidence is warranted and he “strongly supports” her leadership. Police charge twelve people after Sydney defence expo protest Twelve people have been charged after an allegedly violent confrontation between New South Wales police and protesters outside a state government-sponsored defence conference in Sydney yesterday. Police officers and protesters were allegedly injured after both claimed they were “set upon” at Palestine Action Group’s demonstration outside the Indo Pacific International Maritime Exposition in Darling Harbour, amid criticism that Israel’s largest weapons companies were attending the event. In a statement, NSW police said they arrested 15 people during the protest, two of whom were later released without charge. A 33-year-old man has also been released without charge, pending further inquiries. The 12 people charged include: A 27-year-old man charged with refusing or failing to comply with direction and assaulting a police officer without actual bodily harm. He was refused bail to appear before court today. A 26-year-old woman charged with four counts of assaulting police. She was refused bail to appear before court today. A 26-year-old man charged with hindering or resisting a police officer and refusing or failing to comply with direction. He was granted conditional bail to appear before Downing centre local court on 3 December. A 28-year-old man charged with assaulting a police officer without actual bodily harm. He was granted conditional bail to appear before court on 11 December. Four people charged with refusing or failing to comply with direction, who were granted conditional bail before hearings in December. Two men aged 23 and 34, and a 32-year-old woman were charged with hindering police and were granted conditional bail before hearings on 11 November. A 33-year-old man was charged with using offensive language near a public place. He was granted conditional bail before a hearing on 11 December. Ley digs in on argument that she’s never supported ‘net zero at any cost’ Sussan Ley is continuing her media rounds this morning, speaking to ABC News Breakfast, defending the separate policy processes between the Liberals and Nationals. The Liberal leader digs in on her argument that she’s never supported “net zero at any cost” when asked whether she’s prepared to dump the target to save her leadership. There are a lot of different opinions in our party room. I said I wouldn’t make captains calls. I’m doing exactly what I said I would do. And actually, the process has been good. Can I tell you? It’s allowed us to come together, it’s allowed us to talk not just to each other, but to industry and experts. Host, James Glenday, retorts saying Coalition members have also been talking to journalists about how split the parties are. Ley says “that’s ok”. Colleagues are talking about their passionate views on this subject, as they should, and if they talk to journalists, that’s okay, because they’re expressing their passionately held views. Now, journalists can draw the conclusions they want about the things that you’ve described, but it is really important that we do get this right. ‘More room for movement’ ahead of social media ban The government has announced two new platforms being added to the social media ban for under-16s including Reddit and Kick. But there are other platforms, like Roblox, which has previously sparked concerns over children on the platform accessing inappropriate content – that have not been included in the ban. On ABC News Breakfast, communications minister Anika Wells says the legislation is not “set and forget” and more platforms could be added to the ban ahead of the start date. With respect to the list, I know, for example, Twitch is still currently being assessed by the Safety Commissioner, so there will still be room for movement as we move into 10 December. You might remember last week when conservatives including Andrew Hastie, Barnaby Joyce, Henry Pike and Tony Pasin argued in the federation chamber that Priya’s bill – which gives parents who have experienced stillbirth, entitlement to their parental leave payments – could be used by women who have had a late term abortion. Medical experts have been highly critical of the arguments, and accused the MPs of “playing politics”. Ley took a swipe at the MPs and said the bill – which passed with bipartisan support – is “really important” and that women who have lost a baby through tragic events should be supported. Losing a baby is one of the most difficult things that can ever happen to a mother and to a family. And as a mother and a grandmother, this is very personal. Any commentary about this bill applying in other contexts is insensitive. Sabra Lane asks Sussan Ley how confident she is that she’ll still be leader when parliament rises for the year. Rumours are running wild around parliament house, with senior conservatives pushing for net zero to be dumped, and senior moderates putting pressure on Ley to keep climate targets. And let’s not forget Andrew Hastie quit the frontbench last month (saying it wasn’t to make a leadership challenge, but it is a step in any future attempt). Ley seems unfazed by the commentary: I’m completely confident and I have a smile on my face as I answer this because I know that the media and commentary does get a little bit excited from time to time. Sussan Ley, under pressure from within her own party, and the Nationals, says the Liberals will reach a position on net zero “soon”. Speaking to ABC AM, Ley says she’s not “commenting on the commentary”. Host Sabra Lane points to Tim Wilson’s language yesterday that the Liberal party is “not the National party lite”, and Andrew Bragg’s comments that Australia can’t be a “pariah state” and drop out of the Paris agreement. You’re asking me to comment on commentary with respect. And as leader, I said there wouldn’t be any captains’ calls and I’d listen to my team, and that’s exactly what I’m doing. Asked if she personally believes in net zero by 2050, Ley says she’s “always said we cannot have net zero at any cost”. Housing minister says 5% home deposit scheme not contributing to property price growth The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, is defending the government’s 5% home deposit scheme, and has said it’s not a main driver of the latest rise in house prices. Sparring with Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie this morning, O’Neil says house price growth has been a problem for 40 years and “we ultimately have to build more homes quickly”. I’ll release some numbers soon which show the government’s changes to the 5% deposit program are not the primary driver of what’s going on in home building … I think it’s not accurate to blame this on a policy that started four weeks ago. McKenzie says the deposit scheme will mean “first time buyers are saddled with more debt”, and also throws some blame to immigration levels (while the Liberals have tried to somewhat tone down their language around immigration – they’re still drawing a link between immigration rates and increasing house prices). Good morning, Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started. It’s going to be another busy sitting day, so let’s get straight into it! Asio chief speaks about China Mike Burgess also made some more off-the-cuff remarks about China in his appearance at the Lowy. Asked about a reported visit to Beijing in 2023 (Burgess would not confirm or deny the trip), Burgess said he spoke regularly with intelligence agencies from hostile countries. Asio has relationships with more than 351 civilian and military intelligence agencies in 124 countries, he said. He said of China: I did not mention China … but how do you know I wasn’t talking about things China did in my remarks? We all spy on each other. But we don’t conduct wholesale intellectual property theft, we don’t interfere in political systems, and we don’t undertake high-harm activity. The Asio chief, Mike Burgess, gave a speech at the Lowy Institute last night in which he warned that there were “at least” three countries whose governments were prepared to carry out political assassinations in Australia. We have the full story here, but Burgess elaborated on his remarks in conversation with Lowy Institute director Michael Fullilove after he had made the speech. The Asio chief agreed his warning carried an “alarming message” but added that Australians needed to be told. He said: I think it’s incredibly important Australians understand we now live in a world where that is possible… Australia is a long way from everywhere, but not from the threat. Questioned on his remarks that there were “at least three countries … willing and capable” of conducting assassinations, Burgess said: The countries I didn’t mention by name, know who I’m talking about … by mentioning them publicly, I’m also putting them on notice that we know some of them are prepared to do this. And we will do our damndest to stop them before it happens. The Greens senator, David Shoebridge, has accused the Albanese government of being “addicted to secrecy” after Guardian Australia learned of at least two other men being quietly deported to Nauru last week. One of the men was a Sudanese national who sources said was detained within Yongah Hill immigration centre, near Perth, while the other was chartered from another centre within the country. When the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, was asked about the deportation yesterday, he said: “If people have had their visas cancelled, we expect them to leave.” Shoebridge, who is the minor party’s immigration spokesperson, said the government had put up a “wall of secrecy” over the deportations. Forcibly removing people to a country they have never been to, with no connection to, with no oversight and in complete secrecy is not how any democracy should be behaving ... A government that thinks it is okay to do this is one that has lost its moral compass. While the Albanese government has put up a wall of secrecy, we are relying on breadcrumbs of information that fall from the Nauru government and civil society. $2bn in public wealth is being poured into this cruel policy, and minister Burke seems hellbent on making sure no one can question him or get the most basic information on what’s occurring. Reports that one of the people sent to Nauru is from Sudan is especially frightening, when we know the Nauruan president has said the end goal is to send people back to the countries they have fled. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with some of the best overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji takes the controls. Asio chief Mike Burgess gave a speech at the Lowy Institute in Sydney last night in which he said there were “at least” three countries whose governments were prepared to carry out assassinations on Australian soil. Asked whether it was too alarming, Burgess said that it was “incredibly important” for Australians to understand the dangers the country faced. The Greens have accused the Albanese government of being “addicted to secrecy” after Guardian Australia learned that at least two more men were deported to Nauru last week without any public statement. Greens senator David Shoebridge said forcibly removing people from Australia under complete secrecy is not how a democracy should behave.","2025-11-05T06:45:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/nov/05/australia-politics-live-nauru-deportations-labor-greens-coalition-anthony-albanese-sussan-ley-nationals-leadership-net-zero-question-time-ntwnfb"
"abortion","In Florida, the future of abortion might come down to men","When Maxwell Frost bounded on stage at a Saturday morning rally in support of Florida abortion rights, the 27-year-old congressman was quick to explain why he had shown up. “I’m so proud to be here as an ally and partner in this fight!” he yelled to the roughly hundred-strong crowd who had gathered in an Orlando church courtyard, clutching handwritten sings with messages like “abortion bans are killing us” and “womb-tang clan ain’t nothing to fuck with”. His biological mother had given him up for adoption, said Frost, who wore a black T-shirt that read “Abortion is Health Care”. “The thing that made it sacred was the fact that she had a choice,” Frost said. “I’ve had enough of people trying to use parts of all of our identities to take away freedoms from other people.” The crowd – mostly women – roared in response. In an election where women’s access to abortion has become a top issue, activists are now rushing to convince men that they also have a stake in the fight – and that, come Tuesday, they should vote accordingly. Although men support abortion rights at similar rates as women, they seem to be far less driven by the issue. Less than half of men identify as “pro-choice”, according to Gallup, and are far more likely to see the economy or immigration as their top issue. One poll of men of color found that, although more than 80% believe abortion should be legal, less than half prioritized candidates who supported abortion rights. “It’s that common misconception that abortion is a woman’s issue,” said Zach Rivera, a 24-year-old activist with Men4Choice, a national group dedicated to energizing men who support abortion rights. Over the last several weeks, Rivera has spent countless hours knocking on doors in Florida neighborhoods in support of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the Florida constitution and overturn the state’s ban on the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy. Nine other states are also set to vote on similar ballot measures on election day, but Amendment 4 may face the steepest odds. In order to pass, the measure must secure 60% of the vote in a state that has veered sharply to the right in recent years and whose state government has repeatedly tried to kneecap the campaign behind the amendment. Recent polling has found that support for measure hovers somewhere in the 50% range: while one poll found that 58% of Florida voters support it, another put it closer to 54%. In the latter poll, 55% of women supported the measure, compared with 53% of men. In an election as tight as Florida’s, nudging more men to vote yes could mean the difference between victory and defeat. As Saturday morning gave way to a humid afternoon punctuated by bursts of rain, Rivera trudged from house to house in a wealthy, blue area of Orlando, dropping off Men4Choice stickers and attempting to talk to voters about Amendment 4. Numerous houses had blue “Harris/Walz” signs in their front lawns – but not a single one had a purple “Yes on 4” sign. Voters were reluctant to talk about it. “I’m friends with everyone,” one woman said. Rivera has had better luck, he said, with phone banking. In one recent conversation, Rivera described urging one reluctant man to think about his future wife and children: what if, 10 years down the line, his wife died because an abortion ban blocked her from accessing medical care? How would he reveal to his kids that he didn’t vote? “The whole point of this movement is to think about future you,” Rivera recalled telling him. The man, Rivera said, decided to vote in favor of Amendment 4. At an early voting site in Tampa, 24-year-old Brandon McCray cited women’s rights as one of his greatest concerns in the 2024 elections. It helped convince him to vote for Harris. “Amendment 4 would just protect a lot of women,” he said. Banning abortion, he said, “is the biggest violation to a human right”. McCray may be a relative anomaly among his peers. Appalled by the triple-punch of Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, the sexual violence exposed by the #MeToo movement in late 2017 and the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, young women have become the most progressive cohort ever measured in US history – but young men have inched towards the right. While 62% of young women now support Harris, 55% of young men back Donald Trump, according to recent New York Times polling. Moreover, young men’s participation in politics is falling, with young women now on track to vote, rally and donate more frequently. For many young women, the trend is so obvious that its unremarkable. “The right-leaning has more traditional values and more traditional values tends to benefit men more than it benefits women,” said Briana Valle, 22. “For obvious reasons, people are always gonna go for what benefits them.” Leila Wotruba, 22, added: “There’s a lot more at stake for women.” As a gay man, Rivera knows that he may appear to not have much at stake in the fight over abortion rights. But Rivera sees the future of the issue, especially in Florida, as a “litmus test” for other rights. “That’s what I tell people: Even if this might not be a personal issue to you overall … you are definitely next,” he said. “They are just waiting until there’s nobody left to defend you.”","2024-11-03T19:00:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/abortion-florida-amendment-4"
"abortion","NSW abortion deserts: just three of 220 public hospitals provide terminations, research finds","Just three of New South Wales’ 220 public hospitals are routinely providing abortions, according to research by the University of Sydney. The research, which maps lack of access to abortion in the state, also reveals that a majority of the state’s cities and towns are “abortion deserts”, meaning the nearest service is more than 160km away. Abortion is basic healthcare that is legal in NSW. Despite the World Health Organization recommending that all public hospitals provide it, uncovering where it is offered, and under what circumstances, is difficult. The only public hospitals openly providing abortion outside of a medical emergency are Broken Hill hospital in the state’s far west; John Hunter hospital in Newcastle on the north coast; and the Royal Women’s Hospital in Sydney. Women elsewhere are left trying to access one of just 13 private providers, which cost a minimum of $775 if you have a Medicare card, and are not easy to find in any directory. Because there may be unadvertised abortion services at other public hospitals, Guardian Australia separately contacted all NSW local health districts to ask which of their hospitals provided abortion and what happens to people seeking abortions in their district if they don’t. None of the health districts replied. The peak body for obstetricians and gynaecologists described the lack of information about abortion access at public hospitals as “completely unacceptable”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email To better understand where women in NSW are most struggling to access abortion, researchers led by the University of Sydney and the data visualisation specialist Ri Liu, mapped access to surgical abortion (a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting) and medication abortion (taking prescribed abortion pills) across the state. They used publicly available directories but noted that not all abortion services were openly advertised or easy to find, providers could change, and that the circumstances under which abortions were provided was not transparent. The project was inspired by US researchers, who first used the term “abortion desert” to describe places 100 miles (160km) or more from the nearest abortion service. For those living in an abortion desert, transport is required. This could mean at least a four-hour round trip by car, possible overnight accommodation and additional travel funds beyond the cost of the abortion itself. “There are a whole lot of service gaps around abortion that people in the general population really don’t know about until they try to access one,” said Dr Anna Noonan, from the university’s school of rural health. “They don’t know that you can’t just go to a public hospital and say, ‘Can I have an abortion,’ or that they would be turned away,” she said. “There is research about where abortion services are, and the experiences of the people who access those services. But what we hardly ever hear is what it is like to not have access to the service at all.” Anne* is one of many in an abortion desert, living in a large regional town in NSW. When she discovered she was pregnant the news came as a surprise. Her hormonal contraception had failed and she was already in her second trimester when the pregnancy was detected. She and her partner had met later in life and both had children from previous relationships. They decided not to have another child. Anne was seen at her local hospital but there were no providers who could perform an abortion at her gestation of pregnancy. To access the procedure, she and her partner had to travel hundreds of kilometres to Sydney, each taking three days of leave from work. The couple paid several thousand dollars for a surgical termination and accommodation costs. “Luckily, we could afford to take the time off work … that time, that flexibility, that money would not be available to a lot of people in that situation,” her partner said. Guardian Australia asked all 15 NSW local health districts which public hospitals under their management offer surgical abortion, under what circumstances abortion is offered (for example, is it only offered if the health of the mother and/or foetus is at risk?), and what happens when a woman is told no abortion service is available (are they referred on, as required by law, and what does an onward referral involve?). None of the LHDs would answer any of the questions asked by Guardian Australia, despite being provided multiple opportunities to do so. Instead, Guardian Australia was referred to NSW Health, which also refused to answer specific questions about the hospitals which offer abortion, and under what circumstances. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, also would not provide this information. “In most cases, medical or surgical abortions can be provided in the community or non-admitted settings,” he said. He did not answer where those settings were or which cases were approved. Prof Kirsten Black, the Sexual Reproductive Health Committee chair for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “It is completely unacceptable that there is no transparent access to information about abortion care” in NSW. She said the only way to ensure that there was equitable access to termination services was to ensure there was public hospital availability across all hospitals in the state. “RANZCOG believes that abortion is essential healthcare,” she said. Dr Madeleine Belfrage, from the University of Sydney’s Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre, said the researchers already knew that the distribution of services for both medication and surgical abortion in NSW disproportionately disadvantaged people who don’t live in Sydney or near the coast but the extent was “shocking”. “Seeing the sheer size and magnitude of abortion deserts across such a vast expanse of NSW shocked our team,” she said. “Perhaps even more shocking was how much the abortion deserts would shrink if all public hospitals provided this care,” Belfrage said. “It led us to question: why on earth are NSW public hospitals, particularly those outside urban centres, not providing this care to their rural communities?” She said it was clear that abortion is still not integrated into mainstream health service provision, despite being legal in all states and territories. “It is both disappointing and not a surprise to hear that LHDs were not able to confirm if, when, and where abortion services are provided within their public hospital networks,” Belfrage said. “As our maps show, in many areas of NSW the lack of local services, particularly by public hospitals, forces people seeking an abortion to travel hundreds of kilometres away. “There is no other public health service we can think of where duty of care to provide a routine procedure is obfuscated in this way, leaving communities in abortion deserts with significant unmet need,” Belfrage said. Last Thursday a report published by Family Planning Australia revealed that women in regional and rural NSW sought medical abortion at more than double the rate of city women. In remote NSW there were 10 medical abortion prescriptions issued for every 1,000 women, the latest available data, from 2022, showed. In major cities there were 4.2 medical abortion prescriptions for every 1,000 women. Guardian Australia previously reported that a small but influential number of medical practitioners who obstruct abortion care or were uninterested in providing it were also leaving women unable to access abortion in many parts of rural NSW. Black said that abortion should be provided like any other health service. “There should be available pathways through all public hospital systems,” she said. “Referral pathways must be transparent and easy to access, both for the public, and general practitioners who need to refer women who require a surgical termination or those who have had a medical abortion who require further care. “The provision of abortion services in public hospitals normalises this care and provides nurses, midwives and doctors with training and experience in termination services.” *Name has been changed for privacy • Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com The Abortion Desert Map was developed by the Access All Areas research collective at the University of Sydney and Ri Liu, an independent data visualisation specialist.

"abortion","Melania Trump says Donald always knew she supported abortion rights","Donald Trump knew Melania Trump supported abortion rights “since the day [they] met”, the former US first lady said on Sunday. “And I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I think I don’t want government in my personal business,” Melania Trump added in an interview with Fox News, during which she elaborated on a political position that left her at odds with the Republican party led by her husband. The Guardian was first to report on Wednesday how Melania Trump’s eagerly anticipated memoir contained a passionate defense of women’s right to control their own bodies – including with respect to abortion access. The book, Melania, is scheduled for release on Tuesday, less than a month before Donald Trump seeks a second presidency in the 5 November election. She reacted to Wednesday’s reporting in the Guardian with a social media statement on Thursday that declared: “Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard.” Melania Trump defended the decision to reveal her abortion-related views so close to her husband’s electoral showdown with Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee. Public polling has long held that most Americans favor access to abortion, and Democrats have translated that support into political victories during Joe Biden’s presidency. But many Republican-led state legislatures have sought to restrict access to abortion, mainly citing conservative religious beliefs, since the US supreme court eliminated federal-level abortion rights in June 2022. “Well, that was not written in the last week or the last month,” Melania Trump said. “That book was written months before, and it was in print months before. “So that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic.” Harris on Sunday appeared on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast and reminded listeners that three US supreme court justice appointed by Trump formed part of the conservative bloc that eliminated the federal abortion rights previously established by the landmark Roe v Wade decision. Trump has previously spoken proudly of those judicial appointees and their decision as it pertained to Roe. Furthermore, the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, which supports Trump, has openly called for the Food and Drug Administration to completely revoke its approval of the abortion medication mifepristone – and the group’s Project 2025 plan has also pushed for the criminal prosecution of people who send abortion pills or tools through the mail. Melania Trump nonetheless insisted that the former US president “lets me be who I am”. “He lets me believe what I believe,” the former first lady remarked. “He lets me be my own person. And he does respect that, and I respect that as I let him be his own person. “He has different beliefs, and he will do what he believes.”","2024-10-07T13:05:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/melania-trump-abortion-pro-choice"
"abortion","Florida officials investigate voters who signed abortion ballot initiative","Florida law enforcement officials are investigating voters who signed a petition to get a closely watched abortion rights measure on the ballot this fall, showing up at the homes of some residents unannounced in what activists say is an effort to intimidate voters. Organizers turned in more than 900,000 signatures in January to get a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution. The deadline to challenge signatures has passed, but a state agency created by DeSantis to investigate voter fraud recently began investigating whether there was fraud in the gathering process. Isaac Menasche, a Fort Myers voter, said he signed a petition months ago when he was approached at a local farmer’s market. He wrote down his name, birthday, address, and scribbled a quick version of his signature. He didn’t think much of it until last week when a law enforcement officer showed up at his door and pulled out a copy of his signature on the petition, asking him to confirm that it was his – which it was. “The experience left me shaken. What troubled me was he had a folder on me containing my personal information – about 10 pages. I saw a copy of my driver’s license and copy of the petition I signed,” Menasche wrote in a Facebook post last week. “It was obvious to me that a significant effort was exerted to determine if indeed I had signed the petition. Troubling that so much resources were devoted to this. I wonder if the same could be said if the petition were for some innocuous issue.” The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has defended the investigation. “They’re doing what they’re supposed to do,” he said at a press conference on Monday, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “It may be that the signature is totally different, and that voter will say, ‘No, I actually did do that.’ Maybe they signed their name. That is absolutely possible. And if that’s what you say, I think that’s probably the end of it.” But the investigation also comes as DeSantis and Florida Republicans have made other aggressive efforts to thwart the amendment, which needs the support of 60% of voters to pass this fall. The Florida agency for health care administration, a state agency, posted a webpage last week attacking the amendment, which DeSantis has denied amounts to electioneering. Civil rights groups sued the state on Thursday over the agency’s messaging around the amendment. The Florida supreme court also allowed a misleading financial impact statement to be printed alongside the amendment on the ballot. Local election officials in Florida are responsible for verifying signatures that are turned in. Groups that sponsor the petitions are responsible for paying for the robust process, which requires verifying the voter’s signature with the one on file for registration purposes as well as their name, address and date of birth, said Lori Edwards, the supervisor of elections in Polk county (Edwards said the state had not requested any information from her office on the abortion amendment). The office of election crimes and security, a multimillion-dollar effort and first-of-its kind agency created by DeSantis to investigate voter fraud, said earlier this year that it had been “inundated with an alarming amount of fraud related to constitutional initiative petitions”. A spokesperson for Mary Jane Arrington, the supervisor of elections in Osceola county in central Florida told the Associated Press that her office had never received a request to review signatures that had already been validated in the 16 years she had been in her role. Florida Democrats and voting groups have ripped DeSantis for the investigation, saying it is an obvious effort to intimidate voters. “This is all about theater, this is all about intimidation of the voters as people are about to go to the ballot box,” Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic party, said at a press conference on Monday. The Florida department of state told the Florida department of law enforcement in a letter earlier this summer it had opened an investigation into more than 40 people paid to circulate the abortion-focused petitions. The letter also says the department had obtained “credible information” that several petition circulators in Palm Beach county had submitted fraudulent signatures. The local supervisor of elections had secured some signed complaints from voters saying they did not actually sign petitions, the letter says. “Some of the above-named circulators also signed petitions on behalf of individuals who were deceased at the time the petition was allegedly signed. The circulators appear to have forged the voters’ signatures and inserted the voters’ personal identifiable information into the petitions without consent,” the letter says. The department of state provided copies of petition forms alleged to contain fraud, with the signature and voter information redacted. The agency also released three complaints from voters saying they had not in fact signed the petition. “We have a duty to seek justice for Florida citizens who were victimized by fraud and safeguard the integrity of Florida’s elections. Our office will continue this investigation and make referrals to FDLE as appropriate,” Mark Ard, a spokesperson for the Florida department of state, said in a statement. The campaign behind the amendment, Floridians Protecting Freedom, hired a private company, PCI Consultants, to handle most of the signature gathering. Angelo Paparella, the company’s president, said in an interview that his company reviewed all the signatures it collected before submitting them to local election officials. When they found some that looked fraudulent – a tiny fraction of the more than 1m they collected – they submitted those separately and flagged that they were suspicious. “My staff is pretty good at ferreting this out,” said Paparella, who has been collecting signatures in Florida since 1998. “Sometimes people are idiots and they try to take a shortcut, you know, taking names out of a phone book. It’s a very stupid thing to do. It’s a crime.” Still, he said, the tiny amount of fraud does not come anywhere close to the overwhelming number of valid signatures that were submitted. “If they find someone who committed any kind of forgeries, then prosecute them,” he said. “It takes nothing away from the nearly million valid signatures that the counties found.” It is not clear how many voters have been targeted in the abortion petition investigation, but the Tampa Bay Times reported that at least six counties had been asked to provide information on signatures that had already been approved. One of those counties is Alachua county, where state officials requested to review 6,141 petitions. All of them had been submitted by six circulators that the state believed had submitted fraudulent petitions. In Osceola county, the state requested to review around 1,850 petitions from specific circulators, Arrington’s office said. In Hillsborough county, officials wanted to review nearly 7,000 petitions to the state for review, the supervisor of elections’ office said. The state requested to review 17,000 signatures in Palm Beach county, according to the Tampa Bay Times. In Orange county, home to Orlando, they requested to review 11,500 petitions. The investigation is the latest salvo of the office of election crimes and security, whose mission has been criticized since voter fraud is extremely rare. In 2022, the agency drew scrutiny for arresting people with felony convictions who had voted but appeared to be confused about their eligibility. It has also pursued fines against voter registration groups for relatively minor errors. Many voter registration groups have ceased activity in Florida since. “It’s been clear from day one that the purpose of the election police was to harass voters who don’t have the same viewpoints as the governor,” said Brad Ashwell, the director of the Florida chapter of All Voting is Local, a voting rights group. “By going after a petition for Amendment 4, which is already on the ballot, Governor DeSantis is undermining the will of voters and stomping over their democratic freedoms for his own political gain.”","2024-09-13T09:00:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/florida-abortion-petition-investigation"
"abortion","Texas sues New York doctor accused of mailing abortion pills across state lines","The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has sued a New York doctor over accusations that she mailed abortion pills to a Texas woman in defiance of the state’s ban on the procedure. The lawsuit will test the power of “shield laws”, a post-Roe v Wade strategy designed to protect abortion providers and enable access to pills for women in states that have banned abortion. Filed in Collin county, Texas, and announced on Friday, the lawsuit alleges that Dr Margaret Carpenter sent abortion pills to a 20-year-old Texas woman through telemedicine. After the woman sought medical attention for severe bleeding in July, the “biological father of the unborn child” suspected that she had sought to end her pregnancy without informing him and found the abortion pills, according to the lawsuit. Because Carpenter is based in New York, Paxton’s lawsuit will come up against New York’s shield law, which dictates that officials in the state not cooperate with attempts by other states to sue or prosecute providers who send abortion pills to people in states that ban abortion. Seven other states have passed similar shield laws since the US supreme court overturned Roe. These laws have proven critical to maintaining post-Roe access to abortion. On average, in every month between April and June of 2024, shield laws helped providers send pills to more than 9,700 people who live in states with near-total abortion bans, six-week bans or restrictions on telemedicine abortion, according to #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. This lawsuit will mark the first time shield laws are tested in court, pitting the laws of two states against one another. “This was inevitable,” said Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis, school of law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. “This is going to be a state-to-state conflict.” Ziegler added: “The goal, I think in part, is to intimidate physicians by saying: ‘We’re coming for you personally.’” Mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs that the lawsuit accuses Carpenter of mailing, are commonly utilized in US abortions and are safe and effective when used to end pregnancies in the first trimester. The lawsuit indicates that the woman’s pregnancy ended at around nine weeks, but it is not clear whether she suffered long-term health consequences. The woman’s degree of involvement in the lawsuit is also not clear. Paxton’s office did not immediately return a request for comment. “In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,” Paxton said in a statement. Paxton’s lawsuit is asking for a temporary injunction against Carpenter that would stop her from prescribing abortion pills to Texas residents and from practicing telemedicine in Texas, where Carpenter allegedly does not hold a medical license. The lawsuit also asks that Carpenter be fined $100,000 for each violation of Texas law, as well as cover any attorneys’ fees that Texas incurs. Ziegler said that it is not clear whether New York law would protect Carpenter from having to pay those fines if Paxton prevails. New York law also enables Carpenter to argue that Paxton’s lawsuit constitutes “unlawful interference with protected rights”, meaning she could potentially file a lawsuit of her own. If Texas or Carpenter win money through a lawsuit but their respective state courts refuse to force them to pay, the litigation could end in front of the US supreme court, Ziegler said. Carpenter is a founder and co-medical director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, which works to expand access to shield laws and help doctors navigate them. The organization did not immediately reply to requests for comment. “As other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,” the New York attorney general, Letitia James, said in a statement after news of Paxton’s lawsuit broke. “We will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.” This article was amended on 16 December 2024 to correct a misspelled name.","2024-12-13T21:34:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/texas-abortion-pills-lawsuit-ken-paxton"
"abortion","Why is Ghislaine Maxwell getting the Club Fed treatment?","Ghislaine Maxwell at Club Fed I don’t know what, if anything, keeps Ghislaine Maxwell up at night. But it’s certainly not the prospect of running out of toilet paper in the minimum-security prison where she’s residing. Maxwell is serving a 20-year-sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation. Rather than doing hard time, however, it seems Maxwell is having a relatively easy go of it. While most inmates get an allocation of two rolls of toilet paper per week, for example, CNN reports that Maxwell gets an unlimited supply. Bountiful bog roll isn’t the only privilege being extended to Maxwell. The very fact that she was transferred to the federal prison camp (FPC) in Bryan, Texas, has prompted uproar and claims of special treatment. Maxwell, to jog your memory, was originally held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn, New York, then sent to a Florida facility in 2022, where she complained about poor conditions and “possums falling from the ceiling”. It’s not entirely clear why she was transferred out of the possum prison, but it may have had something to do with a visit paid to her in July by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who was previously Trump’s personal defense attorney. What did the pair talk about? I’m so glad you asked! In the interests of transparency, which the Trump administration is very keen on when it suits them, the chat between Blanche and Maxwell was recorded and released to the public. And, what do you know, Maxwell was emphatic that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way”. She was moved from the Florida facility within days. Ever since the transfer, which a prison consultant called “unprecedented”, there have been reports that Maxwell is being treated like a VIP. Earlier this month, for example, the Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin sent a letter to Trump noting that “the deference and servility to Ms. Maxwell [at FPC Bryan] have reached such preposterous levels that one of the top officials at the facility has complained that he is ‘sick of having to be Maxwell’s bitch’”. Raskin’s letter also claims that “FPC Bryan Warden Hall, has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell since her bizarre arrival at the institution,” including special meals, access to technology, puppies to play with, and special use of the exercise facilities. Emails written by Maxwell that were recently seen by the Atlantic further reinforce the idea that the disgraced socialite is having a relatively comfortable time behind bars. “The food is legions better [than at the facility in Florida], the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite,” Maxwell wrote in one email to her brother reviewed by the Atlantic. “I am much much happier.” Well, good for you, Ghislaine. But the fact that the US seems to have a two-tiered legal system should make everyone else very unhappy indeed. This isn’t really about Maxwell: it’s about who our legal system protects and who it punishes. Maxwell, it cannot be stressed enough, is no victim or unwitting accomplice. She came from a world of power and privilege and used her status to prey on vulnerable young girls. Maxwell hasn’t just been accused of procuring girls for Epstein to abuse; she’s been accused of actively participating in the abuse. In 2021, for example, a woman identified by the pseudonym “Jane” testified in Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial that she’d met the socialite when she was 14. At first Maxwell and Epstein made her feel special. Then, according to Jane, the abuse started, and Maxwell would occasionally join in. The fact that she has been accused of serious crimes isn’t to say that Maxwell should be thrown into a dungeon and left to sustain herself on foraged possum. I strongly believe that all incarcerated people should be held in humane conditions and given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. Alas, that’s far from the case. While Maxwell apparently does pilates and plays with puppies, prisoners without the sort of connections she has are rotting away. This is particularly true of women in the US, who are disproportionately locked up in jails rather than state prisons. According to a 2024 report by the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 60% of women in jails under local control haven’t been convicted of a crime yet and are awaiting trial. This, the Prison Policy Initiative posits, is because “incarcerated women, who have lower incomes than incarcerated men, have an even harder time affording money bail.” Local jails tend to offer fewer services and programs than prisons do and offer more limited communication options; it’s significantly more expensive to call people from jail than prison, for example. The lesson from all this? If you’re going to be a criminal, make sure you’ve got a lot of money and the right connections. Worst case scenario you end up in a plush correctional facility with unlimited toilet paper. Best case scenario, you end up president of the US. South Carolina fails (for now) to advance the most restrictive abortion bill in the US The state currently has a six-week abortion ban with limited exceptions for rape, incest and the mother’s health. That’s not enough for some anti-abortion advocates, who recently advanced a bill that would repeal exceptions for the rape, incest and fetal anomalies and, as ABC News put it, “make abortion a felony comparable to ‘the homicide of a person born alive’”. The bill, which was discussed on Tuesday, also contained language which might be used to ban hormonal birth control and limit in vitro fertilization. While this particular bill has now stalled, expect more efforts to criminalize abortion. Donald Trump told a female reporter: ‘Quiet, piggy’ Trump didn’t just lash out at the Bloomberg reporter. The president also lashed out at another female journalist after she asked Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (sometimes nicknamed Mohammed Bone Saw) about the brutal murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “These incidents are not isolated; they are part of an unmistakable pattern of hostility – often directed at women – that undermines the essential role of a free and independent press,” the Society of Professional Journalists said in a statement Wednesday. As Karen Attiah wrote for the Guardian, “the Saudification of America is under way”. ICE employee arrested in sex-trafficking sting allegedly told police: ‘I’m ICE, boys’ This didn’t turn out to be the get-out-of-jail-free card he clearly hoped it might be. “Well, unfortunately for him, we locked him up,” the police officer in charge said. Rachel Maddow faces backlash for attending Dick Cheney’s funeral The 46th US vice-president championed sweeping surveillance, advocated for the invasion of Iraq and defended “enhanced interrogation” techniques. He has a very bloody legacy and arguably helped pave the way for Trump. So it caused a few raised eyebrows when Rachel Maddow, the most influential host on MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), who has been very critical of Trump, paid her respects at his funeral. Former Obama speechwriter is upset that people are siding with ‘weak’ Palestinians “You have TikTok just smashing young people’s brains all day long with video of carnage in Gaza,” Sarah Hurwitz lamented in a video that has gone viral. Hurwitz added that Holocaust education has backfired because now young people are siding with “weak, skinny Palestinians”. This is a fascinating argument to make considering very little information is still coming out of the ruins of Gaza – which Israel continues to bomb while it displaces record numbers of Palestinians in the West Bank. Foreign journalists are still not allowed unfettered access to Gaza and members of the Israeli parliament recently voted to move forward with a bill that would allow the government to permanently shut down foreign media outlets if deemed a threat to national security. If Israel’s advocates truly believe that the far-right government is being portrayed in the wrong light, then demand independent investigations into alleged war crimes and free access to the press!

"abortion","Factchecking Trump’s debate claims: from abortion to Project 2025","Donald Trump repeatedly made false and misleading claims about immigrants “eating the pets”, his connection to Project 2025 and the Central Park Five, among other topics, during his debate with Kamala Harris on Tuesday in Philadelphia. At the first debate of this presidential election cycle in June – when Joe Biden was still the Democratic party’s nominee – moderators took a completely hands-off approach to factchecking. The light moderation meant that lies and half-truths, most frequently from Trump, went unchallenged during the primetime debate. Here are the facts on some of the false claims offered during Tuesday’s debate. Trump claims crime is up in the US Donald Trump claimed that crime is way up in the US. The facts: Trump is wrong: crime is actually down. Data from the FBI found that violent crime decreased during the Trump administration, spiking in 2020 during the pandemic and continuing to trend downward afterwards. Preliminary data from the FBI found that violent crime was down 6% in 2023, and 15% in the first quarter of 2024. Violent crime decreased throughout most of Trump’s presidency, according to FBI data that uses information provided by law enforcement agencies. However, it spiked in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It has trended downward since 2020 across the US, nearing pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Preliminary FBI data for 2023 shows that violent crime overall was down another 6% that year. Though the data is preliminary, it includes numbers from 80% of the law enforcement agencies in the country. Trump repeats a falsehood about abortion Trump repeated one of his usual falsehoods: that abortions are taking place in the ninth month of pregnancy. The facts: Fewer than 1% of abortions are performed past 21 weeks of pregnancy; when these abortions do take place, they often occur in medical emergencies or cases of fetal anomalies. Trump also suggested, at multiple points, that abortions take place after birth. That would be infanticide, and it is illegal in all 50 states. Trump denies involvement in Project 2025 Trump denied knowledge of Project 2025, a 900-page plan for the aggressive rightwing overhaul of nearly every aspect of the federal government. Project 2025 suggests ridding the federal ranks of many appointed roles and stacking agencies instead with more political appointees aligned with, and more beholden to, Trump’s policy prescriptions. The facts: Though Trump has tried repeatedly to distance himself from the platform, which seeks to strip away reproductive, LGBTQ+ and voting rights, his policies align heavily with Project 2025. As the Guardian’s Rachel Leingang reported: “Trump well knows the Heritage Foundation and has spoken at their events, and [Kevin] Roberts, Heritage’s leader, has previously said he and Trump have talked several times. Project 2025’s authors and supporters contain a ton of former Trump administration officials.” Trump makes false claims about immigration Donald Trump has spouted off a number of false claims about immigration. Among other allegations, he said immigrants are “taking over the towns … They’re going in violently.” The facts: That’s false. Although some US cities have seen an influx of immigrants, most have arrived legally, with work permits or with authorization to stay while their cases are worked out in the courts. There has been no widespread violence in these cities and, overall, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the US-born according to multiple, extensive studies, including from the conservative Cato Institute. Trump claims immigrants are ‘eating the pets’ in Ohio town Trump repeated an unsubstantiated claim that immigrants are eating pets in an Ohio town, forcing the moderator to tell him that there is no proof of that. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats … they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame,” the former president said. The story of migrants allegedly eating pets has circulated in rightwing media in recent days and been repeated by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance. The facts: These are false and unsubstantiated claims. “You bring up Springfield, Ohio, and ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,” moderator David Muir told Trump. The Springfield News-Sun reported on Monday that police have “received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten”. Trump repeats 2020 election misinformation Donald Trump repeated misinformation about the result of lawsuits contesting the 2020 election results. The former president said that “no judges looked at” lawsuits he and allies filed about irregularities in the election. “They said we didn’t have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn’t have standing? The president of the United States doesn’t have standing. That’s how we lost,” Trump said. The facts: That’s misleading. Some lawsuits were dismissed due to a lack of standing – meaning that those who brought the lawsuits didn’t have a stake in the results. Others were decided on merit. Judges found in some cases that evidence provided was speculative, or failed to show fraud. Trump and Harris argue over the ‘best’ or ‘worst’ economy Trump boasted that the US experienced its “best” economy under his administration, while Harris noted that he left the US with “the worst unemployment since the Great Depression”. The facts: They’re both wrong – Trump by a lot, and Harris by a shade. Though unemployment spiked to its worst levels since the Great Depression in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it dipped back by the time Trump left office. Meanwhile, Trump’s “best economy” line has been the bane of fact checkers since he was in office. “Best” is a very vague term – but by several measures, including GDP, unemployment, the trade deficit – the economy was far from its peak. Here are some final numbers from his term, compiled by FactCheck.org: The economy lost 2.7m jobs. The unemployment rate increased by 1.7 percentage points to 6.4%. Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Average weekly earnings for all workers were up 8.4% after inflation. After-tax corporate profits went up and the stock market set new records. The S&amp;P 500 index rose 67.8%. The international trade deficit Trump promised to reduce went up. The US trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 36.3% from 2016. The number of people lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4tn to $21.6tn. Home prices rose 27.5%, and the homeownership rate increased 2.1 percentage points to 65.8%. Trump doubles down on claims about the exonerated Central Park Five Donald Trump doubled down on his claims that the exonerated Central Park Five – Black teenagers who were arrested in connection with the rape and assault of a white female jogger in 1989 and convicted based on police-coerced confessions. Back then, Trump called for the execution of the five children. When Kamala Harris brought up Trump’s stance, he dug in: “They pled guilty … They badly hurt a person, they killed a person, ultimately.” The facts: The five boys were tried as adults and actually pleaded not guilty. And the victim, Trisha Meili, although almost killed, was found unconscious in the park, survived and testified in court. All of them were exonerated after a convicted murderer confessed to the crime in 2002. In 2014, they were awarded a $41m settlement. In 1989, before any of the boys had faced trial, Trump paid a reported $85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city’s newspapers, including the New York Times, calling for their execution. The headline read: “Bring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!” and above his signature Trump wrote: “I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.” • This article was amended on 11 September 2024 to make clear that, contrary to Donald Trump’s claims, the Central Park Five pleaded not guilty at trial, and the victim in the case survived.

"abortion","What is Melania Trump’s game in suddenly defending abortion rights?","When news broke on Wednesday evening that Melania Trump supports abortion rights – and apparently has for her entire adult life – it was greeted with surprise and confusion. Melania’s husband, Donald Trump, is trying to rapidly recalibrate his approach to abortion as he races towards election day. Is his wife trying to help him? Hurt him? Or neither? In her forthcoming memoir, Melania Trump went into extensive detail about her support for the procedure. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?” she wrote. “A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.” Shortly after the Guardian broke the news, Trump uploaded a black-and-white video of herself to social media, set to stirring music. “Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth,” she said. “Individual freedom. What does my body, my choice really mean?” The news of Melania Trump’s support for abortion rights comes at a time when her husband is striving to convince voters that he can be trusted to protect abortion rights. In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, abortion has become Republicans’ achilles heel. It cost Republicans victories in the 2022 midterms, while abortion rights supporters have won a string of ballot measures even in states as red as Kentucky, Kansas and Ohio. Earlier on in his campaign, Trump attempted to be all-things-abortion to everybody, alternately bragging about his role in overturning Roe – by appointing three of the justices who voted for its demise – and grousing that hardline positions on abortion were costing the GOP elections. But since Kamala Harris, an extraordinarily effective messenger on abortion, became the Democratic nominee for president, he has abandoned that approach in favor of garbled support for abortion rights. “WOMEN WILL BE HAPPY, HEALTH, CONFIDENT AND FREE!” Trump recently posted on Truth Social. “YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION, BECAUSE IT IS NOW WHERE IT ALWAYS HAD TO BE, WITH THE STATES.” Melania Trump’s revelation, then, could be intended to reassure undecided voters who are disinclined to vote for Harris but support abortion rights – as a majority of Americans do. But Tresa Undem, a pollster who has surveyed people on abortion for more than two decades, said the odds of such comments appealing to moderates or abortion-supporting conservatives were “fairly slim”. After all, regardless of her personal convictions, it seems unlikely that Melania Trump has any real sway over her tempestuous husband’s policies. Her pro-abortion rights beliefs did not stop Donald Trump from helping to demolish Roe. It also doesn’t help that Melania and Donald Trump’s relationship is, at least in public, far from cozy. (He recently indicated, despite having written the foreword, that he hasn’t read the book.) “Nothing Republicans say will distract the American people from the reality they see with their own eyes: story after story of victims of rape and incest being forced into pregnancy, doctors forced to turn away patients during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies and women literally dying because of Trump’s abortion bans,” Emilia Rowland, Democratic national committee press secretary, said in a text. Melania Trump’s disagreement with her husband is also not as novel as it may seem. Betty Ford, the wife of the Republican president Gerald Ford, was an adamant supporter of abortion rights, said Mary Ziegler, a University of California Davis school of law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. It didn’t end up making much of a difference in Gerald Ford’s campaign. “I think people understand that Melania and Donald Trump are very different people,” Ziegler said. “I could see independent and swing voters saying: ‘Wow. It’s bad that even Donald Trump’s wife doesn’t like Donald Trump’s position.’” What Melania Trump’s news seems to have done is anger the anti-abortion activists who have made up some of Trump’s most reliable supporters. These activists were already annoyed by Trump’s recent attempts to paint himself as an abortion rights champion. “Melania Trump’s support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,” Kristan Hawkins, president of the pro-life organization Students for Life of America, posted on X. “What a lost opportunity to inspire a generation of young women.” Melania Trump’s strategy, such as it is, may be much more straightforward than activists and politicos may think. She has never seemed particularly interested in being first lady, and she doesn’t appear to be invested in winning the job back, seeing as she has largely disappeared from the 2024 campaign trail. But Trump does seem interested in doing at least one thing: selling books. Suggesting that there is controversy within her memoir’s pages probably helps move copies. Or not. In her post, Hawkins added: “I won’t be buying Melania’s book.”","2024-10-03T16:40:24Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/melania-trump-abortion"
"abortion","James Dobson obituary","James Dobson, who has died aged 89, was for many years one of the leading members of the religious right in the US, mobilising the millions of followers of his daily television and radio broadcasts over more than 40 years, invariably to vote on supposedly moral grounds for Republican candidates, even Donald Trump. In the early 2000s Dobson was described by the New York Times as the most influential evangelical leader in the country, able to affect the choice of candidates by judging their ideological soundness, and the series of organisations he founded – primarily Focus on the Family but also the Family Research Council and latterly the Family Policy Alliance – became powerful lobbying bodies at state and national levels. His daily broadcasts were available in a dozen languages on 60 US television stations and to a potential worldwide audience of 220 million people. The message was uncompromisingly conservative, anti-feminist, anti-abortion and anti-gay rights: a fight for what he called a “civil war of values”. Children should be chastised from babyhood to teach them about the wrath of God, women should stay at home, inter-racial marriages and LGBT activists were undermining the family and the US constitution. “The wages of sin is death and children have the right to understand that fact,” he insisted. He told CNN in 2002: “The family was designed for a purpose and if you go tampering with it the whole thing crumbles.” He claimed: “We’re in a moral freefall. Wherever you stick the thermometer into the American culture you’ll find corruption.” Bill Clinton and Barack Obama (“the abortion president”) failed the test, as did John McCain, because he endorsed abortion in some circumstances, and even George W Bush only narrowly passed the test. Despite his three marriages, occasional lewdness and untruthfulness, Trump was eminently supportable: “I really do love and appreciate that man,” Dobson told an interviewer on the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2019, “I wish people would get off his back.” The cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants was teaching children homosexuality; The Da Vinci Code “was cooked up in the fires of Hell”; and Dobson’s followers were warned off the Harry Potter movies for their occasional profanity (“Ron has a habit of saying ‘bloody h***’”) and worse: “It is impossible to invest in a series that glamorises witchcraft.” Yet Dobson was not an ordained hellfire minister but a child psychologist who held a doctorate and had spent 14 years as an associate clinical professor of paediatrics at the University of Southern California medical school and at the Los Angeles children’s hospital. He was born at Shreveport in upstate Louisiana, the son of Myrtle (nee Dillingham) and James Dobson, who was a third-generation itinerant travelling preacher for the fundamentalist Church of the Nazarene, holding services across Oklahoma and Texas. Dobson himself claimed that he made a commitment to Jesus at the age of three. It was the social and liberal changes of the 1960s, and particularly the Watts riots in Los Angeles, that reinforced his views and led to his first book, in 1970, Dare to Discipline, which – against the teachings of Dr Spock – advocated the parents should chastise their children with a paddle or a belt, which could be left within their sight on the dresser in their bedrooms. Dobson himself had been beaten by his mother as a child and he advocated that 18 months was not too young to start the process. He drew the line only saying that those with violent tempers or who enjoyed chastisement should leave punishment to their partners. The book, the first of 70, sold 2m copies. It was followed by screeds with titles such as What Wives Wish Their Husbands Knew About Women (1975) and Parenting Isn’t for Cowards (1987), and a constant message that “Men like to hunt and fish and hike in the wilderness” while women prefer “to stay at home and wait for them”; and “Men derive self-esteem by being respected; women feel worthy when they are loved.” The family as the bedrock of civilisation was undermined if wives went out to work, or by contraception, cohabitation and abortion. Same-sex marriage would lead down a slippery slope to polygamy and worse. Mass shootings such as at Sandy Hook were judgments from God because of abortion and gay marriage. “The LGBTQ movement is closing in on the God-inspired and established institution of the family,” he said in 2019. As a dreadful warning of the perils of pornography, Dobson interviewed the serial killer Ted Bundy a few hours before he was executed in 1989 persuading the man to claim that porn had encouraged him to kill 30 women. Tapes of the interview allegedly raised $1m for Focus on the Family, though some was donated to anti-pornography and anti-abortion groups. The Focus on the Family organisation was founded in 1977 and moved to Colorado Springs in 1988, eventually covering an 80-acre site, employing a staff of 1,300 answering readers and listeners’ questions, sending out tapes, tracts, magazines and videos and having an annual turnover of $140m by 2004. Unlike some televangelists, Dobson himself did not have a particularly lavish lifestyle, not taking a salary but living off book royalties. Republican politicians certainly paid attention, especially after the warning arising from a meeting between the aspirant presidential candidate Phil Gramm and Dobson, in 1995. The Texas senator told him that he would not make his campaign a moral crusade, that he was running for president, not preacher: “I just don’t feel comfortable going round telling other people how to live their lives.” Dobson stalked out saying; “I walked into that meeting fully expecting to support Phil Gramm for president. Now I don’t think I would vote for him if he was the last man standing.” When another candidate claimed his campaign was big enough to accommodate abortion supporters, Dobson sent an eight-page letter to his 2.1 million subscribers, 112,000 clergy, 8,000 politicians and 1,500 journalists telling them that he would “never again cast a vote for a politician who would kill one innocent baby”. Tolerance, he said, was not the greatest good. Dobson was jubilant when the supreme court overturned the right to abortion in 2022. Dobson married Shirley Deere in 1960. She survives him, as do his daughter Danae and son Ryan. • James Clayton Dobson, psychologist, writer and broadcaster, born 21 April 1936; died 21 August 2025","2025-08-26T16:44:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/james-dobson-obituary"
"abortion","‘No room for compromise’: Melania Trump reiterates abortion rights support","Melania Trump doubled down in her first public response to news of her passionate support for abortion rights, a position starkly at odds with that of her husband, Donald Trump, and the Republican party he leads. “Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,” the former first lady said in a video released on Thursday. “Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth. Individual freedom. What does ‘My body, my choice’ really mean?” Set to classical music and posted to social media, Trump’s words were a paraphrase of those in her forthcoming memoir, Melania, which the Guardian revealed on Wednesday. On the page, Trump says: “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” News of that stance created a stir, a little over a month from election day in a campaign shaped by attacks on abortion rights by Donald Trump, the Republican party, and their donors and supporters. In June 2022, in the supreme court case Dobbs v Jackson, three hardline justices appointed by Trump voted to remove the federal right to abortion, marking a successful end to a 50-year crusade by religious conservatives. Draconian state bans followed – as did reports of women dying after being denied abortion care. Trump has claimed credit but also tried to lessen electoral damage, given clear majority support for abortion rights that has fueled a succession of Democratic electoral wins since the Dobbs decision. A spokesperson for the Republican nominee did not respond to a request for comment. Trump himself spoke to Fox News, while staging a rally in Saginaw, Michigan. “We spoke about it,” he said, when asked about his wife expressing support for abortion rights in opposition to his record and platform. “And I said: ‘You have to write what you believe.’ I’m not going to tell her what she should do. You have to write what you believe. She’s very beloved. People love our former first lady, I can tell you that. But I said: ‘You have to stick with your heart.’ I’ve said that to everybody, you have to go with your heart.” Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, said: “Sadly for women across America, Mrs Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom and their lives. “Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: if he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women and restrict women’s access to reproductive healthcare.”","2024-10-04T00:39:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/melania-trump-memoir-abortion"
"abortion","Norfolk man who gave abortion drugs to unknowing woman jailed for 12 years","A “callous” and “selfish” man who gave abortion drugs to a pregnant woman without her knowledge, causing her to lose her unborn baby, has been jailed for 12 years. Stuart Worby, 40, crushed a tablet into orange juice that the woman drank in 2022. The defendant, of Dereham, Norfolk, then gave the victim a number of tablets of another abortion drug after using deception to engage in sexual activity with her while she was blindfolded. The woman, who is entitled to lifelong anonymity by law as the victim of a sexual offence, was 15 weeks pregnant when she miscarried. Edmund Vickers KC, prosecuting, told Norwich crown court it was “quite clear” that the woman “wanted to have the baby”. In a victim impact statement, read to the court by the prosecutor, the woman said she felt she had “failed to protect my baby”. “This pain will never leave me knowing that this baby could have been my only chance to be a mother in this lifetime,” she said. The woman said she had not been able to conceive again and had “gone from fertility clinic to fertility clinic”. “Being a mother was a dream to me,” she told the court. Vickers said Worby’s offence was “deliberate, well-planned and callous” and he was helped to obtain the abortion drugs by his friend’s partner, Nueza Cepeda. He said Worby paid £470 to book an appointment for Cepeda with a gynaecology centre in London. The appointment took place in summer 2022 and a prescription was made for the two abortion drugs together with painkillers, the prosecutor said. Sentencing Worby on Friday, the judge, Mr Justice Joel Bennathan, told him: “You are a selfish man and set about aborting the baby without [the woman] knowing.” The judge also made a restraining order, barring Worby from contacting the woman indefinitely, and ordered that he pay her £10,000. Cepeda, 39, of Dereham, was sentenced to 22 months in prison suspended for two years after she pleaded guilty to supplying an instrument to procure a miscarriage. Andrew Oliver, mitigating for Cepeda, said she had acted out of “misguided loyalty to someone who was friends with her partner”. He said Cepeda, a cleaner who had no previous convictions, was “devastated she’s played a part in the harm and suffering that’s been caused” and “didn’t receive any financial or other benefits for the part that she played”. The judge said he accepted she had become involved only “due to the pressure or badgering of Stuart Worby”.","2024-12-06T17:00:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/06/norfolk-man-who-gave-abortion-drugs-to-unknowing-woman-jailed-for-12-years"
"abortion","Scottish ministers accused of failing women who cannot get later abortions","Campaigners have warned Scottish ministers that they are failing in their legal and moral duties as growing numbers of “extremely vulnerable women” have to travel hundreds of miles south because they cannot access later-term abortions in Scotland. Not one of Scotland’s 14 regional health boards provide abortion care after 20 weeks except in the specific cases of foetal abnormality or threat to a woman’s life. This is despite the Scottish government promising to rectify this “explicit inequality” three years ago, and abortion being legal on broad grounds until 24 weeks across the UK. Campaigners believe this is a result of systemic stigma around later abortion, with NHS managers unwilling to offer the service for what they deem to be social reasons rather than medical ones. Instead, the only alternative is for women to seek help from the charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) and make the lengthy, stressful and expensive journey to a clinic in England. Although most abortions take place a lot earlier than 20 weeks, a minority of women find themselves in need of care much later and for a variety of reasons. The abortion rights campaigner Lucy Grieve, the co-founder of Back Off Scotland, said: “The vast majority of women seeking an abortion after 20 weeks are extremely vulnerable. They might not have contacted services before because they have addiction issues, they are victims of domestic abuse or are very young and scared of admitting their pregnancy to their family.” Others experience a cryptic pregnancy, where the woman has no obvious symptoms. “I had no idea,” said Ashley, who was 23 years old and using regular contraception when she discovered she was 19 weeks pregnant. Although she was in a stable relationship, neither she nor her partner were “mentally or financially ready” to support a child together. She recalled of her first scan: “I just remember her face dropping. She said: ‘There’s nothing we can do for you in Scotland.’” Devastated and confused, Ashley was referred to BPAS, where her care was “fantastic”, she said. “But I can’t believe I had to phone a charity to get the support I needed. I’m part of the biggest health board in Scotland but they still couldn’t help me,” she added. Ashley and her partner had to spend hundred of pounds on an overnight trip to the BPAS clinic in Middlesex, an “overwhelming” journey, navigating unfamiliar transport and geography at a time when she was distressed, scared and in pain. The experience was made even worse when they were greeted on arrival at the clinic by anti-abortion protesters “shoving leaflets in our faces”. Looking back on the experience, Ashley said she was “at peace” with her choice to terminate the pregnancy, but that the stressful journey “did add to the trauma of the decision”. “No woman should have to go through that. It would have been so different to be able to do it from the comfort of my own home, without having to worry about finances,” she added. In 2024, 88 women from Scotland were treated by BPAS at their English clinics, up from 67 the previous year. A freedom of information request obtained by STV News earlier this month revealed that NHS Scotland had admitted internally this amounted to “an explicit inequality in service provision”. “If the NHS can’t provide this service then the Scottish government has a legal and moral obligation to find another provider,” said Grieve, whose group successfully campaigned for the introduction of buffer zones around sexual health clinics. Anti-abortion campaigners funded by the Texas-based group 40 Days for Life have been highly visible across Scotland over the past month. Although the newly introduced buffer zones have been observed, there was an arrest of a protester who allegedly breached the exclusion area around a hospital in Glasgow in February, days after the US vice-president, JD Vance, spread inaccurate claims about Scotland’s rules. Earlier this month, another activist whose case was cited by the US state department over “freedom of expression” concerns in the UK was convicted of breaching a buffer zone outside a clinic in Bournemouth. Grieve suggested there was “systemic stigma” about later-term abortion in Scotland. At present, there are only two doctors across the country sufficiently trained to carry out this procedure and no health board willing to host them, a situation Grieve described as “unusual and dangerous”. The BPAS chief executive, Heidi Stewart, said the current situation was “unacceptable”. She added: “BPAS has offered to work with government and health boards to establish a service within Scotland, but that offer has not been taken up. That choice has meant that hundreds of women have had to make the journey from Scotland to England for this vital care. “Across the rest of the UK, women are able to access this care closer to home – it is deeply unjust that Scottish women are left behind.” The Scottish government’s women’s health minister, Jenni Minto, said work to improve later-term abortion care in Scotland “has taken much longer than any of us would have wished” and that health boards must fund travel and accommodation costs “if patients do need to travel to England for treatment”.","2025-04-21T10:40:49Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/scottish-government-failing-women-who-cant-access-later-term-abortions-campaigners-say"
"abortion","Arizona says it will not enforce abortion ban until related lawsuit plays out","Weeks after Arizona voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, has agreed that the state will not enforce its 15-week abortion ban while a new lawsuit over the law plays out. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in Maricopa county superior court on behalf of Arizona abortion providers, argues that Arizona’s 15-week ban is now unconstitutional and should be overturned. In legal documents signed by Mayes and that will be filed alongside the lawsuit after the court formally accepts the case, Arizona agreed with providers not to prosecute people under the ban until 30 days after the litigation has wrapped up – a move that permits abortion providers in the state to resume performing abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy. “For two years, physicians’ hands have been tied when a patient needs to end a pregnancy after 15 weeks, including when they face serious pregnancy complications. But today we can once again provide care to people who want to end their pregnancy,” Dr Eric Reuss, one of the abortion providers who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. “We hope the courts will quickly recognize the harms of Arizona’s ban and strike it down once and for all.” The lawsuit marks the latest effort by advocates to make good on the pro-abortion rights ballot measures passed by seven states in the November elections. While these measures amended states’ constitutions to protect or expand abortion rights, they did not actually rewrite pre-existing state laws. Abortion restrictions must now be knocked down through litigation or legislation – processes that take time and whose outcomes are far from guaranteed. “It’s up to other state actors to do the work of going back and making sure that Arizona’s laws are in line with the really strong protections that are now in place in the constitution,” Rebecca Chan, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Reproductive Freedom Project, said in an interview. The national ACLU, the ACLU of Arizona, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and the law firm Perkins Coie are representing the plaintiffs in the Arizona lawsuit. Chan continued: “Challenging the 15-week ban is really the first step to fulfilling the promise of that amendment and we’re really excited to see that ban gone.” Over the last year, Arizona has been at the epicenter of numerous disputes over abortion rights. Last spring, the Arizona state supreme court agreed to let a 19th-century near-total abortion ban – which dates back to before Arizona became a state – take effect. That decision unleashed nationwide outrage and led the Republican-controlled state legislature to scramble to repeal the 19th-century law. Outside Arizona, voters also passed pro-abortion rights ballot measures in Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York state. Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri have already filed a lawsuit challenging the state’s near-total abortion ban as well as a slew of other restrictions on the procedure. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Wednesday. If all goes well for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive healthcare giant is expected to resume performing abortions in Missouri as soon as this week. Donald Trump’s incoming administration may undermine the success of these ballot measures, since federal abortion restrictions could override state-level protections. Although Trump has flip-flopped on whether to implement a nationwide ban, activists have already started drawing up wishlists of stringent anti-abortion policies. “There is absolutely the risk of a national abortion ban and there are many ways they may try to accomplish that,” Chan said. “But in this present moment, when that has not yet happened – and at this moment it is not yet guaranteed that it will happen – we do have this incredible opportunity to really effectuate this very, very strong protection that Arizona voters were emphatic that they wanted.”","2024-12-03T19:35:26Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/arizona-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Wisconsin supreme court seems hostile to 1849 abortion ban in oral arguments","During heated oral arguments on Monday morning, the Wisconsin supreme court appeared poised to find an 1849 law banning most abortions cannot be enforced. The legal status of abortion in Wisconsin has been contested since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and ended the right to abortion nationwide, triggering bans across the country – including in Wisconsin, where a 175-year-old ban immediately went into effect. Democrats in Wisconsin have seized on abortion as a campaign issue, with Justice Janet Protasiewicz expressing her support for abortion rights and winning a seat on the court in spring 2023. Protasiewicz’s election to the court helped flip the ideological balance on the bench, which is now controlled by a narrow liberal majority. It is highly unlikely the liberal-controlled court will uphold the ban. The 1849 statute, which was nullified by Roe v Wade and then reanimated when the landmark decision was overturned, declares that ending “the life of an unborn child” is a felony, except when required to save the life of the mother. In July 2023, a Dane county judge ruled that the 1849 ban applies only to feticide and not “consensual” abortion, citing a previous ruling that interpreted the statute as an anti-feticide law, and in September, providers including Planned Parenthood resumed offering abortion care. The Sheboygan county district attorney Joel Urmanski appealed the ruling, which is now before the Wisconsin supreme court. “The position of the circuit court below … is ultimately indefensible,” said Matthew Thome, an attorney representing Urmanski, during his opening argument. Thome argued that the 1849 law should be interpreted to “prohibit consensual abortions from conception until birth, subject to an exception when it is necessary to save the life of the mother”. Justice Jill Karofsky interrogated Urmanski’s interpretation of the law, asking if it would provide exceptions for rape, incest, the health of the mother, or fetal abnormalities. “Just to be clear, a 12-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by her father and as a result, became pregnant, under your interpretation … she would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term?” asked Karofsky. She noted that the “penalty for aborting after a sexual assault would be more severe than the penalty for the sexual assault”. In response to a question about the medical consequences of a ban, Thome responded that he was unsure, given that he is “not a doctor”. “I fear that what you are asking this court to do is to sign the death warrants of women and children and pregnant people in this state, because under your interpretation, they could all be denied life saving medical care, while the medical professionals who are charged with taking care of them are forced to sit idly by,” said Karofsky. The court weighed the question of whether laws that were passed regulating abortion while Roe was in effect “impliedly repealed” the 1849 ban and rendered it unenforceable. “All of those statues” passed after 1973 and before it was overturned, “just go to the dust pile?” asked Karofsky. Justice Brian Hagedorn, a conservative-leaning judge, argued, of the 1849 ban, that “the law is still there”, adding that “the judiciary doesn’t get to edit laws, the judiciary doesn’t get to rewrite them, we didn’t delete it, we prevented its enforcement”. The assistant attorney general Hannah Jurss disagreed, arguing that “there is nothing in the text of these statutes that says in the event that Roe is overturned we somehow go back to the old law and throw out all of the new ones,” drawing a distinction between Wisconsin’s more than a century old law and “trigger” laws passed in certain states that were specifically designed to go into effect after Roe v Wade was overturned. A separate case, which the Wisconsin supreme court has also agreed to hear, would decide whether the right to abortion is protected under the state’s constitution – possibly opening the door to challenge other laws regulating abortion in the state.","2024-11-11T19:28:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Pope Leo criticizes Trump’s hardline immigration policies: ‘I don’t know if that’s pro-life’","Pope Leo has strongly criticized Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies, questioning whether they were in line with the Catholic church’s “pro-life” teachings. “Someone who says I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life,” the pontiff told journalists outside the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, in the Alban Hills, near Rome. The Catholic church’s position that life is sacred from conception until natural death is one of the 1.4 billion-member religious denomination’s strongest teachings. Leo, the first American pope, was responding to a question from a US journalist who asked about the country’s politics. The White House said Trump was elected based on his many promises, including mass deportations, which have become an issue of fierce political division among US voters. “He is keeping his promise to the American people,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. Elected in May to replace the late Pope Francis, Leo has shown a much more reserved style than his predecessor, who frequently criticized the Trump administration. Leo was asked about a decision by the archdiocese of Chicago to give an award to Dick Durbin, a Democratic Illinois senator who supports abortion rights. The move has attracted vocal criticism from conservative Catholics, including several US bishops. “It is very important to look at the overall work that the senator has done,” said the pope, Reuters reported. “I understand the difficulty and the tensions but I think, as I myself have spoken in the past, it’s important to look at many issues that are related to what is the teaching of the church,” he said. “Someone who says I am against abortion but says I am in favour of the death penalty is not really pro-life.” The Chicago archdiocese’s decision to confer a lifetime award on Durbin next month was immediately plunged into controversy when Bishop Thomas John Paprocki, the leader of the church in the Illinois capital of Springfield, objected, saying Durbin was “unfit to receive the proposed award or any Catholic honor”. Some other groups also objected. Durbin on Tuesday night turned down the award that he was to receive on 3 November, the State Journal-Register reported. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago said on the archdiocese website, where Durbin’s withdrawal was announced, that he was saddened by the news that he would not accept the Keep Hope Alive award, but he respected his decision. “But I want to make clear that the decision to present him an award was specifically in recognition of his singular contribution to immigration reform and his unwavering support of immigrants, which is so needed in our day,” Cupich wrote. He added that he was witnessing divisions with the Catholic community in the US “dangerously deepen” and called it a tragedy. Durbin announced in April that he will not seek re-election in 2026, after almost 30 years in the Senate.","2025-10-01T13:07:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/pope-leo-trump-immigration-policies"
"abortion","Make no mistake: this Trump presidency will continue to attack abortion rights","Abortion rights initiatives were on the ballot in 10 states on Tuesday, and won in seven of them. One of the losers was prop 4, Florida’s abortion rights measure, which received a whopping 57% of the vote but failed to meet the state’s unusually high 60% threshold, meaning that the state’s six-week ban will remain in place. Asked about the Florida abortion rights proposition ahead of the election, Trump said that when he went to cast his ballot near Palm Beach, he would vote against it. It has always been a little hard to believe that Donald Trump personally hates abortion, even if it is abundantly clear how little he thinks of women. Trump, after all, has claimed to have numerous conflicting positions on abortion rights throughout his life. And his brand of masculinity is boorish, vulgar, and above all, sexually entitled – far from the priggish, repressed moralism of more classical anti-abortion figures like Mike Pence. Maybe this is why, though Trump appointed three of the six justices who overturned Roe v Wade and has boasted about his role in ending the right to an abortion, many voters seem to not quite believe that he will continue to suppress the procedure further in his coming second term. Abortion rights measures won in several states that Trump carried on Tuesday – including Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Missouri, all states that Trump won. A lot of people, it seems, voted for abortion rights in their own states, and then also voted for Donald Trump – who, make no mistake, will move to restrict abortion access nationwide when he returns to the White House next year. Trump, of course, has insisted that this will not happen – which on its own might be a decent indication that it will. But there is evidence that the new Trump administration will pursue a broad agenda restricting women’s rights, including nationwide attacks on abortion access, even beyond that offered by Trump’s habitual pattern of self-serving dishonesty. Republicans have won control of the Senate and are likely to capture the House of Representatives; if they do, they may well advance legislation to ban abortion nationwide. (And to pass it: there is no reason to believe that a Republican governing trifecta will preserve the filibuster.) A bill like this would probably not be termed a “ban” by its sponsors: Republicans, wary of the public disapproval of abortion bans, have started calling their new abortion restrictions by chillingly imprecise euphemisms, such as “standard” or even “protection”. But the effect of the laws are the same: to outlaw abortions. This could take the form of a gestational limit, or of the federal recognition of fetal personhood. Trump may well sign such legislation into law, eliminating abortion rights even in Democratic-controlled states and those that have recently passed abortion rights referendums with the stroke of a pen. But Republicans do not even need to manage to pass a bill through Congress to make abortion much more difficult to get. Trump can simply restrict abortion through federal agencies. He will soon be in control of the FDA, for example, which regulates the abortion drug mifepristone, part of a two-drug regimen that now accounts for most abortions in the United States. Mifepristone is a safe, effective drug that allows abortions to be performed in the privacy of patients’ homes, with little of the expensive clinical involvement and overhead that makes surgical abortions more time-intensive and costly for providers and patients alike. Naturally, the anti-abortion movement hates it. Since Dobbs, a coalition of anti-choice groups and Republican attorneys general have been suing the FDA, seeking to overturn the agency’s 2000 approval of the drug. Trump will be able to rescind access to it almost immediately, taking the drug off the legal US market. If he gives the anti-choice movement what they want, he may also direct the FDA to revoke approval of the most reliable forms of female-controlled contraception, like Plan B, IUDs, and certain birth control pills, which the anti-choice movement falsely claims cause abortions. Trump is likely to also revive enforcement of the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 1873 law that bans the shipment of anything that could be used to induce an abortion through the US mail. The Comstock Act has not been enforced in decades – parts of it were repealed in the 20th century, and other sections were long rendered moot by supreme court precedents like Roe and Casey – and would have the effect of criminalizing much abortion care. Since Dobbs, several Democratic-controlled states have passed what are called shield laws, which protect doctors who mail abortion drugs from states where the procedure is legal into states that have bans. This mail-order abortion operation is, for now, technically legal: it has preserved women’s independence and dignity and no doubt saved thousands of lives. But when the Comstock Act is enforced, much of this sector of abortion provision will disappear. Combined with the revocation of FDA approval for mifepristone, this will inevitably mean that many women seeking abortions will turn to black market surgical abortion providers, and suffer the risks attendant to such procedures. A return to pre-Roe levels of abortion ban-related mortality could probably follow. Trump is also likely to reverse the Biden administration’s guidance on Emtala, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care to all patients facing health crises. Emtala has been the subject of much post-Dobbs litigation, as states like Idaho and Texas have sought to argue that their abortion bans supersede the federal law, thus requiring hospitals in their states to withhold emergency abortions from women in medical emergencies who will suffer or die without them. The US supreme court declined to decide the issue last summer; a Trump administration may help to resolve it for them. This is all just what Trump could do on his own in his first years back in office. But the impact of a Trump term on American women’s access to abortion will be felt long after Trump himself is no longer with us. Trump will probably appoint at least two supreme court justices to lifetime seats in his coming term; he will also fill an unknown number of vacancies on the lower federal courts, whose judges also serve for life. These judges are all likely to be anti-abortion zealots, as are the federal bureaucrats Trump will bring in to staff agencies such as the FDA, CDC and Department of Health and Human Services. We are already living in an era when abortion access is restricted more than it has been in decades. Now, it will be restricted more. We may well never have as much reproductive freedom as we do now ever again. American women are well advised to prepare for this, to not wait for the Trump administration to restrict the tools they use to control their own bodies. Sterilization and long-acting birth control remain accessible, for now; women who want these should move quickly to get them. Plan B and abortion pills can both be purchased ahead of time and kept on hand in the privacy of a medicine cabinet; such purchases may provide security and peace of mind to those staring down the barrel of another Trump term. Abortion, as we know, will never be eliminated; it can only be less safe, and less dignified. But there are few things as strong as women’s determination to control their own lives. That determination is certainly stronger than the law.

"abortion","Harris stresses abortion rights and early voting in packed Atlanta rally","Kamala Harris highlighted the threat to women’s reproductive rights and Donald Trump’s apparent exhaustion at a rally Saturday in south Atlanta, continuing a full-court press for votes in Georgia as early voting breaks records here. The race continues to appear close in Georgia, with polls suggesting the Republican nominee holds a one-point lead in the state. Trump has made multiple appearances in Georgia and has a rally with Turning Point Action planned in Gwinnett county, outside Atlanta, next week. However, the National Rifle Association canceled a planned Saturday rally with Trump in Savannah, citing a “scheduling conflict”. Trump has also canceled several news interviews over the last week. The Trump campaign has angrily pushed back against a suggestion raised by a staffer that Trump had been exhausted by the appearances. But Harris has seized the idea as a rallying cry. “And now, he’s ducking debates, and canceling interviews because of exhaustion,” Harris said. “And when he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed that he tends to go off script and ramble, and generally for the life of him can’t finish a thought? … Folks are exhausted with someone trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. We’re exhausted. That’s why I say it’s time to turn the page on that.” Harris returned to familiar themes on a day of perfect Atlanta weather, describing the “opportunity economy” as one that brings down the cost of living for prescription medication, groceries and housing through anti-price-gouging initiatives, while providing financial support for new parents and entrepreneurs. Extending Medicare coverage for home healthcare services would prevent working adults from having to quit a productive job or spend down savings to take care of aging parents. “It’s about dignity,” she said in the city’s Lakewood Amphitheater. Harris will attend services Sunday at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a majority-Black megachurch in the heart of Atlanta’s Black suburbs in south DeKalb county. New Birth and other large Black churches in Georgia traditionally organize a “souls to the polls” push on Sunday early voting days. As of 5pm Saturday, about 1.3 million Georgians had cast ballots early in person, more than double the 2020 pace on the fifth day of early voting in Georgia. In 2020, about 2.7 million out of 5 million voters cast ballots early in person, with more than two-thirds of votes cast before election day. Absentee ballots are down sharply, however, a reflection of the end of the pandemic and changes to absentee ballot rules. Early voting provides real-time feedback for campaign strategists hoping to target voters who have not yet cast a ballot. Democrats pressed their supporters in Georgia to vote early in 2020 and 2022, a strategy that helped lead the party to victory in the 2020 presidential race and Georgia’s two vital wins in the US Senate. “Georgia, out of nowhere, we made a way,” said the US senator Jon Ossoff. “This is an election that will determine the character of our republic. This is much deeper than Democrats versus Republicans. Former president Trump is unfit for the presidency.” But so far this year, early voting in rural and ex-urban areas of Georgia, rich in Republican votes, has outpaced core Atlanta turnout rates. Donald Trump has pointedly encouraged his supporters to vote early this year, a tacit acknowledgement of the strategic error of 2020. Early voting also began on Saturday in Nevada, where Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Las Vegas. The former president also poked fun at Trump, telling the audience: “We don’t need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump with no guardrails looks like.” In Georgia, early voters among Democrats have been vocal about abortion policy driving their votes. The deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, two Georgia women who couldn’t access timely maternal health service or legal abortions, have resonated in the rhetoric of the election. “Let us agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: the government should not be telling her what to do,” Harris said. The rally rolled clips of Thurman’s family describing their grief, and then of Trump mocking their loss in a town hall interview hosted by Fox News. “He belittles their sorrow, making it about himself and his television ratings,” Harris said. “It’s cruel.” But the Lakewood rally was plainly about driving turnout and enthusiasm among Black voters. Usher, the Atlanta-based R&amp;B musician and dancer, spoke early to the crowd, calling on people to vote early for Harris, and to reach out to friends and family. “How we vote – I mean, everything that we do in the next 17 days – will affect our children, our grandchildren, of the people we love the most,” Usher said. Ryan Wilson, the co-founder of private networking hub the Gathering Spot and a notable Atlanta entrepreneur, discussed the Harris proposal to offer up to $50,000 in grants to Black entrepreneurs. “That would have been a game changer for me,” he said. “Vice-President Harris’s opportunity agenda for Black men who provide folks like me the tools to achieve generational wealth, lower costs and protect their rights. And what would Donald Trump do? I think it’s fair to say: nothing.”","2024-10-20T00:14:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/19/harris-abortion-rights-early-voting-atlanta"
"abortion","Missouri lawmaker proposes registry of pregnant women ‘at risk’ for abortions","A Republican lawmaker in Missouri has introduced legislation to create a registry of pregnant women who are “at risk” of having an abortion – a proposal the bill’s author characterized as an “eHarmony for babies” that could also help match adoptive parents with babies. If passed, the bill would create two registries: one for people “at risk” of abortions and one for people looking to adopt. Members of each registry could access the other, while Missouri government officials would be tasked with helping members meet each other and facilitating adoptions. The bill’s goal is to “reduce the number of preventable abortions in Missouri”. “Mothers who choose to put their children up for adoption need to match with prospective adoptive parents,” Gerard Harms, an adoption attorney and the author of the Save MO Babies Act, testified in a Missouri state legislative committee hearing on Tuesday. “That’s what this database is.” The bill does not define what puts someone “at risk” of abortion. The Save MO Babies Act is the latest in a series of anti-abortion efforts to expand government tracking of pregnant women and abortion patients. Project 2025, the famous conservative policy playbook, suggested that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expand its “surveillance” to force states to turn over data on “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”, as well as information on miscarriages, stillbirths, and “treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child (such as chemotherapy)”. Project 2025 also proposes rolling back Joe Biden-era guidance that uses the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa), the US law governing patient privacy, to narrow the circumstances under which healthcare providers can talk to law enforcement about patients who may have undergone abortions. While still a senator, JD Vance signed on to a letter condemning the guidance. Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that has spearheaded much of the rightwing attack on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, has also sued over it. In an interview with Time last year, Donald Trump signaled that he would be open to letting states monitor women’s pregnancies to ascertain whether they had undergone abortions. “I think they might do that,” he said, adding: “The states are going to say. It’s irrelevant whether I’m comfortable or not.” (He later tried to walk that statement back.) At the state level, Indiana is embroiled in a legal battle over abortion patients’ records, as the state’s Republican governor and a local anti-abortion group have sought to access records about the few people who have managed to recently undergo the procedure in Indiana. (The state only permits abortions in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency.) A judge ruled this week to block the records’ release. If the anti-abortion group obtains the records, the judge wrote, “it will be free to publicize those medical records further, including by posting them on the Internet, depriving patients of their privacy, which cannot be adequately remedied through money damages”. On Tuesday, Harms suggested that people had misunderstood his intentions in writing the bill. The proposed Missouri registry, he said, was not an attempt “to go out and data-mine”. Instead, he suggested that abortion clinics could provide patients with information about the registry so they could join it on their own. “This is a completely voluntary program as it comes to the parents of these children,” he said. The bill, Harms added, was “inartfully drafted” and suggested that lawmakers should fine-tune the legislation. It is not clear whether the bill will move forward. But Missouri Republican state lawmakers have introduced a barrage of other abortion restrictions, including legislation to roll back a November ballot measure that added abortion rights to the state constitution. Missouri has moved to the epicenter of the national war over the procedure over the last few months. After the passage of the November ballot measure, abortion providers sued to strike down the state’s near-total abortion ban and a raft of other restrictions on the procedure. Abortions finally resumed in the state this week.","2025-02-22T12:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/missouri-abortion-registry-bill"
"abortion","Americans stockpile abortion pills and hormones ahead of ‘reproductive apocalypse’ under Trump","When the presidential election results were handed down on Wednesday, Rebecca Gomperts, the founder of Aid Access, the No 1 supplier of abortion pills by mail in the United States, was huddled in a Paris apartment with her team of eight American physicians and 15 support staff. The group – which usually operates remotely, shipping out more than 9,000 abortion pills a month – had convened in person before the election, knowing they might have to spring into action. They were right: as news of Trump’s victory spread, the website received more than 5,000 requests for abortion pills in less than 12 hours – a surge even larger than the day after Roe v Wade fell. “I can see all the new requests ticking in as we’re talking,” Gomperts said in a phone call on Wednesday afternoon. “We’ve never seen this before.” The scenario repeated itself across the country as news of Trump’s victory broke, with women’s and trans health providers getting inundated with requests for services that their patients feared might be banned in a Trump administration. The telehealth service Wisp saw a 300% increase in requests for emergency contraception; the abortion pill finder site Plan C saw a 625% increase in traffic. “Clearly, people are trying to plan for the reproductive apocalypse that we anticipate will be happening under a Trump presidency,” said Elisa Wells, the co-founder of Plan C. For Gomperts and her team at Aid Access, the moment did not come as a shock: they’d been preparing for it since the last Trump administration, when Gomperts, a Dutch physician, expanded her international abortion pill service into the United States. Since then, Aid Access has devised a system in which physicians in states where abortion is legal prescribe and ship abortion pills to patients in states where it is not. The non-profit eventually expanded to the team of eight physicians in four states, along with a help desk that is available 24/7. But the scale of the demand on Wednesday – five times more than a usual day – was shocking even to them. “We have an extremely streamlined process and we are capable of dealing with all the requests really fast,” Gomperts said. “But it’s much more [than usual]. And I think the reason is people are now much more aware – people are aware of the possibility of the abortion pill and aware of the threat it will be taken off the market.” Trump has flip-flopped on the prospect of a national abortion ban, at one point saying women who obtain abortions illegally should be punished, and at others saying the decision should be left up to the states. But his supreme court appointments paved the way for the overturning of Roe in 2022, and his appointments to other, lower courts have held up even the strictest of abortion bans in red states like Texas. There are also multiple ways he could go after the prescribing and shipping of abortion pills, which now account for the majority of abortions in the US. The panic didn’t just extend to abortion pills. The online women’s health provider Wisp told the Guardian it had already tripled its usual daily sales of emergency contraception by 11.30am on Wednesday. It also saw a huge increase in orders of bulk Plan B packs, which went from about 30% of their emergency contraceptive orders earlier in the month to nearly 90% on Wednesday. New patient requests for Plan B also soared from 50% of their orders to 70%. The telehealth site Hey Jane said requests for birth control had doubled, and Winx, a similar women’s health service, said it had sold six times as many doses of Plan B by Wednesday afternoon as it had in the past seven days combined. “Women are smart,” Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said. “We see what is coming, and we are protecting ourselves.” Dr Crystal Beal, meanwhile, was dealing with an influx of emails on Wednesday from trans patients concerned about their access to hormones and hormone-blocking therapy. Beal runs a site called QueerDoc, which provides estrogen, testosterone and hormone-blocking drugs. Trump is hostile to trans rights, vowing to punish doctors who provide gender-affirming care to minors, and Beal’s patients wanted to know how to protect themselves from a second Trump administration. By early on Wednesday afternoon, QueerDoc had already received more messages that day than it would in a typical week. “Some of it is ‘How can I safeguard my access to medication?’” Beal said. “Some of it is ‘Should I change [the gender on] my legal documents back so I’m safer? Should I stop taking medication so I’m safer?’” Beal said the service was advising patients to stock up on as much of their hormone treatment as state law and their insurance coverage allowed, and even suggesting trans men reuse single-use vials of testosterone to make them stretch farther. When it came to stopping medication or changing paperwork, Beal said, that was a more personal question. “I have to tell people I ultimately can’t predict the future or make that choice or decision for them, and I certainly can’t give legal advice,” Beal said. “But changing your documentation or stopping your medication does not make you any less of a man or a woman, or any less trans. Who we are is not designated by what our documents say or what medications we take.” QueerDoc sent a message to its patients on Wednesday morning reminding them that while they were worried about the future, “trans people have always been here, and we will continue to persist”, Beal said. And all of the providers who spoke to the Guardian urged patients not to panic and said they would keep providing services until the day they legally could not – and in some cases, even after that. “Someone gave us a donation today with the message ‘Don’t let the bastards get you down,’” said Wells. “Politicians are not going to stop access, and they’re not going to stop us.”","2024-11-07T12:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/abortion-pills-hormones-trump"
"abortion","Trump moves to push employers on IVF coverage and lower fertility drug costs","The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it is urging US employers to create new fertility benefit options to cover in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other infertility treatments. In an announcement from the Oval Office, Donald Trump also said his administration had cut a deal with the drug manufacturer EMD Serono to lower the cost of one of its fertility drugs and list the drug on the government website TrumpRx. These moves, the president said, would lead to “many more beautiful American children”. “In the Trump administration, we want to make it easier for all couple to have babies, raise children and have the families they’ve always dreamed about,” Trump said. Employers are encouraged to offer the fertility benefit option separately from their medical coverage, similar to how dental and vision coverage is usually offered to employees. The labor department, the treasury and the health department will on Thursday also release guidance on how employers can legally create the option. However, Republicans who spoke at Trump’s announcement framed the benefit as a “recommendation”, indicating that employers will not be required to offer the coverage nor receive government subsidies for doing so. They also stressed that the benefit will be structured to give employers immense flexibility to determine what will or will not be covered. Without new incentives to offer IVF coverage, it is unclear how many employers will ultimately support it. Trump, who has called himself the “fertilization president”, made support for infertility treatments a major part of his re-election campaign, especially after the nation erupted in outrage when the Alabama supreme court deemed embryos “extrauterine children”. Because IVF can lead to the creation of unused or discarded embryos, that decision temporarily forced many Alabama IVF providers to stop working. Yet in the months since taking office, the Trump administration has remained quiet on the issue. In February, he signed an executive order directing the administration’s domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the price tag of IVF, which often costs tens of thousands of dollars and is frequently not covered by insurance. A detailed report on the recommendations was supposed to be made public by May. No report ever emerged. While IVF is extremely popular among Americans, the GOP’s deep ties to the anti-abortion movement have made it something of a political landmine among elected Republicans. The movement has long opposed IVF, as advocates believe that embryos are people. White House officials have in recent months discussed the possibility of supporting restorative reproductive medicine (RRM), a constellation of therapies that purport to restore people’s “natural” fertility. Although RRM is popular among anti-abortion advocates and adherents of the “make America healthy again” movement, several major medical organizations say there is little quality evidence that RRM is more effective at helping people have babies than mainstream fertility medicine. Trump did not mention RRM in his Thursday address. When a reporter asked if he had any thoughts on anti-abortion activists’ opposition to IVF, Trump said: “I think this is very pro-life.” Pronatalist rhetoric, which holds that having children is important to a county’s wellbeing and that the state should incentivize people to procreate, dominated the press conference that followed Trump’s address. Robert F Kennedy, the health and human services secretary, highlighted the falling US birthrate, while Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, claimed that Kennedy and Trump are “great leaders” because they have big families. People who want more children but can’t have them, Oz added, are “under-babied”. “There’s gonna be a lot of Trump babies,” Oz said. “It turns out the fundamental creative force in society is about making babies.”","2025-10-16T21:08:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/trump-ivf-announcement"
"abortion","Goethe immortalised the shaming of German women 200 years ago – we’re still at it","Every nation has literary classics that shape its cultural identity. Germans have Faust, Goethe’s play about the successful but dissatisfied scientist Dr Heinrich Faust, who makes a deal with the devil. Faust has been performed, referenced and read in schools for more than two centuries now. Interestingly, the most tragic character in this tragedy is not the protagonist, but his “love interest”, Gretchen – a teenage girl groomed by the old man, impregnated and socially ostracised. Her solution? She drowns her “illegitimate” newborn child, accepts her death penalty and rejects Faust’s offer to save her from prison. In God’s mercy, the Christian girl seeks salvation and off goes Faust with the devil to new adventures in Faust, Part Two. What would Gretchen do today, I wonder. Her fate is not only a result of sexual abuse and an inherently misogynistic morality, but also nonexistent reproductive rights. In today’s Germany, abortion is still illegal under the criminal code. It is nonpunishable under certain conditions, particularly during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but nonetheless, in practice a modern-day Gretchen might have difficulty finding a doctor willing to perform a termination, depending on where she lives. Moreover, Gretchen might be intimidated by the stigma, which is not just societal but enshrined in German law. For decades now, the so-called paragraph 218 that criminalises abortion has been subject to political debate. Poland and the US are living proof that, even if not prosecuting anyone for carrying out or procuring an abortion is the accepted practice, that can be toppled quickly when ultraconservatives are in power. The last German government, under the Social Democratic party’s (SPD) Olaf Scholz, made an attempt to reform paragraph 218 before losing power, but failed. Obviously, nobody expects the current German government, led by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to take any progressive decisions on the right to physical self-determination. But what is now happening at the Bundestag goes further than preserving this outdated law – which must surely fall foul of international human rights standards. After weeks of an orchestrated rightwing social media campaign, the election by the Bundestag of three new judges to the constitutional court (Germany’s highest court) was unexpectedly cancelled last week. The reason: one of candidates, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a 54-year-old jurist and professor, stands accused of holding extremist leftwing positions, because she supports the decriminalisation of abortion. Anyone who has listened to or read Brosius-Gersdorf’s judicial reasoning knows that she fully relies on the German constitution in her arguments and carefully evaluates the rights of the mother and the embryo depending on the phase of pregnancy. In the early phase, according to Brosius-Gersdorf, the mother’s rights predominate. In the later phase, as soon as the embryo is viable, the embryo’s right to life has to be protected. Claims that Brosius-Gersdorf is in favour of abortions until the ninth month of pregnancy are blatant lies, spread by rightwing media as well as far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians. The fact that Brosius-Gersdorf, who was nominated by the SPD, also argues for a ban on the AfD due to the classification of it by German intelligence as rightwing extremist might have been the real trigger for the propaganda campaign against her. Other accusations have circulated around the jurist’s recommendation for compulsory vaccination during the pandemic, and allegations that her PhD thesis was plagiarised (which were proven to be false). But not until the focus fell on her allegedly radical views on abortion did the mobilisation succeed. Parts of the governing coalition – 50 to 60 Christian Democrat MPs – raised doubts about her nomination, which led to postponement of the vote, which will probably now be delayed until after the summer recess. Appointments to the constitutional court require a two-thirds parliamentary majority in a secret ballot. Her critics now expect Brosius-Gersdorf to withdraw, although the SPD, Greens and the leftwing party Die Linke continue to uphold her nomination. Now, all of this might sound very familiar to those who have followed the US culture wars of the past decade. Some commentators speak of the “Trumpification of German politics”, since the whole debacle is founded on fake news and defamation. But the stigma of abortion itself is not an imported phenomenon. It is part of German cultural identity, perpetuated by the Gretchen tragedy, which has never really gone out of date. Paragraph 218, by the way, is a relic from the 1871 criminal code and almost as old as Faust. Gretchen would certainly be surprised that so little has changed when it comes to bodily autonomy.

"abortion","Arizona’s abortion U-turn points to Republican break from anti-abortion movement","In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 50-year-long partnership between Republicans and anti-abortion activists has steadily fractured as political backlash to abortion bans has mounted. But perhaps the biggest crack emerged on Wednesday, when Arizona’s Republican-controlled state legislature moved to repeal the state’s 1864 near-total abortion ban. After days of national outcry over an Arizona supreme court ruling that upheld the 1864 ban, passed before Arizona became a state, three Republicans in the state house broke ranks to vote with Democrats to support a repeal. Last week, two Republicans in the state senate also voted with Democrats to advance a similar repeal. As long as those Republican votes hold firm, Democrats will likely send the repeal to Arizona’s Democratic governor in May. Before the Wednesday vote, anti-abortion activists spent days lobbying Republicans to stand against the repeal. Yet despite their obvious displeasure afterward, some anti-abortion activists have held their fire. Rather than immediately threatening to primary the Republicans who defected from their cause, some advocates have struck a relatively muted tone, grudgingly urging lawmakers to at least back a 15-week ban, which is currently in effect in Arizona. Before the fall of Roe, anti-abortion activists were becoming increasingly hardline, often pressuring the GOP to drop candidates who lacked anti-abortion bona fides. But after Wednesday, rather than directing their ire at the Republicans who are making the repeal possible, they have largely blamed the usual suspects: abortion rights advocates. “The most protective pro-life law in the country is poised to fall to the appetites of pro-abortion activists,” Cathi Herrod, president of the powerful Center for Arizona Policy, said in a statement, adding that she supported efforts to “defend the state’s 15-week law if the pre-Roe law was repealed”. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, joined Herrod in defending the 15-week ban. Abortion foes are fearful of a potential November ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. “Kari Lake and all GOP candidates and elected officials must bring clarity to Arizona voters by campaigning vigorously in support of Arizona’s 15-week protection with exceptions and in opposition to the extreme no-limits abortion amendment,” Dannenfelser said in a statement of her own, which also mourned the probable fall of the 1864 law. Kari Lake, running to represent Arizona in the US senate, has in recent days, repeatedly flip-flopped on her position on abortion. Ingrid Duran, state legislative director for the National Right to Life, another leading anti-abortion organization, said she was “surprised” by the Arizona Republicans’ change of heart. But she said she believes the movement’s overall relationship with the GOP can recover. “I feel like this pivot has been solely based on some of the fear mongering that has been taking place from our opposition, and the people are responding to that, and some are caving into this pressure,” Duran said in an interview. “We have always been a movement that has been there for the long haul. And even with a setback like this, I don’t think that that should deter us from trying to save as many lives as possible.” Next year, Duran said, her organization may try to once again pursue some kind of abortion ban in Arizona, such as a six-week ban. “Arizona has some of the most radical anti-abortion activists around,” said Jennifer Holland, a US history professor at the University of Oklahoma and the author of Tiny You: A Western History of the Anti-Abortion Movement. “But I do think that now, after Roe’s been overturned, the movement is fragmenting a little bit more in terms of strategy, partly because the political landscape is just so different.” Between 1973, when the US supreme court decided Roe, and 2022, when the court overturned it, the GOP and the anti-abortion movement grew to operate in lock-step. The anti-abortion movement handed Republicans ardent voters; in exchange, Republicans in state legislatures voted in favor of abortion restrictions. For the GOP, those votes were a cheap way to build a base, since the constitutional right to abortion that Roe established blocked many abortion restrictions from going into effect and thus shielded Republicans from political fallout. But now that Roe is gone, the GOP has struggled to distance itself from its own policies. Outrage over Roe’s death cost Republicans votes in the 2022 midterms. A flurry of ballot measures to protect abortion rights have succeeded even in states as red as Kansas and Kentucky. Ultimately, failures in state races and legislatures will amp up anti-abortion activists’ focus on the presidential race, and the possibility for a national abortion ban that could come with a Donald Trump victory, according to Holland. “The more that they lose in places like Arizona and West Virginia and Kansas, I think that there’s even more pressure for national bans,” Holland said. “This movement has this moral goal. It is neither here nor there whether it is democratically reached or democratically supported. The goal is there should be no abortion because it’s murder. So if that principle loses in more and more states, then the only solutions that achieve that goal are federal.”","2024-04-26T10:00:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/26/arizona-republicans-anti-abortion-break-elections"
"abortion","A dystopian surveillance fear has become reality in Texas","Texas’s Flocked-up abortion laws Hello and welcome to the latest edition of “lo and behold, the dystopian thing that women and activists warned would happen ends up happening”. This time the issue is automated license plate readers (ALPRs), which capture (no prizes for guessing!) license plate data and allow law enforcement to build a picture of where a particular vehicle has been. There’s no opting out of being tracked: if you drive, you should simply assume that these cameras, which are sometimes hidden in objects such as traffic cones, are logging your movements. And you should assume that this license plate data can be combined with other surveillance data to paint a very detailed picture of your life. Privacy only exists for our billionaire overlords these days. The rest of us are just data points. There are obviously plenty of legitimate uses to ALPRs. Their proponents will wax lyrical about how they can help solve carjackings and kidnappings. But, like all technology, they are ripe for abuse. They are particularly ripe for abuse in an increasingly authoritarian US, full of lawmakers who want to control women’s bodies. Back in 2022, a few months after Roe v Wade was overturned, the Guardian published a piece on ALPRs warning that “an expanding web of license plate readers could be ‘weaponized’ against abortion”. It focused on a company called Flock, one of the big players in this space, which promises a “holistic solution to crime”. Flock’s technology could be used to “criminalize people seeking reproductive health and further erode people’s ability to move about their daily lives free from being tracked and traced”, one expert told the Guardian at the time. Another civil rights expert warned that Flock, which has stated that it is happy to provide technology to help enact whatever laws have been passed, “illustrates how surveillance isn’t actually about benefiting society or protecting people – it’s about enforcing the political goals of those in power”. Unfortunately, all these experts have been proved right. This week 404 Media reported that a Texas police officer used Flock to perform a nationwide search of more than 83,000 ALPR cameras while looking for a woman who had had an abortion. Abortion is almost entirely illegal in Texas but law enforcement reportedly looked at cameras in states such as Washington and Illinois, where abortion is legal. Anti-abortion voices love to argue that they’re not trying to control women, they’re trying to protect women. Funnily enough this same talking point came up in this case. Sheriff Adam King of Johnson county, Texas, told 404 Media that the woman had self-administered the abortion “and her family was worried that she was going to bleed to death, and we were trying to find her to get her to a hospital.” He added: “We weren’t trying to block her from leaving the state or whatever to get an abortion. It was about her safety.” Perhaps this was true in this case. Many of the details are still unclear so it’s hard to tell. But even if this was purely benevolent surveillance, you can certainly see where all this is headed. “This incident is undeniably a harbinger of more AI-enabled reproductive surveillance and investigations to come,” Ashley Emery, a senior policy analyst in reproductive health and rights at the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, told 404 Media. “Especially for women of color who are already over-surveilled and over-policed, the stakes couldn’t be higher.” “Texas is the land of freedom,” Governor Greg Abbott recently proclaimed. If you’re a woman in Texas, however, “freedom” seems to have quite a strange definition. Not only are you not allowed freedom over your reproductive decisions, a number of Texas city councils (some of which are composed entirely of male lawmakers) have been trying to pass travel bans that would stop Texans from driving to abortion appointments in other states. Abortion bans, attempted travel bans, and a network of surveillance technology that can be used to enforce these bans: this is what “freedom” for women in Texas looks like.

"abortion","One of the last US clinics for later abortions closes just as it’s needed most: ‘There’s a lack of understanding of what people go through’","One Tuesday morning in April, Alicia Moreno and the rest of the staff at Boulder abortion clinic learned that the clinic’s owner, Dr Warren Hern, was closing the clinic on Friday. One of the few abortion clinics in the US that performed abortions past the second trimester would, after 50 years, shutter its doors. They sprang into action. Suddenly, multiple patients who had been scheduled for abortions had to go somewhere else. Using secure lines, Moreno and other staffers called abortion clinics across the country to see who could take the patients. Because Boulder Abortion Clinic typically helped patients schedule flights and hotels, they had to reschedule all those logistics – while ensuring that nothing cost too much, since more than 90% of the clinic’s patients relied on outside funding to help pay for their abortions. “It was hardest on the patients that were already scheduled,” Moreno said. “They’re already in a really shitty circumstance, and we’re just like: ‘Haha, just kidding. You’re not coming to Colorado now. You’re going to DC in four days.’” Abortions that take place later on in pregnancy are rare: in 2022, the year the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, about 1% took place at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the latest data from the CDC. But later abortions may be on the rise. Before Roe fell, about 8% of abortion patients living in states that today ban the procedure ended their pregnancies in the second trimester, according to not-yet-published research by a team involving Diana Greene Foster, the principal investigator behind the seminal Turnaway Study, which followed women denied abortions. After Roe fell, leading more than a dozen states to ban abortion, that rose to 17%. While data suggests the post-Roe demand for later abortions is on the rise, the supply has not kept pace. Now that Boulder abortion clinic is gone, later abortions will be even harder to obtain. These procedures can make even people who support abortion rights uneasy. The US abortion wars are always volatile, but later abortions remain a uniquely explosive third rail. While 70% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in the first trimester of pregnancy – when a fetus tends to resemble a feathery sea creature – just 22% think it should be legal by the third, when a fetus looks much more like a baby. “The way that I conceptualize it is that, yes, if I didn’t intervene, often, this pregnancy would continue,” said Dr Diane Horvath, medical director of Partners in Abortion Care, a Maryland clinic that performs abortions up until 34 weeks of pregnancy. Every week, her clinic sees between six and eight patients who are at least 26 weeks along. “This is a potential life that I am taking part in ending, and I am completely comfortable with that, because the life of the pregnant person and their needs are always more important to me.” ‘Gross lack of understanding’ Only nine states even permit abortions after viability, the benchmark at which a fetus can survive outside the womb and which typically occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Just 17 clinics in the US provide abortions after that point. Only three routinely do abortions past 28 weeks; others do so on a case-by-case basis. The little research that exists on people who get later abortions has found it tends to happen to people who have discovered some late-breaking news – such as receiving a diagnosis about a fetal anomaly, many of which cannot be confirmed until later in pregnancy, or realizing that they are pregnant later than normal. Young people and individuals who used contraception when they had sex are especially likely to miss early signs of pregnancy, Greene Foster said. “There’s a really gross lack of understanding of what people go through and why they might make this decision to terminate a pregnancy later in pregnancy,” said Dr Jennefer Russo, executive director of DuPont Clinic LA, a Washington DC-based abortion clinic that offers the procedure until 32 weeks of pregnancy. “I’ve had patients whose partners have died during their pregnancy. There’s lots of different decisions that people could make in response to that event. But even just at the basic level of finances, if you don’t have the financial and emotional support of a partner, in this world being a single parent is really difficult.” There’s little room, however, for this kind of complexity in US politics. In the months leading up to the 2024 election, campaigners behind ballot measures to codify abortion rights drew the line at viability – and most of these measures passed. Meanwhile, Democrats rushed to capitalize on voters’ outrage over Roe’s downfall – but still acted like later abortions don’t happen. When Donald Trump insinuated in a debate that Kamala Harris supported abortions in “the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month” of pregnancy, Harris fired back: “That’s not true.” On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans have taken to equating later abortion with infanticide. “President Trump has told me that he wants to end late-term abortions,” Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, told senators during his confirmation hearings earlier this year. “I serve at the pleasure of the president. I’m gonna implement his policies.” (“Late-term abortion” is a medically inaccurate phrase, as “late term” refers to pregnancies that continue past their due date.) Horvath believes that more doctors and clinicians are now willing to perform later abortions; indeed, the overturning of Roe led to a surge in demand for abortion training. However, advocates say it is too difficult to get later-abortion clinics off the ground. “People just don’t have the resources to do it. We had to start a GoFundMe to begin this clinic. We solicited grants. We put in our own money to do this,” Horvath said. Back in 2022, DuPont Clinic announced plans to open up another clinic in Beverly Hills, California. The wealthy city is deep-blue, but the announcement was greeted by a ferocious uproar. Anti-abortion protests erupted, and DuPont’s landlord ultimately cancelled the clinic’s lease. California’s attorney general, Democrat Rob Bonta, accused Beverly Hills of violating state laws that protect Californians’ right to abortion. A lawsuit filed by Bonta’s office alleged that city officials had improperly delayed DuPont’s building permits as well as launched an “intense pressure campaign” against the clinic’s landlord, such as by claiming that the clinic would be so overwhelmed by violent protests and bomb threats that the city could not protect the public. Beverly Hills settled with Bonta’s office and agreed to train their employees in abortion law. However, city officials maintain that they did nothing wrong and did not try to block the clinic from opening. Russo is sympathetic to fears around harassment and violence. In 1988, somebody fired multiple shots into Boulder Abortion Clinic’s waiting room; in recent years, the front of the clinic was blocked from the street by a thick wall, while staffers protected patients’ privacy by using code words, referring to patients by numbers and placing phones in Faraday bags. In 2009, Dr George Tiller, perhaps the most famous later-abortion provider in the US, was shot to death in his Wichita, Kansas, church by an anti-abortion activist. “I’m worried about violence myself,” Russo said. But, she added: “If we all just decide that the Maga movement is violent, and we say we’re scared of them, and then we don’t stand up for civil rights or the rule of law, then they win.” Behind the scenes in Boulder The events leading up to Boulder Abortion Clinic’s closure are in dispute. Hern has said that the business had become unsustainable for several reasons, including patients’ inability to afford later abortions. “It’s a difficult situation, and I decided that I didn’t want to continue with this,” Hern said. “I have other things that I need to do.” Moreno, the chief operations officer at Boulder Abortion Clinic, said that plans for Hern to retire had long been in the works, but recently sped up as clinic staffers and physicians grew increasingly concerned about the 86-year-old Hern’s age and his ability to treat patients. Hern’s decision to close the clinic came as a surprise to her. Now, Moreno and other former staffers at Boulder Abortion Clinic are planning on setting up a new later-abortion clinic. There are two main obstacles, she said: they need to find real estateand the Trump administration has made donors skittish. “That’s a barrier that everybody in this space is up against,” Moreno said. Given Trump’s animosity to later abortions, “they want to be able to donate their money safely, where they won’t be audited, that their business licenses for their personal businesses won’t be held because of their donations”. Still, Moreno hopes to open up the clinic within 60 to 90 days, as the national abortion rights group the Brigid Alliance is helping fundraise. The need feels too great to wait too long. “The clinics that provide this kind of care were already overloaded,” Moreno said. Now that Boulder Abortion Clinic is gone, “they’re absorbing as much as they can”. This article was amended on 9 June 2025. An earlier version said that a dozen patients had to be rescheduled the week that Boulder Abortion Clinic closed; instead, patients set to receive abortions after that week had to be rescheduled. An earlier version also misstated Jennefer Russo’s title. She is the executive director of DuPont Clinic LA, not the chief medical director of DuPont Clinic.","2025-06-09T11:00:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/later-abortion-clinics-colorado"
"abortion","Stevie Nicks says Fleetwood Mac would have been ‘done’ without 1977 abortion","Stevie Nicks thrust herself into the ongoing fight for access to abortion in the US because she had “been there, done that”, the legendary singer-songwriter says in a new interview. “I tell a good story,” Nicks remarked in an interview conducted by CBS News Sunday Morning, a clip of which was circulated by the network in advance. “So maybe I should try to do something. “I was also there.” Nicks’ comments come after the release in September of her new single The Lighthouse, which was inspired by progressives’ battle to reinstate federal abortion rights in the US. She wrote the rock song after three US supreme court justices appointed by the Donald Trump White House voted to essentially overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that gave Americans a constitutional right to an abortion. In a recent Rolling Stone interview, Nicks discussed her certainty that if she had not gotten an abortion in the 1970s, it would have marked the end of the renowned band Fleetwood Mac that she ultimately helped launch to rock immortality. Nicks at the time had a contraceptive intrauterine device but nonetheless became pregnant by the singer Don Henley after breaking up her prior relationship with Lindsey Buckingham, her Fleetwood Mac bandmate, she told Rolling Stone. She said she decided to terminate the pregnancy in about 1977, or going into 1978, as Fleetwood Mac sat atop the world after its album Rumours. Rumours won Fleetwood Mac the Grammy for album of the year in 1978, a year that saw the band play 18 live shows in 11 US states. Three of the album’s singles – Go Your Own Way, Don’t Stop and You Make Loving Fun – reached the top 10 on the charts. Dreams, with Nicks’ vocals, went No 1 as Rumours eventually finished seventh on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. “Now what the hell am I going to do?” Nicks said to Rolling Stone about her thought process at the time of her aborted pregnancy. “I cannot have a child. I am not the kind of woman who would hand my baby over to a nanny, not in a million years. “So we would be dragging a baby around the world on tour, and I wouldn’t do that to my baby. I wouldn’t say I just need nine months. I would say I need a couple of years, and that would break up the band period.” Nicks, 76, said she doesn’t “really care” if people become upset with her over having decided to get an abortion. “My life was my life, and my plan was my plan and had been since I was in the fourth grade,” Nicks said to Rolling Stone, adding that Fleetwood Mac would have been “done” if she had decided otherwise. Nicks’ remarks to Rolling Stone about her personal experience with abortion elaborate on ones she delivered to the Guardian in 2020, when she said: “There’s just no way that I could have had a child then, working as hard as we worked constantly.” Meanwhile, after the reversal of Roe v Wade as Trump set his sights on a second presidency in the 5 November election, Nicks said she heard everywhere around her that “somebody has to do … [and] say something” to support abortion rights. “And I’m like: ‘Well I have a platform,’” Nicks said after the CBS Sunday Morning correspondent Tracy Smith asked the singer about the courage needed to “step into the waters of the abortion debate”. The result was The Lighthouse, a rare new release for Nicks, whose last album of entirely fresh material was put out in 2011. The single casts her as a lighthouse guiding women to campaign for their rights as voters choose between Kamala Harris and Trump, whose supporters include a conservative thinktank that is urging him to step up attacks against sexual and reproductive health and rights. “They’ll take your soul, take your power, unless you stand up, take it back,” Nicks sings on the track. “Try to see the future and get mad/It’s slipping through your fingers, you don’t have what you had/And you don’t have much time to get it back.”","2024-10-27T09:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/27/stevie-nicks-abortion-fleetwood-mac"
"abortion","Listening to the Law review – Amy Coney Barrett offers little comfort about state of US law","In June 2024, a divided US supreme court handed Donald Trump a get-out-of-jail-free card. Across 43 pages, chief justice John Roberts demolished the long-held belief that a president is not above the law. For Trump, who once bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, Christmas had come early. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, joined the majority but voiced doubt all the same. “Congress has concurrent authority over many Government functions,” she wrote, “and it may sometimes use that authority to regulate the President’s official conduct, including by criminal statute. Article II” – the constitutional provision concerning presidential power – “poses no barrier to prosecution in such cases.”. A year on, Trump runs amok, forever touting his enhanced powers under Article II. “A lot of people are saying: ‘Maybe we like a dictator,’” he teased recently. “I don’t like a dictator. I’m not a dictator.” Au contraire, his past self might’ve parried. Before returning to office, Trump said he would be a dictator on day one. Amid it all, Barrett plugs her book. At a recent forum hosted by Bari Weiss, founder of the Free Press, the second-most junior justice affected nonchalance. “I don’t know what a constitutional crisis would look like.” “I don’t think that we are currently in a constitutional crisis.” “I think our country remains committed to the rule of law.” “I think we have functioning courts.” When supreme court justices speak, utterances like “I think” and “I don’t know” convey more than a modicum of doubt. Barrett does not offer comfort. Listening to the Law is clearly written. Mixing memoir and civics, her book explains Barrett’s rationale for voting to overturn Roe v Wade, by which the court removed the federal right to abortion; tweaks Roberts for salvaging a pillar of Obamacare; and delivers a parting shot at Joe Biden. Back in 2022, when the court issued its abortion decision in Dobbs v Jackson, Samuel Alito (appointed by George W Bush) wrote the majority opinion. Clarence Thomas (appointed by George HW Bush) and Brett Kavanaugh (a Trump appointee) joined with Alito but also penned separate individual concurrences. Barrett and Neil Gorsuch (another Trump appointee), voted with the majority but otherwise stayed mum. Now, Barrett says Roe v Wade lacked textual support and political buy-in. Nor did time add legitimacy. For her, Roe (decided in 1973) was not akin to Brown v Board of Education, the 1954 decision that outlawed segregation in public schools, because the 14th amendment expressly secures the right to equal protection but is silent on abortion. “The Supreme Court redeemed both itself and the 14th amendment’s promise – albeit after decades of injustice – in Brown,” Barrett writes. “It’s impossible to say that a supermajority of Americans has traditionally considered abortion access so obviously fundamental to liberty that the constitution protects it even without explicitly saying so.” Time to turn to the numbers: “63% say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 36% say it should be illegal in all or most cases,” Pew Research reports. In 2022, in the first election after Dobbs, voters in Kansas embraced individual autonomy and reproductive rights. A year later, in 2023, Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky followed, even as Ohio and Kentucky remained Republican-run. Without mentioning Roberts by name, Barrett dings him for sustaining tax credits that underlie the Affordable Care Act, AKA Obamacare, hated target of the right for 15 years and more. Criticizing the majority’s reasoning in a 2015 case that upheld part of the ACA, she writes: “I was not on the Court when it decided King v Burwell. As a law professor, however, I wrote an article expressing the view that the dissent had the better of the argument.” If you want to get into the weeds, it was a matter of statutory construction. On a similar score, Barrett recalls Biden v Nebraska. In that 2023 decision, the court determined that the 46th president’s loan-forgiveness program lacked necessary statutory and factual predicates. Six justices held that Biden could not revamp the student loan program on a foundation of 9/11-era legislation – the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 – and Covid-19. Again, irony rears its head. Trump at the time praised the outcome, saying: “Today, the Supreme Court … ruled that President Biden cannot wipe out hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions of dollars, in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who paid their debt through hard work and diligence, very unfair.” Now, Biden v Nebraska may now doom Trump’s tariffs. Last month, the US court of appeals cited the case as it branded the tariffs illegal. “In this respect, the Government’s argument resembles the argument expressly rejected by the Supreme Court in Nebraska, where the Court concluded that Congress’s authorization to the Secretary of Education to ‘waive or modify’ laws and regulations governing student debt did not encompass student debt relief.” The case heads to the supreme court. Whether Barrett and the five other conservatives adhere to recent precedent is a live question. As a group, they appear to bend over backwards for Trump. Not surprisingly, Barrett has little to say about January 6 and the attack on Congress Trump incited, except to remind us that the supreme court unanimously struck down a Colorado law that would have barred Trump from the 2024 ballot as a result of the riot. As the court saw things, the states could not unilaterally enforce the anti-insurrection provisions of the 14th amendment. Then there’s Trump’s continued hints about seeking a third term. Questioned by Fox News, Barrett was predictably non-reassuring. Fox: “The 22nd amendment says you can only run for office for two terms.” Barrett: “True.” Fox: “You think that’s cut and dry?” Barrett: “Well, you know, that’s what the amendment says.” It wasn’t exactly a ringing rejection.

"abortion","‘I was crying, there was no anaesthesia’: the fight for legal and safe abortion in Nigeria","In a modest house on a red dirt road in Ota in Ogun state, Olayemi*, a 39-year-old auxiliary nurse, runs a small chemist shop. She treats common illnesses such as malaria and colds and sells painkillers, antidiarrhoeal medications and vitamins. For the past few years, she has also been selling packs of mifepristone and misoprostol, medicines included in the WHO essential medicines list to induce abortion safely. Both medicines are legal in Nigeria, a country with one of the world’s highest maternal mortality rates, but only if used to save women’s lives during obstetric complications. Olayemi does not stock them in her shop; instead when a woman comes asking for help to end an unwanted pregnancy, she has them delivered. On average, she gets three such requests a month. A mother of four, she has had two abortions herself. The first, 10 years ago, was self-induced with only misoprostol, the more accessible of the two drugs, but less effective if used alone. Complications meant Olayemi had to spend a week in the emergency ward of a Lagos public hospital. The second time, last year, she used both the pills she is selling and was amazed by how easy the experience was in comparison. Olayemi is one of about 20 women in the Ota community – chemists, nurses and tailors – who distribute pills for pregnancy termination in this rural part of the southwestern state. They share personal experiences of unsafe, painful or life-threatening abortions and a willingness to help other women. “The pain I went through, I don’t wish on my worst enemy,” recalls Alike*, 43, one of the network leaders, who, after 22 years of working as a teacher, resigned last year to concentrate on community organising and advocacy around safe abortion. “When I heard that there are drugs to induce abortion, that women can take in their own houses with the pain similar to menstrual cramps, I knew I needed to be involved.” Every year in Nigeria, where abortion is legal only to save a woman’s life, approximately 6,000 women die from complications related to unsafe procedures, accounting for 10% of pregnancy-related deaths in the country. In neighbouring Lagos state, the procedure is theoretically legal to protect a woman’s health, but the specifics of this legal framework remain largely unknown, even among medical professionals. On 29 June 2022, after four years of collaboration between doctors, lawyers and lawmakers, the Lagos state government released guidelines designed to clarify when a pregnancy could be dangerous and to provide a standardised approach for the medical sector. However, under intense opposition from religious leaders and in a year of federal and local elections, the guidelines were suspended a few days later on 8 July. The status quo remains, despite ongoing appeals from women’s rights and civil society organisations. In Ogun state, Eseosa*, 49, who has worked on projects combating maternal and infant mortality and malnutrition, created a network that trains and supports, ensuring access to information and pills within the community. They also collaborate with the Ogun state ministry of women’s affairs on advocacy initiatives, organising community-based seminars to raise awareness about the importance of safe abortion access, within the law. “Our main goal is to ensure that women have information on abortion pills, which really can save their lives, and we ensure that they have these pills in their hands.” Last year, Eseosa also opened a helpline called Ms Smart. The news quickly spread and in its first five months, counsellors received hundreds of calls from women seeking an abortion or help to escape domestic or sexual violence. The amount of gender-based violence recorded across the country is rising, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite a countrywide state of emergency on rape being declared in 2020, the number of rape incidents has increased every year since. In 2022, 65% of women in Nigeria said they had experienced rape in their life. Aware of the double cruelty of shockingly high levels of rape and laws forbidding abortion, Eseosa and her colleagues try to minimise the harm. “Before we refer women to our partners who help on sexual violence cases, we check if they are pregnant and ensure they are able to make informed decisions on their body autonomy,” says Eseosa. Eseosa’s motivation to create the network, unique in Nigeria, also comes from personal experience. When she was 18, she worked as a waitress in a hotel to finance her education and learned that rape was an integral and unspoken part of the job. She became pregnant after the first time she was abused and had an abortion in a private clinic. “I was crying and I was terrified. Ten girls were waiting in a tiny corridor. There was just a bed in the room. No anaesthesia, no antibiotics or checkups. I was sick for two weeks after.” Without help or any other work prospects, she stayed in the job, was raped again, and again had an abortion in the same clinic. “That was the only solution I knew then. If somebody tells me that women should go through such a terrible experience – now I know that there is a safe way – I’ll fight against them with all my strength,” she says with tears in her eyes. “I started the work because no one else was doing it.” *** In Lagos, women who want to access abortion often face similar situations. From her bed in the maternity emergency ward of Lagos State University teaching hospital, Vanessa*, 24, describes a clinic where she had an abortion 12 days earlier. “It was a small bungalow, hidden very deep in a dead end. No signs, I walked past it a few times before noticing.” After struggling with abdominal pain and not being able to eat or drink without vomiting for several days, Vanessa told her mother about her abortion and was rushed to hospital. Diagnosed with post-abortion sepsis, abdominal swelling and a possible life-threatening bowel perforation, she is awaiting surgery. “I just wanted it to be done as soon as possible,” she says of the abortion. “But in these clinics, some people know what they are doing, some don’t. It depends on who you know and if you are lucky.” Zara and Faith did not have abortions. Both are 18. Both became pregnant as a result of rape and, after being rejected by their families, were promised a place to stay by the only shelter in Lagos that provides support to underage pregnant girls. But only if they carried their pregnancies to term. Run by a Christian organisation, the Alabaster Jar Foundation, the shelter offers girls accommodation, food and clothing. Prenatal medical appointments, treatments, the delivery and first vaccinations for their newborns are also taken care of. Two months after the delivery, however, young mothers are left alone, encouraged to reconnect with their families or look for an alternative solution. Zara and Faith left the shelter with their newborns without accommodation, work or support. Zara’s extended family agreed to host them, but they struggle with a lack of basic amenities. The national campaign against rape is visible, and initiatives to change the perception of sexual violence, still often blamed on the survivor, are talked about in hospitals, homes and on social media. Multiple organisations, such as Mirabel Centre, WardC and Warif, partly financed by local and federal governments, provide medical, psychological and legal support to survivors, and training to doctors, police officers and judges working on cases of gender-based and sexual violence. For the past five years, on the first Saturday of December, crowds, including violence survivors, students and activists, have gathered in Lagos Island for an annual No Tolerance March. Followed by local media, people walk and chant feminist slogans while blocking the Lagos traffic. The fight for legal and safe abortion, however, is much less visible. “With abortion, we are fighting against the law and powerful religious beliefs. There is much misinformation, and we are combating years of stigmatisation. For now, we don’t even say the word abortion, and refer rather to safe termination of pregnancy, so that our stories are listened to and accepted,” says Eseosa. But there has been some limited progress. In May 2023, Ogun state’s government, where Eseosa works, implemented its guidelines on safe abortion, which extend legal exceptions to cases of rape, incest, risk to health and specifications around cancer and hypertension, positioning the state as the most progressive in Nigeria on abortion rights. In the meantime, women rely on one another for support. In her shop, whenever a woman in distress comes seeking help to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, Olayemi reassures her that she is safe, and provides her with pills. For now, she says, it is the best possible way: “There is so much domestic violence; women come and tell me their stories. Their men just come and go, want to have sex, but do nothing else. We are the ones taking care of ourselves and our children. So, we should find ways only to have babies that we know we can afford to take care of and educate. We need to find the best solutions we can.” *Names have been changed This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Howard G Buffett Fund for Women Journalists","2025-01-13T10:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/13/abortion-rights-nigeria-sexual-violence-women"
"abortion","Missouri supreme court keeps ballot measure to protect abortion rights","Missouri residents will vote in November on a proposed amendment to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, after the state supreme court ruled Tuesday the measure could be put to voters. The decision marked the culmination of a heated weeks-long battle over the ballot measure, which proposes to protect people’s “fundamental right to reproductive freedom”, including the right to birth control and to an abortion up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abortion opponents had challenged the measure as invalid, arguing that it violated Missouri law because it did not list the existing laws that it would repeal. The measure, they wrote in court documents, “is a proposal to repeal Missouri’s ban on abortion that does not disclose to voters that it will repeal Missouri’s ban on abortion. It illegally induces Missouri voters to do more than they wish to.” Missouri currently bans abortion except in medical emergencies. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the group behind the measure, collected more than 380,000 signatures in support of the proposed amendment. The group argued that abortion opponents are using a “novel” legal theory to kick the measure off the ballot and that a new amendment would not repeal Missouri’s old abortion laws but create a new one. “No recorded decision has ever accepted such a theory and used it to decertify a proposed constitutional amendment that was supported by the requisite number of voters’ signatures,” the group’s lawyers wrote in court records, adding: “Hundreds of thousands have exercised their power as citizens, and want their fellow Missourians to vote on whether to change the Constitution with regard to abortion rights.” Last week, a lower-court judge ruled to remove the measure but asked for a final ruling from the state supreme court. Still, on Monday, Missouri’s secretary of state, Jay Ashcroft, decertified the measure. In front of the supreme court on Tuesday, lawyer Charles Hatfield, who represented Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, told the judges that the decertification, although largely symbolic, represented “open contempt for your authority”. “It’s open contempt for the rule of law,” Hatfield continuing, punctuating his point by slamming his finger down on his podium. “It’s open contempt for the proper administration of justice.” Hours after the hearing, before an evening deadline to finalize the ballot, the Missouri supreme court ruled to let voters see the measure. The one-page order did not immediately include a majority opinion to explain the court’s reasoning. “Opinions to follow,” read the order, which was signed by Chief Justice Mary Russell. In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, voters in multiple states – including Michigan, Ohio and Kansas – have moved to protect abortion rights. Come November, nearly a dozen states are set to vote on abortion-related ballot measures, including Nevada and Arizona, two key battleground states in the presidential election. But as abortion rights supporters have latched onto ballot measures as a way to protect abortion rights, anti-abortion activists have launched new efforts to take them down. Nebraska, which bans abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy, is set to let its residents vote on two competing measures: one that would add the 12-week ban into the state constitution, and another that would restore the right to an abortion up until fetal viability. However, on Monday, the state supreme court heard arguments in lawsuits that aim to stop one or both of the measures from reaching voters, in part based on the argument that they violate state law by dealing with too many subjects. The court is expected to rule by Friday, the deadline for the Nebraska ballot to be certified. In South Dakota, a trial is set to begin on 23 September over a ballot measure that also seeks to protect abortion rights up until viability. That trial, which will begin after early voting is already underway, will deal with whether the signatures collected in support of the measure are valid. James Leach, a lawyer for Dakotans for Health, the organization behind the ballot measure, warned that the trial could be perceived by voters as a form of election interference, according to the South Dakota Searchlight. “They’re asking for something I hope makes a little shudder run through you, which is to declare that the ballot measure is invalid, and that no one’s vote should count,” he said.","2024-09-10T20:25:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/missouri-supreme-court-abortion-rights-ballot"
"abortion","Democrats introduce bill that aims to protect reproductive health data","Three Democratic members of Congress have introduced a bill to limit companies’ ability to hoover up data about people’s reproductive health – a measure, they say, that is necessary to protect women from persecution in the post-Roe v Wade era. Representative Sara Jacobs of California, Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon on Wednesday filed the “my body, my data” bill in both the US House and Senate. The bill aims to block companies from collecting, using, retaining or disclosing information about someone’s reproductive health unless that data is essential to providing a requested service. This provision would apply to information about pregnancy, menstruation, abortion, contraception and other matters relating to reproductive health. “Young people live our lives online, right? That includes tracking our periods, but it also includes our phones tracking our location and using Google to think about your medical care or how to obtain an abortion for yourself or a friend, or ordering abortion pills online, or using an Uber to travel to an abortion clinic,” Jacobs said. “All of those things are tracked online, and none of those are protected right now.” Law enforcement officials have already attempted to use people’s data trails to identify abortion seekers. In 2022, the year that the US supreme court overturned Roe, Nebraska brought a series of felony and misdemeanor charges against a teenager and her mother in connection to the teen’s abortion. The charges relied on Facebook chats, which the social media giant had turned over. (Both the teenager and her mother pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time behind bars.) In 2023, anti-abortion activists used cellphone location information to send anti-abortion messages to people who had visited some Planned Parenthood clinics. And in May, a Texas police officer searched tens of automatic license plate reader cameras, including in states that permit abortion, for a woman who officials suspected of self-managing an abortion. The post-Roe landscape is also creating more opportunities for online surveillance. In recent years, orders for abortion pills online have spiked, as tens of thousands more Americans have used online services to obtain pills to self-manage their own abortions. A number of women have also faced criminal charges over miscarriages, leading abortion rights advocates to worry that women who Google phrases like “how to get an abortion” and then miscarry could find themselves in law enforcement’s crosshairs. “It doesn’t deal with everything in terms of data brokers, but it does put women in a much stronger position to protect their rights,” Wyden said of the “my body, my data” bill. “Reproductive rights are the ultimate privacy priority, because the fundamental right of a woman to control her own body and her own healthcare is as private as it gets.” An earlier version of the bill was introduced in 2023. Given that Republicans control Congress, the bill is not likely to pass. “I have many Republican colleagues who say they care about data privacy. We work together on data privacy in every other area, but when it comes to anything abortion-related, they refuse to do it,” Jacobs said. “This is also the third oldest Congress in history, and I’ll be honest, many of my colleagues don’t understand how period-tracking apps or website searches or location data even work.” Jacobs says she uses a period tracker run by a company based in Europe that is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, a set of strict regulations that governs how businesses obtain and handle people’s online data. While the US has no similar regulations on the federal level, Washington state in 2023 became the first in the country to create a state version of the My Health, My Data Act. That law covers health data that is not otherwise protected by the US Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa) – including information about reproductive healthcare services – and requires companies to give their customers more privacy disclosures and seek their authorization before selling their data. It also gives Washington residents the ability to demand those companies delete their personal information. Jacobs advises people to use apps based in states with some degree of protection for reproductive health data. She added: “If you live in a state that is really criminalizing abortion and going after people, you should be careful about what you put online.”","2025-06-11T13:00:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/democrats-my-body-my-data-act"
"abortion","How the abortion bandwagon has proved a useful vehicle for political advantage","When politicians start talking about abortion law, it’s often more about the politics than the law. When this occurs in the heat of an election campaign, the likelihood of that only increases. Since Robbie Katter ignited the final weeks of the Queensland state election campaign with his talk of winding back abortion law under a possible future Liberal National government, similar talk has crept south and into the federal arena. A sudden intervention on the subject by the Northern Territory Country Liberal party MP Jacinta Nampijinpa Price sparked questions about a coordinated strategy among conservatives to put the issue back on the agenda nationally. Abortion, under specified conditions, is legal in all Australian states and territories. On Wednesday, Nine newspapers’ headlines suggested Price was seeking to revisit that, as she was quoted saying she couldn’t support abortion past the first trimester and calling full-term abortion – which statistics show is rare – “infanticide”. Almost before the breakfast coffee had gone cold, senior federal Coalition members – female – were out heading off any suggestion this was an authorised position. Rather, it was a personal view if unwelcome in its expression. “Federal Liberals have no intention of changing the settings when it comes to this issue,” deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, told Sky News, emphasising that abortion law was a matter for the states and territories. An hour later, shadow finance minister Jane Hume was reinforcing the message on the same network, declaring that abortion was a personal matter and any talk of change was being peddled by “fringe parties” in the Queensland election context. “It’s not going to happen,” Hume said. It had always been an issue of conscience in the Liberal party “and rightly so”. “There are some deeply held views right around the country and that is fine,” Hume said. “That’s why they call it choice. But what I can assure you and assure your viewers and assure all voters, is that a Dutton-led Coalition government has no plans, no policy and no interest in unwinding women’s reproductive rights.” Asked for her personal view, she responded: “I don’t see the need to change the laws.” Nationals Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, backed that in, saying she didn’t think Price’s statements were “helpful”. ‘The LNP has much to lose – or fail to gain’ Perhaps the most telling comments came later and from a bloke, who also happened to be a Queenslander and a normally strongly outspoken opponent of abortion. Senator Matt Canavan told journalists this was a sensitive issue and not an issue best prosecuted “in the heat of an election campaign”. “I don’t think there’s anything to be gained by playing it out in a tit-for-tat type process,” he said. In fact, for the LNP in Queensland, there is much to lose – or to fail to gain. Away from the election context, Canavan has not been shy about expressing his views on the subject. He has sponsored a private senator’s bill in federal parliament, the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, to force medical practitioners to save the life of a child born alive following a pregnancy termination. It sits awaiting a government go-ahead which will never come. The bill was co-sponsored by Victorian United Australia party senator, Ralph Babet, and South Australian Liberal senator, Alex Antic. They seem keen to move things along. On 20 August, Babet moved a motion in the Senate stating that Australia’s health system was enabling inhumane deaths through abortion and noting that “babies born alive as a result of a failed abortion deserve care”. The speakers in favour included Canavan and David Fawcett, another South Australian Liberal senator. A month later, South Australian state Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood introduced a bill into the state parliament aimed at banning abortion after 28 weeks gestation. With a Labor state government, and only a section of the Liberal opposition in support, it was also destined not to become law. But abortion has been a handy issue for the hard-right in South Australia. When it was decriminalised in 2021, hard-right factional players used the debate to launch a recruiting campaign and succeeded in filling party branches with new members, particularly conservative Christians. The Senate preselections of earlier this year bore the fruits of their labours, with Antic, a rightwing federal backbencher, wresting the top spot on the Senate ticket from the more moderate and far more senior frontbencher and former minister, Anne Ruston. The latest efforts to re-elevate abortion as an issue in South Australia are being seen by those not in the hard right as an attempt to repeat that successful factional endeavour. Federal observers of all these moves say the issue brings together the interests of the honest and the opportunistic – the true-believer anti-abortionists and those who see political benefit in taking a particular public position. When he introduced the proposed South Australian bill in September, Ben Hood paid tribute to Dr Joanna Howe, an Adelaide University law professor who has been campaigning for “babies born alive” bills across Australia. ‘Katter has set his sights on gaining more seats’ In Queensland on Monday, as the state campaign entered its final week before polling on Saturday, Robbie Katter announced that before seeking to have Queensland’s abortion laws repealed, he wanted them amended – to mandate care for “babies born alive”. It’s the same language used by like-minded Queenslanders and those further south but there’s suspicion in Coalition ranks about whose interests are being served. Katter has his sights set on gaining more regional Queensland seats, especially in the north. He isn’t a fan of the LNP. Neither is the Queensland Labor government. In late March, that government, under the premier, Steven Miles, legislated to allow nurses to administer pregnancy termination medication in Queensland. The move attracted significant public support and divided the LNP, whose leader David Crisafulli was pressed for his views and ruled out repealing abortion laws if he won the state election. Three weeks later, when Western Australia’s Labor government passed legislation removing legal barriers to abortion there, Steven Miles posted congratulations on his Instagram account under what looked like an advertising slogan. “Abortion is now legal in every state and territory,” it said. “Let’s keep it that way.” Fast forward seven months and Katter’s spontaneous reignition of the abortion debate in Queensland has enabled Miles to reinforce that sentiment. His poll figures have suddenly improved as he’s presented himself as the conviction guy, opposed to unwinding the current law. Having repeatedly refused to discuss his own personal position on abortion since Katter lobbed his molotov cocktail, Crisafulli was unable to avoid the issue in Tuesday night’s final pre-election debate. Pressed, he declared himself “pro-choice”. This came after video emerged on Tuesday afternoon of him telling a Griffith University audience last year that he didn’t support re-criminalising abortion but saying, when asked if he was pro-choice, that he didn’t support “late-term abortions”. The whole issue has sucked oxygen out of the LNP’s campaign in the final pre-election weeks. It may also have helped Labor stem a feared outflow to the Greens, with Miles’ sudden siren song of conviction calling back the deserting disillusioned. It’s certainly elevated Robbie Katter’s profile enormously. In politics, there are the true believers and the opportunists, and then those who are a bit of both. Sometimes it can be very hard to tell them all apart.

"abortion","Italy passes measures to allow anti-abortion activists to enter abortion clinics","Italian opposition parties have said women’s rights in Italy have been dealt a “heavy” blow after parliament passed a measure by Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government allowing anti-abortion activists to enter abortion consultation clinics. The measure forms part of a package of initiatives approved by Meloni’s cabinet that will be funded by the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund, of which Italy is the biggest beneficiary, and was put to the lower house in a confidence vote on Tuesday. The package of measures is expected to comfortably pass in the senate, too. The move follows measures already adopted by several rightwing-led regions in funding pressure groups to infiltrate consultation clinics, which provide women with a certificate confirming their wish to end a pregnancy. Some regions, such as Marche, which is led by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, have also restricted access to the abortion pill. Abortion was legalised in traditionally Catholic Italy in 1978 under legislation called Law 194. Although Meloni has promised not to change the law, accessing safe abortions in Italy is increasingly difficult due to the high number of gynaecologists who refuse to terminate pregnancies for moral or religious reasons. According to health ministry data from 2021, about 63% of gynaecologists refuse to perform the procedure. The deputy prime minister Antonio Tajani said that while the government had no intention of changing the law, “we must not criminalise those who are against abortion”. He said: “We have always allowed freedom of conscience on issues of this kind. I believe it is right for everyone to behave according to their own beliefs and conscience.” Elly Schlein, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party (PD), said the measure was a “heavy attack against the liberty of women”, while Silvia Roggiani, a PD deputy, said: “The right wing continues to display its nostalgic nature and obscurantist and patriarchal vision by trying, in every way, to erode women’s rights. It’s shameful.” Deputies with the Five Star Movement said Italy had “chosen to take a further steps backwards”. Before the vote, Jacopo Coghe, a spokesperson for Pro Vita, Italy’s biggest anti-abortion organisation, told the Italian media that the group had no intention of entering abortion consultation clinics. However, he said the clinics should “return to their original function of helping women find concrete alternatives to abortion”. He said Pro Vita’s main “sphere of action” was “public awareness and political influence with national campaigns”. The group is often behind controversial anti-abortion poster campaigns, including one in 2018 that labelled abortion as “the prime cause of femicide”. Luisa Rizzitelli, a women’s rights activist and the coordinator in Italy for One Billion Rising, which campaigns to end violence against women, said: “This measure might seem like a small thing, but symbolically it is very strong and serious – the government is giving a clear sign in that they want to do everything possible to persuade women to change their minds. This shouldn’t be happening.”","2024-04-16T17:06:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/16/italy-passes-measures-to-allow-anti-abortion-activists-to-enter-abortion-clinics"
"abortion","Australians must keep up the fight for abortion rights, Jacinta Allan warns","Jacinta Allan is warning that the battle for abortion rights must continue as conservative forces pose “real and genuine threats to the protections women have fought for and won” amid “frightening” debate in South Australia and Queensland. Victoria’s Labor premier made her strongest comments to date on abortion in an interview with Guardian Australia, just days before Queenslanders go to the polls in an election that has become dominated by the issue. “I am deeply concerned that things that women, and men, have fought for for decades – in terms of strengthening the protections around women’s right to choose, women’s right to control their reproductive choices – is being used as a political tool,” she said. “But even worse, there are real and genuine threats to the protections women have fought for and won. Legislation to protect their rights is being looked at being torn down at too many opportunities by conservative politicians.” Abortion has been fully decriminalised in all Australian states and territories. Medical abortion is available until nine weeks’ gestation, while surgical abortion rules vary from 16 weeks in the Australian Capital Territory to 24 weeks in Victoria. During the Queensland election campaign, Katter’s Australian party has promised to force a vote on a bill that would give registered health practitioners a duty to “provide medical care and treatment to a person born as a result of a termination”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The KAP leader, Robbie Katter, has said he would consider introducing stronger legislation depending on how many conservative Liberal National party MPs are elected on Saturday. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has been dogged by the issue for weeks and has refused to say whether he would grant his MPs a conscience vote. This month in SA, legislation introduced by a Liberal frontbencher to force women seeking later terminations to be induced, deliver the babies alive and keep them or adopt them out was narrowly defeated by 10 votes to nine. In Canberra on Tuesday the Coalition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price told Nine newspapers there should be a national debate on the issue and likened late-stage abortions to infanticide. Jane Hume, Sussan Ley and Bridget McKenzie – three of the most senior women in the Coalition – flatly rejected putting abortion on the national agenda, saying it was an issue for states and territories. Allan said events had proved the issue was not confined to the political fringes. “We’ve seen it in South Australia, in Queensland, this federal intervention from a federal senator … you look at what’s happening in the US,” she said. “The message that sends to women, it’s frightening. It says all that work that has been done to protect your rights, to support your choice, is at risk every single day from these conservative forces.” Allan said she would “fight for women to have their right to have their control over their bodies”. She acknowledged that there was more work to do in Victoria, despite it being a leader in Australia in terms of access to sexual and reproductive health services. “I know that, particularly for regional women, access to services can be a real challenge,” Allan said. A report by Women’s Health Victoria published on Thursday found that seven out of 10 local government areas have no surgical abortion provider and one in five have no medical abortion provider. The government said it had established 20 sexual and reproductive health hubs across the state, including in Ararat, Horsham and Melton – areas the report identified as having the highest rates of women seeking abortion. The hubs offer medical abortion care and referral pathways for surgical abortion. Endorsed midwives have also been given the power to prescribe medical abortions and make referrals. Work is under way to expand access to abortion in public hospitals, while Guardian Australia understands an announcement on the issue is also due soon.","2024-10-24T14:00:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/25/jacinta-allan-queensland-election-abortion-policies"
"abortion","Georgia judge strikes down state’s abortion ban, allowing care to resume","A Georgia judge on Monday struck down the state’s six-week abortion ban, ruling that the ban is unconstitutional and blocking it from being enforced. In a 26-page opinion, the Fulton county superior judge Robert McBurney ruled that the state’s abortion laws must revert to what they were before the six-week ban – known as the Life Act – was passed in 2019. The ban was blocked as long as Roe v Wade was the law of the land, but went into effect after the US supreme court overturned Roe in 2022. “When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then – and only then – may society intervene,” McBurney wrote. Abortions are now legal in Georgia up until about 22 weeks of pregnancy – the point at which Georgia permitted abortions prior to the Life Act. However, fetal viability tends to occur closer to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Although the Roe line of jurisprudence was supposed to prevent states from banning abortion prior to fetal viability, Georgia and several other states did so anyway even before Roe fell. Under the six-week ban, providers could not perform abortions if they detected fetal cardiac activity, which emerges at about six weeks into pregnancy. Many women, McBurney wrote, do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks. “For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability,” McBurney wrote. “It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a commander from The Handmaid’s Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could – or should – force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another.” In a footnote, McBurney added: “There is an uncomfortable and usually unspoken subtext of involuntary servitude swirling about this debate, symbolically illustrated by the composition of the legal teams in this case. It is generally men who promote and defend laws like the Life Act, the effect of which is to require only women – and, given the socio-economic and demographic evidence presented at trial, primarily poor women, which means in Georgia primarily black and brown women – to engage in compulsory labor, ie, the carrying of a pregnancy to term at the government’s behest.” McBurney’s ruling arrives weeks after ProPublica reported that two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, died after being unable to access legal abortions in the months after Roe was overturned. In statements after McBurney’s ruling, abortion rights supporters highlighted Thurman and Miller’s deaths. “We are encouraged that a Georgia court has ruled for bodily autonomy,” said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, a plaintiff in the case that led to Monday’s ruling. “At the same time, we can’t forget that every day the ban has been in place has been a day too long – and we have felt the dire consequences with the devastating and preventable deaths of Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.” Georgia’s attorney general, Republican Chris Carr, could appeal the case to the state supreme court and ask it to reinstate the six-week ban. The supreme court previously let the ban take effect at an earlier stage in the case.","2024-09-30T22:41:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/georgia-abortion-ban-overturned"
"abortion","Women of West Virginia: inform on yourself to the miscarriage police!","Avoid (having a miscarriage in) West Virginia “911. What’s your emergency?” “Hello, I would like to report the fact that I am having a very heavy period. Can you send a police officer over right away to collect my menstrual matter and check whether I’ve broken any laws?” The above is not a transcript of an actual conversation in West Virginia but, the way things are headed, it could be a glimpse of what’s to come. The Raleigh county prosecuting attorney Tom Truman recently warned that women who have a pregnancy loss in West Virginia could face criminal charges. To protect themselves, Truman said, women should call local law enforcement and report a miscarriage – which is the loss of a pregnancy before the 20th week. “Call your doctor. Call law enforcement, or 911, and just say: ‘I miscarried. I want you to know,’” Truman told the outlet WVNS 59News. Truman said he was personally opposed to prosecuting women who miscarry. But he warned that other prosecutors in West Virginia had indicated that they would be willing to file criminal charges against women who had lost a pregnancy via state laws related to the disposal of human remains. “I thought these guys were just chewing on a Dreamsicle,” Truman lamented. But, he added, West Virginia’s laws include definitions that are “pretty broad-ranging” and give law enforcement a lot of discretion to go after women who have had a pregnancy loss. To be very clear about the law: while abortion is all but banned in West Virginia, the pregnant person themselves can’t be prosecuted for having an abortion. Miscarriages also aren’t explicitly criminalized. However, law enforcement can get creative and use legislation that governs the handling of fetal remains to punish women. And this sort of “creativity” isn’t just confined to West Virginia: following the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, a lot of women who experience pregnancy loss in the US have been plunged into legal limbo. While it would appear that Truman was trying to be helpful, I should note that calling the police isn’t necessarily the best idea in a scenario where you have experienced, or suspect you’ve experienced, a miscarriage. “It’s always a mistake to invite law enforcement into your reproductive life,” Kim Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, told CNN. “I understand the idea that caution is better than being caught up in something that you weren’t anticipating, but it is difficult for me to imagine any circumstance in which I would think it was safe for someone who miscarried to call the police.” If you are going to call the police, you might want to quiz them on their understanding of the female reproductive system before going into any details. After all, how many of the men salivating over the prospect of locking up women for miscarriages do you think actually know what a miscarriage is? How many of them do you think understand that an estimated 23m miscarriages occur every year globally and about 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriages? Again, that’s known pregnancies: a lot of miscarriages happen before someone even realizes they’re pregnant. We don’t have the full picture of why pregnancy losses occur, but they are quite often due to chromosomal abnormalities. They are often, in other words, completely out of the woman’s control. And a very early miscarriage (also known as a chemical pregnancy) can be hard to distinguish from a period. Sometimes the only way to tell the difference is via medical interventions like a blood test or an ultrasound. All that said, this does strike me as a situation where a little malicious compliance wouldn’t go amiss. I’m not saying women in West Virginia should call up the prosecutor’s office whenever they’re menstruating and ask to speak to someone about the size and consistency of their blood clots or inquire whether they’d like to send a police officer to examine the toilet before they flush. Nor am I saying that women in West Virginia should drop off their used sanitary items at their local police station so they can be thoroughly examined by the powers that be. But I’m not not saying that either!

"abortion","If Trump wins the election, Idaho’s extreme abortion ban could go nationwide","When Jennifer Adkins and her husband were considering having a second child in Idaho, they vaguely thought how the state’s near-total abortion ban could affect them. But Adkins’ first pregnancy had gone so smoothly, she didn’t even use an epidural when she gave birth. Her next pregnancy, she expected, would be similar. But in April 2023, 12 weeks into her second pregnancy, an ultrasound scan shattered that hope. The ultrasound indicated a litany of issues with the fetus, whom Adkins and her husband had taken to calling “Spooky”, since Adkins’ due date was Halloween. Spooky, Adkins learned, showed multiple signs of a chromosomal disorder as well as dangerously severe swelling. Together, these conditions usually lead to a miscarriage or death shortly after delivery, Adkins’ doctors told her. And if the pregnancy continued, Adkins herself was at risk of developing life-threatening pre-eclampsia and swelling. As the mother of a toddler son, Adkins was not willing to take that chance. “I don’t think that you understand, until you are in that situation, how scary and how awful that actually is,” Adkins said during a recent interview at a coffee shop outside Boise. Under Idaho law, abortions are permitted in medical emergencies. But although Adkins’ health was in jeopardy, her doctors didn’t believe her case was enough of an emergency to legally end the pregnancy. They were too afraid of Idaho’s ban to even refer her to an out-of-state abortion clinic. So Adkins and her husband frantically called clinics in Washington, Oregon and Utah, trying to find somewhere within driving distance that was not booked up for weeks with other patients fleeing the abortion bans now blanketing the US. The couple also scrambled for financial support to pay for the procedure and travel. If they had to shoulder all those costs on their own, the family would be at risk of being unable to afford their mortgage. “We’re thinking about all these logistics when all you want to think about is grieving the loss of a baby that you really wanted,” Adkins said. “None of us feel good about making that decision. But it is a loving choice that we should be able to make for our family.” Adkins is far from the only woman to come forward to say she was denied a medically necessary abortion in the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions. Although these bans technically permit the procedure in emergencies, their exceptions are worded so vaguely that doctors across the country say it’s not clear when they can legally intervene. Fearful of the criminal consequences of violating bans, doctors are forced to wait and watch as patients get sicker and sicker – and then attempt to pull them back from the brink of death. As the home of what may be the strictest abortion ban in the country, Idaho is a cautionary tale about what can happen when the right to abortion disappears: droves of doctors have fled the state, which already had rising rates of maternal and infant mortality, and the state has become a laboratory for testing other laws meant to limit support for abortion patients. “Those opposed to abortion access and reproductive healthcare access have had a playbook for a really long time, and Idaho is a textbook example of their playbook,” said Jessica Waters, an American University professor who studies reproductive rights. “Everything that’s happening in Idaho is a playbook, I think, for what could happen in the rest of the country.” What a Trump administration could mean for abortion nationally If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, even abortion access for women in blue states may be under threat. Although Trump – who appointed three of the justices who overturned Roe – recently claimed that he would veto a national ban, he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue. And a Trump administration would not need Congress to wreak havoc on abortion access nationwide or to in effect ban the procedure. Project 2025, the controversial policy playbook for a future conservative administration, proposes using the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-vice law that outlaws the mailing of abortion-related materials, to ban people from shipping abortion pills. These pills currently account for about two-thirds of US abortions; they can also be used to safely self-induce an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Some anti-abortion activists believe the Comstock Act can do even more: if enacted to its fullest extent, it could not only ban pills but the very equipment that clinics need to do their jobs. Without ever involving Congress, Trump could use the Comstock Act to implement a nationwide de facto abortion ban. And if he doesn’t, the courts could: anti-abortion activists have begun to seed lawsuits throughout the country that cite Comstock, while the supreme court’s far-right justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, both brought up the 151-year-old law in recent arguments. Trump could also step back from enforcing a federal law that protects access to emergency abortions. Over the last year, Idaho has been at the center of the debate over this law, a debate that recently made its way to the US supreme court. The law – the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or Emtala – requires hospitals to stabilize patients who show up at their doors in the midst of a medical emergency or transport them to a hospital that can do so. But Idaho’s abortion ban only permits abortions in medical emergencies when a patient’s life is at stake – an exception, the Biden administration argued to the supreme court, that is so narrow it violates Emtala. Idaho pushed back, arguing in part that the federal government can’t compel doctors to offer care that is illegal under state law. The supreme court essentially punted on whether Emtala extends to emergency abortions. The justices restored a lower court order that lets Idaho doctors perform a broader range of emergency abortions, but left the door open to reconsider Emtala in the future. Without a Democrat in the White House to fight it, Idaho’s interpretation of Emtala could end up becoming a widespread standard. ‘These are not normal conversations’ Many doctors have left Idaho rather than work under its ban. In the 15 months after Idaho’s ban took effect, 22% of Idaho obstetricians stopped working in the state, according to a report by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative and the Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare. Three labor and delivery wards have closed. More than half of the state’s nine maternal fetal medicine specialists have left or stopped working in the state full-time. Dr Kylie Cooper is one of them. “It was a very real concern of mine that a situation would come up that somebody requires abortion care that I cannot provide, or that I am providing and at risk of being charged with a felony and going to prison,” Cooper said. “I lost a lot of sleep over it.” Cooper and her husband tried to game out the logistics of Cooper being arrested. Would she go to jail immediately? Could she get bail? What would that mean for their small children? Eventually, Cooper thought: “What are we even doing? “These are not normal conversations. These are not conversations that I ever anticipated having in my medical career, in my life,” she continued. “Thinking about myself and my family and my future patients, we made the really difficult decision to leave the state because of the bans.” She now works in Minnesota. In interviews by the Guardian with nearly a dozen Idaho-based OB-GYNs and family medicine physicians – two specialties that tend to handle pregnancy – over the last year, every one said that they had considered leaving the state, if not the country. Experts are still trying to calculate the impact of abortion bans on infant and maternal mortality, but one study linked a Texas abortion ban to a 13% increase in the number of infants who died in their first year of life. At least two women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, died after being unable to access legal abortions in their home state of Georgia, which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, according to recent reporting by ProPublica. Experts deemed both of their deaths “preventable”. Idaho has also sought to limit access to abortion in other ways. In 2023, the state created the crime of “abortion trafficking” when it passed a law banning people from taking minors across state lines for legal abortions if their parents had not consented. That same year, Idaho’s Republican attorney general, Raúl Labrador, issued a legal opinion claiming that Idaho law blocked medical professionals from even referring people for legal out-of-state abortions. Separately, Idaho professors and teachers’ unions sued over a law that makes it a crime to use public funds to “promote” or “counsel in favor of abortion”. . Courts have since blocked the abortion trafficking law and the attorney general’s legal opinion from taking effect, while dismissing the teachers’ lawsuit after Labrador said academic speech about abortion was not prohibited under Idaho law. However, four other states have since introduced abortion trafficking legislation. One of those states, Tennessee, has passed it. ‘It’s scary and it’s disappointing’ Rebekka Schaffner lay on an exam bed in an Idaho clinic, pale pink and blue straps curving over her pregnant stomach, as she listened to the rapid “whoosh”-ing of her in-utero baby’s heart. Because Schaffner’s pregnancy is high risk, the 34-year-old mother regularly undergoes tests to check that all is well. The threat of Idaho’s abortion ban, and how it may affect her life if the pregnancy goes wrong, weighs on Schaffner. She’s already felt the effects of the ban – twice. Last year, Schaffner had a miscarriage that left fetal remains inside her body, she said. Before Roe fell, doctors might have treated Schaffner with a routine procedure known as a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C – but Schaffner said they were too fearful of Idaho’s ban to perform the procedure. She ended up in the hospital with an infection, Schaffer said. “Had they handled it properly prior, I wouldn’t have gotten sick,” she said. Dr Loren Colson, a family medicine doctor in Boise, Idaho, said that abortion laws are so confusing, some medical providers are unwilling to treat miscarriages. When his own wife had a miscarriage, Colson said, a pharmacist refused to fill a prescription to treat it. “Even if it does seem clear cut, some people are like: ‘If the punishment is jail time, I’m just not going to do this,’” Colson said. When he’s working with patients, “if there’s any concern that a patient might need an abortion or might need a D&amp;C for stabilizing care, we don’t even come close to that line. We send them out to Seattle or even Utah, [which] has better laws.” When Schaffner realized she was pregnant again, she became profoundly anxious. “I didn’t want to potentially end up having another miscarriage and be right back in that position again, of being told what I could and couldn’t do, what was available to me,” she said. Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Schaffner’s cervix started to dilate, she said. Her doctors stitched her cervix closed to keep her from delivering too early, but the procedure carried a small risk of breaking Schaffner’s water too early. Had that happened – a condition known as premature prelabor rupture of membranes, or PPROM – Schaffner’s pregnancy would have been in effect over, because there would be no way for her to deliver a healthy baby. Complications from untreated PPROM can be deadly, but since Roe fell, many women have been denied treatment for the condition. When one Texan woman, Amanda Zurawski, developed PPROM, she was unable to get an abortion, contracted sepsis and ended up spending three days in the ICU. Other women have suffered life-threatening blood loss after doctors delayed treating their miscarriages. Should she develop PPROM, Schaffner said, she planned to go out of state for care. “It’s scary and it’s disappointing, knowing that if something went wrong in the process of trying to save the baby, that there wasn’t anything else they could do,” she said. “I would have to be sent to another state to have my daughter and lose her.” Adkins was ultimately able to get an abortion at a clinic in Oregon, a six-hour drive away from her home in the Boise area, in April 2023. An abortion fund helped her cover the costs, but being away from her home state and the providers who knew her was wrenching. As she spoke, Adkins started to cry. “It’s an incredibly cruel side-effect of these bans, to put bereaved parents through a loss like that.” In September 2023, Adkins became one of four women to sue Idaho over being denied a medically necessary abortion. Her lawsuit urges the state to clarify the scope of its medical exceptions, but it has not yet gone to trial. A similar lawsuit, in Texas, was shut down in May by the state’s supreme court. Adkins has since given birth to a second child. Afterward, Adkins got an IUD. “Now that the stakes are extremely high with this election, we decided to take a little bit firmer stance on how we were going to prevent pregnancy from happening,” said Adkins, as she nursed her infant. “I don’t know what kind of access to care I’m going to have.”","2024-10-21T11:57:39Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/21/idaho-abortion-trump"
"abortion","Kamala Harris decries Trump’s abortion comments in first solo TV interview","Kamala Harris sat for her first solo interview as the Democratic presidential nominee on Wednesday, laying out her plan to boost the middle class and condemning her rival, Donald Trump, on his comments over abortion. During the interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the vice-president painted Trump as a candidate focused on the rich at the expense of the middle class, and herself as better equipped to handle the economy. “The top economists in our country have compared our plans and say mine would grow the economy, [and] his would shrink it,” she said during the interview. On his economic record, Harris said: “Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet.” Harris also showed disdain over Trump’s comments on abortion, saying that he needs to trust women to make their own reproductive decisions. Her comments came after Trump, at a Pennsylvania rally, called himself a “protector” of women, claiming American women will not be “thinking about abortion” if he is elected. “Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they, rightly, should be able to make about their own body and future,” Harris said. On a lighter note, Harris confirmed that she worked at McDonald’s, pushing back against Trump’s allegations that she did not. “Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s who are trying to raise a family,” she said, alluding to her economic policy plan to help working-class families. “I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility, then, is to meet those needs,” Harris added. The interview comes at a time when Harris faces harsh criticism over the lack of media interviews she has done. Earlier this month, Axios reported that the Harris-Walz campaign has so far given fewer interviews than any other candidates in modern history. Trump and JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential pick, have used it as ammunition during their campaign speeches. On X, Vance responded to news of Harris’s interview by saying: “This is legitimately pathetic for a person who wants to be president. Ruhle has explicitly endorsed Harris. She won’t ask hard Qs. Kamala runs from tough questions because she can’t defend her record. If you want open borders and high groceries, vote for status quo Kamala.” In August, Harris was interviewed on CNN alongside Walz. The interview was hosted by Dana Bash and aired as a one-hour primetime special. After the interview, Republicans criticized the joint interview with Walz for being prerecorded and not live. Since then, Harris has given a handful of interviews, mostly with local outlets or more niche forums, including an appearance with Stephanie “Chiquibaby” Himonidis, a Spanish-language radio host and podcaster. Harris also appeared in a livestreamed Unite for America event with supporters hosted by Oprah Winfrey last week.","2024-09-26T00:51:21Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/kamala-harris-trump-abortion-interview"
"abortion","Cables and notes reveal UK view on Howard’s personality, Australia’s part in Kyoto ‘awkward squad’ and an aborted cricket match","Plus ça change. At the turn of the millennium, Australia was in the throes of “one of its periodic bouts of angst over its place in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world”. It was doubting the reliability of its ally the US, wrestling with the issue of Indigenous reconciliation, and attracting criticism for its lack of commitment to addressing the climate crisis. And it was trying to organise a game of cricket against the English. Just released papers from Britain’s National Archives shed light on intergovernmental correspondence between the governments of Australia and the UK before a prime ministerial visit to London in 2000 to mark Australia Week, and the centenary of the Australian constitution. Correspondence between the governments of the conservative prime minister John Howard and the UK Labour leader Tony Blair reveal a suite of problems still being grappled with in Australia a quarter of a century later. “Personality notes” written for Blair describe Howard as a leader who had “started well” as prime minister, particularly on gun control after the Port Arthur massacre, but who “appeared to lose his way” during his first term. Importantly for the UK, it saw Howard as an “instinctive monarchist … well-disposed towards Britain”. The sketch says Howard was a “strong family man”, significantly influenced by his wife, Janette, that he was a “fanatical follower” of cricket, and a “great admirer” of Sir Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi. In a scene-setting cable dated June 2000 prepared for Blair, the UK high commissioner noted: “Australia is going through one of its periodic bouts of angst over its place in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world”. It said Australia took “enormous national pride” in its intervention in Timor-Leste the year before (despite significant damage to its relationship with Indonesia), saying that the Australian-led peacekeeping mission “raised Australia’s stock in Asia”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email However, “critics argue that it simply hardened a view widely held in Asia that Australia is ambivalent, even antagonist, towards Asia”. Timor-Leste, the cable noted, had also strained Canberra’s relations with Washington DC. “The [US’s] perceived reluctance to assist Australia is seen as an indication that the US could not be relied on automatically in circumstances that are of little interest to it. “More broadly, some are doubting that the US will retain interest in the alliance unless Australia increases its commitment, in terms of defence spending. “The litmus test is Taiwan: having to choose between the US and China is the nightmare scenario on Australia’s strategic and diplomatic horizon. Few doubt Australia would choose the US but the calculations are becoming less clearcut.” In 2025, the US defense secretary has insisted Australia lift defence spending to 3.5% of its GDP, while Trump administration officials have demanded assurances from Australia it would support the US in any conflict over Taiwan. On climate, Blair was briefed that although Australia had signed the Kyoto protocol to cut emissions, it had not ratified the treaty. The British government suspected Howard would not raise the matter during the two leaders’ meeting. “If Howard doesn’t mention it, you should raise climate change,” Blair’s brief states. “The Australians are in the awkward squad on Kyoto (alongside eg the Russians and the US): you should tell Howard how important we think the issues are, and encourage Australia to do more.” In the quarter-century since, Australian governments have been consistently criticised internationally for failing to adequately address the climate crisis. A federal court judge last week found previous Australian governments had “paid scant, if any, regard to the best available science” in setting emissions reductions targets. Other files reveal concern within Blair’s government about an Indigenous delegation that visited the UK in late 1999. Leading the delegation was Patrick Dodson, a Yawuru elder and later senator, often referred to as the “father of reconciliation”. During the same trip, he met Queen Elizabeth II as part of a larger effort to foster reconciliation. However, a memo written by Blair’s foreign affairs adviser, John Sawers, reflects angst within the prime minister’s office about a proposed meeting with the delegation, referring to an apparent intervention by the then Australian high commissioner, Philip Flood. “The Australians are pretty wound up about the idea of you seeing the Aborigines at all,” Sawers wrote to Blair. “Their high commissioner rang me to press you not to see them: they were troublemakers – it would be like [the then Australian prime minister] John Howard seeing people from Northern Ireland who were trying to stir up problems for the UK.” The memo suggested: “Can’t we plead diary problems?” The word “yes” is written in answer to this, in handwriting that resembles Blair’s. A quarter-century later, Dodson was a key advocate for an Indigenous voice to parliament, put to Australians in a referendum in 2023. The voice proposal was ultimately defeated. Also within the National Archives files is a prescient document from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to the UK High Commission in Canberra. It reflects on a visit from a “rising star in the Australian Labor party and a useful contact for the FCO”. The “rising star” had reflected on Australia’s place in its region (and was summarised by an FCO official): “There were two main problems to Australia being part of Asia: a large slice of the region did not accept them, probably because of a common experience of European occupation – and Australia were too white; and Australians saw themselves as Australians rather than Asian, or indeed Europeans or Americans.” The visitor’s name was Kevin Rudd, the man who in 2007 would replace Howard as the next prime minister of Australia. As the 2000 Australia Week visit from prime minister Howard approached, a flurry of correspondence between the two governments sought to put the finishing touches to the trip. The files contain flight details, hotel bookings, and to-the-minute travel arrangements. There are discussions of trumpet fanfares and processional routes. One idea ultimately discarded was a cricket match proposed by Howard, to be played between Australian and English XIs at a ground near Chequers, the British prime ministerial country house. “The teams could, perhaps, consist of one or two current Test players, a recently retired great cricketer or two, with the balance being young players of promise.” Blair’s private secretary, Philip Barton, wrote in a memo to the UK prime minister: “I suspect the last thing you will want to do is go to a cricket match on the Saturday. But if we just say no, this would no doubt come out and you would look unsporting.” Barton proposed getting former Tory prime minister John Major, an avowed cricket fan, to raise an XI on Blair’s behalf, “but it may not be enough to stop the prime minister having to go to at least the start of the match”. A third option was to “turn it into a charity match”. The match did not go ahead.","2025-07-22T04:50:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/22/cables-reveal-uk-view-on-howards-personality-australias-part-in-kyoto-awkward-squad-and-an-aborted-cricket-match"
"abortion","Trump’s return to White House means abortion rights face new chapter of peril","Abortion, the issue thought to be the magic bullet that would mortally wound Donald Trump’s chances at a second presidency, instead failed to stop him on Tuesday. Now, two years after a conservative supermajority on the US supreme court ended federal protections for the procedure, the future of American abortion access is facing a new chapter of extraordinary peril. While seven states passed ballot measures to amend their state constitutions and protect abortion rights, Trump’s return to the White House means those hard-fought efforts may amount to nothing. Despite the gridlock in US Congress, a nationwide abortion ban could soon become a reality: anti-abortion advocates hope that Trump will resurrect a 19th-century anti-vice law to in effect implement a nationwide ban. Access to other forms of reproductive healthcare, such as contraception and in vitro fertilization, are also at risk. Because he’s barred from a third term Trump can now do whatever he wants without fear of electoral consequences, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the legal history of reproduction. “He’s playing with house money,” Ziegler said. “He can do whatever he’s going to do without fear of conservative Christian voters, without fear of swing voters, without fear of anybody. And he doesn’t have Roe v Wade and he has a conservative supreme court, so that means he could do really aggressive things to limit abortion or IVF – or not. We don’t know.” In the two years since the high court overturned Roe, abortion became an issue that seemed to spell electoral promise for the Democrats. Before Tuesday, abortion rights advocates had triumphed in all seven states that held related ballot measures. Public support surged, including in red states. But the outrage and activism did not translate into enough votes for Harris, who made defending abortion rights a bedrock of her campaign. Nor did Tuesday’s abortion-related ballot measures necessarily boost Democratic turnout in critical swing states such as Arizona and Nevada. Instead, exit polling by CNN indicates that almost half of people who believe abortion should be legal in most cases voted for Trump – the man who appointed three of the supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe and whose party spent decades dedicated to its downfall. Harris’s support among women also fell. Compared to Hillary Clinton, who won with female voters by 13 points in 2016, and Joe Biden, who won with them by 15 in 2020, Harris won with female voters only by 10 points. Trump has recently backtracked on his anti-abortion position – he recently claimed he would be “great for women and their reproductive rights” – as public support for the procedure has mounted, and it appears that some voters bought it. “Most Trump voters don’t think he’s going to restrict abortion anymore,” said Tresa Undem, a pollster who has been surveying voters on abortion. Part of the issue, Undem said, is that Republicans are not hearing about the impacts of bans, which are reportedly responsible for at least four deaths. Whatever the reason, the abortion bans now dotting the US map just did not seem to cost Republicans at the polls – a fact the right could view as an invitation to pursue a wave of new restrictions at the national level. ‘Outsourcing to people who care more’ Now, abortion access in the United States will largely depend on who Trump hires into his administration. “Historically, even in his first administration, reproductive issues were not the thing that got him out of bed in the morning,” Ziegler said of Trump. “And so a lot of the policy was outsourced to people who cared more than he did.” Project 2025, which was primarily crafted by the influential thinktank the Heritage Foundation but backed by more than 100 conservative groups, includes a laundry list of anti-abortion policies. It suggests rolling back the FDA’s approval of abortion pills, increasing CDC “surveillance” of abortion and pregnancy loss to police ban violations, and stripping federal funding from family planning providers that mention the word “abortion”. That last proposal may also severely curtail access to family planning services, including contraception and STI testing, for low-income people. Project 2025 also proposes using the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-vice law that went dormant when Roe was law, to outlaw the mailing of abortion pills, which account for about two-thirds of US abortions. Other anti-abortion activists say the Comstock Act can go even further and ban the mailing of all abortion-related materials, including the equipment used by abortion clinics. Such an interpretation of the Comstock Act, which could easily be taken up by a Trump Department of Justice, would result in a de facto nationwide ban. Deirdre Schifeling, the ACLU’s chief policy and advocacy officer, said that the organization is committed to fighting a revival of the Comstock Act. “We will fight with every tool that we have,” she said, “including litigation, including organizing, including people in the streets.”","2024-11-07T10:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/07/abortion-donald-trump-return-to-white-house"
"abortion","‘Gender ideology’, quotas and anti-discrimination laws on the agenda for Queensland LNP state conference","At this weekend’s state conference, Queensland Liberal National party members will debate banning gender-affirming care for children, repealing a ban on conversion practices and adopting a policy “whereby batteries, solar panels and wind turbines should no longer be deemed as renewables”. Seven separate motions reference “gender ideology”, gender-affirming care or transgender people, but the word “abortion” does not appear on the agenda for the LNP’s first convention since winning last year’s state election. Last October, party leader David Crisafulli became just the second modern Liberal elected as premier of Queensland to last longer than a week. Sign up: AU Breaking News email He used last year’s convention to announce his election-winning “adult crime, adult time” slogan. It became the centrepiece of the party’s small-target law and order strategy; the party has since legislated to sentence children as adults for 33 offences, in violation of the state’s Human Rights Act. Since winning he has urged the party to maintain a moderate face, and to steer clear of controversial social issues such as abortion, which was perceived to have hurt the party during the campaign. Last December, Crisafulli’s government passed a motion banning debate about abortion in parliament for four years. “We don’t exist for culture wars,” Crisafulli told the LNP state council last year. But many of the issues for debate brought to the convention by party units – effectively, ordinary members – reflect current battles within the culture wars. The party branch in Lytton has proposed that the convention call on the state government to “ban all gender surgeries and chemical drug treatments for persons under 18 years of age across all private and public hospitals”. The LNP’s women’s branch will also sponsor a motion along similar lines, calling on the state government to ban transgender people from using bathrooms corresponding to the gender they identify with, with an exception for children. The LNP health minister and former leader, Tim Nicholls, announced a ban on transgender children receiving gender-affirming care in public hospitals in January. The party’s Metro South region, representing southern Brisbane, will propose that the party ought to repeal elements of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 2020, a law which bans conversion practices. The branch claims it criminalises a medical practitioner “if they seek to identify or treat the underlying reasons for a child presenting with gender confusion”. The same branch will also propose that the party adopt a policy to “retire” anti-discrimination laws passed last year under Labor. Labor had been considering banning religious schools from homophobic or other forms of discrimination at the time. Implementation of the laws was indefinitely paused by the attorney general, Deb Frecklington, in March. It says that retiring the bill would “provide clarity for faith-based institutions to operate and recruit staff according to their values”. Metro South will also propose calling on the state government to welcome back health workers sacked for refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine during the pandemic. It will also argue for a motion calling on the state and federal party “to adopt a policy whereby batteries, solar panels and wind turbines should no longer be deemed as renewables”. The party passed legislation this year which green groups say restricts approvals of wind projects such that some coalmines have an easier approvals pathway. The bill also exempts Olympics venues from planning rules. LNP Women also proposed a policy of introducing a 50% target of male primary school teachers by 2035. The party has repeatedly refused to adopt a gender target akin to Labor’s for its elected ranks on the basis that it opposes quotas on principle. The convention is made up of ordinary members of the party, organised within party units such as the Young LNP, state electorate councils and federal divisional councils. It will be held from Friday to Sunday in south Brisbane. Motions passed are not binding on MPs or the government but determine general policy and indicate the feeling of the party’s base. The federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, will make a speech on Friday. Crisafulli and the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, will both make reports, as will the federal Nationals leader, David Littleproud. The party president, Lawrence Springborg – himself a former state MP and opposition leader – will step down at the conference.","2025-08-21T15:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/22/gender-ideology-quotas-and-anti-discrimination-laws-on-the-agenda-for-queensland-lnp-state-conference"
"abortion","Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood threatens US healthcare system, study suggests","Planned Parenthood clinics treated people who rely on Medicaid at more than 1.5m visits in 2024, new research published on Wednesday shows. But the reproductive health giant’s ability to treat those patients is now in jeopardy due to Republicans’ efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out of Medicaid. Donald Trump’s tax and spending package, passed in July, bans Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. After Planned Parenthood sued over the ban, a judge temporarily stopped it from taking effect. If the ban moves forward, experts warn that it could cripple the entirety of the US healthcare social safety net. “Planned Parenthood has filled a very important role in the reproductive healthcare safety net for people living on low incomes,” said Kari White, executive and scientific director at Resound Research for Reproductive Health. White was the lead author on the research paper released on Wednesday. “Other providers have counted on them to do so. They just don’t have the capacity to step in and fill the place that Planned Parenthood has had in the safety net.” In particular, White said, people will probably struggle to access contraception. After Texas started to ice Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program more than a decade ago, placements of contraceptive implants and IUDs – two of the most effective methods of birth control – fell by more than a third in counties that had a Planned Parenthood clinic. That indicated that those who had used Medicaid to obtain contraception at Planned Parenthood were no longer doing so. Provision of injectable contraceptives also fell; among people who used it, births covered by Medicaid rose by almost a third. Republicans have long sought to defund Planned Parenthood over the organization’s commitment to providing abortions. But Planned Parenthood does not rely on Medicaid to fund its abortion provision as it is already illegal to use federal dollars, including Medicaid, to pay for the vast majority of abortions. The 1.5m visits documented in Wednesday’s research paper, which was published in the medical journal Jama, only include visits for reasons other than abortion. More than 80 million people in the US use Medicaid, and 11% of female Medicaid beneficiaries who are between the ages of 15 and 49 and who receive family-planning services go to Planned Parenthood, according to an analysis by the non-profit KFF, which tracks healthcare policy. But defunding Planned Parenthood will probably hit blue states hardest, since they are home to larger numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries. About 50% of the people who visit Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties, which operates clinics in California, use Medicaid in some way, experts told the Guardian. If the defunding moves forward, the affiliate would lose roughly $50m, or half of its budget. It already went without Medicaid reimbursements for about five weeks earlier this year. “It was a really stressful time for my staff. They have fees and bills to pay. And some of them probably were wondering if they would still have a job,” recalled Dr Janet Jacobson, the affiliate’s medical director and vice-president of clinical services. “It’s hard not to take federal legislation that basically comes out and names you and threatens you and tries to defund you personally.” Jacobson is particularly worried about the future of a program at Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties that screens about 100,000 patients annually for sexually transmitted infections. Between July 2024 and June 2025, the affiliate uncovered more than 1,500 positive tests for syphilis, as well as almost 400 cases of trichomoniasis in pregnant women. Both STIs – which often do not have symptoms in their early stages – can have devastating consequences for pregnant women and their babies, such as preterm birth and birth defects. “They haven’t been able to ban abortion outright, so they’re trying to take away the money for services like cancer screening, STI testing, birth control, and essentially trying to shut us down that way so that we can’t provide abortion,” said Nichole Ramirez, senior vice-president of communication and donor relations at Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties. “They’re taking away this vital care from mostly underserved communities. They’re willing to have an increase in STIs, have a potential increase in cancer rates so that they can try to get rid of abortion.”","2025-08-13T15:01:21Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-planned-parenthood-healthcare"
"abortion","‘If Harris wins, it’s because of abortion’: election tests fallout from Roe reversal","Leslie Lemus’s top issue in the 2024 election is probably the economy. But she has a close second: “Them fucking with abortion.” Really, for the 26-year-old Arizona native, the two issues are one and the same. On Monday, she got an abortion at Camelback Family Planning, one of the last abortion clinics in Arizona, in large part because Lemus feels like she can’t financially care for a child right now. “I look at the world and it’s not very pretty. I’m not ready for that yet, to bring a child into the world right now, where the economy is not OK,” said Lemus, who said she lived paycheck to paycheck. Some months, she has to choose between making her car payments and paying off her credit card debt. “Everybody’s struggling left and right.” Lemus is registered to vote in Maricopa county, which is home to 60% of the Arizona electorate and may determine whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins the valuable swing state. Harris has made access to reproductive rights a key part of her policy platform – particularly as a contrast to Trump, who appointed three of the US supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade and who has toggled between branding himself as a champion of reproductive rights and as “the most pro-life president”. Lemus is a passionate supporter of Harris, who she calls “my homegirl”. Majorities of Americans have backed abortion access and Roe v Wade for decades, but it was rarely their top issue in the voting booth. Now that the US supreme court has overturned Roe, permitting more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions and several more to ban it at six, 12, or – as in Arizona – 15 weeks, abortion may become the deciding issue of the 2024 election. It is now the most important issue for women under 45, like Lemus. “If Harris wins the election, it will be because of abortion and women voting for her in large part because of that issue,” said Tresa Undem, a pollster who’s been surveying people about abortion for more than two decades. On Monday, Camelback had about 40 patients to see; at least one had traveled in from Texas, which bans almost all abortions. Visitors to the lobby were greeted by a sign urging them to register to vote while they waited for their abortion. The sign advised: “The health of our democracy is in our hands.” ‘That gives me hope’ On Tuesday, Arizona will become one of 10 states where voters will decide whether to amend their state constitutions to add or expand abortion protections. (In one of those states, Nebraska, voters will vote on both a ballot measure that could expand abortion rights and on the nation’s sole anti-abortion measure.) Five of those states, including Arizona, have some kind of abortion ban on the books. If any of the measures supporting abortion rights pass, it would be the first time that a state has overturned a post-Roe v Wade ban. Democrats have long hoped these measures would boost turnout among their base, but the rosy polling for the measures in steadfastly red states indicates that a significant swath of voters are essentially splitting their votes by supporting both abortion rights and Republicans, the party that helped engineer Roe’s downfall. Although the measure looks likely to pass in Arizona, for example, polling suggests that Trump will win the state. Julio Morera helped collect signatures at the Arizona state fair in order to get the measure on the ballot. His group’s booth, he recalled, was set up next to a man who was hawking rightwing memorabilia adorned with eagles, guns and the slogan “Don’t Tread On Me”. When asked to sign the petition, the man demurred. “I got customers to think about,” he said. But at the very end of the fair, Morera said, the man added his signature. “That gives me hope that this is gonna pass,” Morera said. “There are quite a few people that may not be Democrats or left-leaning who would support this access to abortion.” A vote for Trump, however, may ultimately cancel out a vote for a ballot measure. If Trump wins the presidency, he will be able to skirt Congress and use a 19th-century anti-vice law known as the Comstock Act to ban the mailing of all abortion-related materials – which would result in a de facto national abortion ban and render these measures’ successes moot. Project 2025, an influential policy playbook for the next conservative administration, suggests using the Comstock Act to at least ban the mailing of abortion pills, which account for roughly two-thirds of US abortions. It also suggests rolling back privacy protections for abortion patients and reshaping the nation’s largest family planning program, which would curtail access to contraception, among a bevy of other anti-abortion policies. Harris, meanwhile, has forcefully defended abortion rights. “Over these past two years, the impact of Trump abortion bans has been devastating,” she told a rally in Texas in October. “We see the horrific reality that women and families face every single day.” For Lemus, abortion bans all come down to one thing: “Men being in control of women.” The economy was not the only reason that Lemus sought an abortion on Monday.

At 18, Lemus gave birth to a son who was born prematurely and died just a month after birth. “I was there with all the medical stuff, seeing my child in the incubator until he passed away,” she said quietly. Eight years later, Lemus is not ready to have another one. “We fought so hard to have choices,” she said. “Why do they feel like we can’t have a choice?” Read more of the Guardian’s 2024 US election coverage When do polls close?

"abortion","Harris condemns Trump in Georgia after news of abortion-related deaths","In her first speech dedicated exclusively to abortion rights since becoming the presidential nominee, Kamala Harris spoke on Friday afternoon in Atlanta, Georgia, blaming Donald Trump for the abortion bans that now blanket much of the United States. Harris spoke days after news broke that two Georgia mothers died after being unable to access legal abortions and adequate medical care in the state. “Two women – and those are only the stories we know – here in the state of Georgia, died, died, because of a Trump abortion ban,” Harris said. She repeatedly referred to “Trump abortion bans” in the speech. “Suffering is happening every day in our country,” Harris continued. “To those women, to those families – I say on behalf on what I believe we all say, we see you and you are not alone and we are all here standing with you.” In the weeks since becoming the Democratic nominee for president, Harris has made reproductive rights a central part of her campaign. She has toured the country to highlight the healthcare consequences of the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, which paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions. On Friday, Harris blamed the former president for Roe’s demise because Trump appointed three of the supreme court justices who overturned the landmark decision. She also also condemned Republicans for repeatedly blocking Senate bills that would have guaranteed a federal right to in vitro fertilization, a popular fertility treatment that had its future cast into doubt after Roe’s overturning. “On the one hand, these extremists want to tell women they don’t have the freedom to end an unwanted pregnancy,” Harris said. “On the other hand, these extremists are telling women and their parents they don’t have the freedom to start a family.” The raucous crowd grumbled loudly at Harris’s words. “Make it make sense!” someone shouted. Although Joe Biden won Georgia in the 2020 presidential election, becoming the first Democrat in decades to take the state, Democrats seemed unlikely to recapture it until Harris replaced Biden as nominee. Now, Georgia is once again a swing state. Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina and a major Trump surrogate, has said that Trump must win Georgia if he wants to win the White House. Meanwhile, Harris in August embarked on a two-day bus tour of the state and giving her first major network interview there. The deaths of the Georgia mothers, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, were first reported earlier this week by ProPublica and occurred after Georgia enacted a six-week abortion ban. Georgia’s maternal mortality review committee looked at both women’s cases and deemed their deaths “preventable”, according to ProPublica. Although Georgia permits abortions in medical emergencies, doctors across the country have said that abortion exceptions are worded so vaguely as to be unworkable. Instead, doctors have said, they are forced to watch until patients get sick enough to legally intervene. After Thurman took abortion pills to end a pregnancy in 2022, her body failed to expel all of the fetal tissue – a rare but potentially devastating complication. Doctors delayed giving the 28-year-old a routine procedure for 20 hours, and she developed sepsis. Her heart stopped during an emergency surgery. “Under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed,” Harris said on Friday. “Understand what a law like this means. Doctors have to wait until the patient is at death’s door before they take action.” Harris met with Thurman’s mother and sisters on Thursday night. “Their pain is heartbreaking,” she said. While on the campaign trail, Trump has alternated between bragging about helping to demolish Roe, complaining about how Republicans’ hardline anti-abortion stances have cost the Republican elections, and flip-flopping on his own position on the procedure. Access to abortion has become one of voters’ top issues over the last two years, and Democrats are hoping that outrage over Roe will propel them to victory at the ballot box this November. Ten states, including the key battleground states of Nevada and Arizona, are set to hold abortion-related ballot measures, which could boost turnout among Democrats’ base.","2024-09-20T20:25:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-harris-election-abortion-georgia"
"abortion","Kamala Harris attacks Trump over ‘immoral’ abortion bans at Wisconsin rally","Kamala Harris campaigned in Madison, Wisconsin, the deep blue capital of the state and college town that Democrats hope will turn out enough voters to turn the election in the presidential nominee’s favor. “We know this is gonna be a tight race until the very end,” said Harris. “We are the underdog in this race, and we have some hard work ahead of us.” Wisconsin voters delivered razor-thin margins during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by about 22,000 votes, and in 2020 Joe Biden scraped by with just 20,000 more than Trump. Polling in Wisconsin so far shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck. Three polls conducted this week underscore just how tight the race could be here: polling by AARP, Marist and Quinnipiac University suggest the race is virtually tied here, with Harris leading Trump by just one point in each. On the trail, Harris has emphasized her support for abortion rights, a centerpiece of her campaign and a galvanizing issue for young voters. “It is immoral,” said Harris of the numerous abortion bans that were implemented after Roe v Wade was overturned. “Let us agree one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do.” Harris described meeting with the mother of a young woman who died of sepsis after being denied abortion care in Georgia. “Amber Nicole Thurman,” said Harris. “I promised her mother I would say her name every time.” Whoever wins Wisconsin’s popular vote earns the state’s full 10 electoral votes, giving the state a disproportionate say over the presidential election, and groups such as Madison’s large college-age population will play a critical role in deciding the result. Some of those students attended the Friday rally. “It’s just so nice to see someone who’s actually joyful,” said Kaitlin Olson, a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. During Biden’s painful debate performance against Trump, Olson said, “it was like, ‘This is scary.’ Now that Kamala is running, I’m like, ‘OK, a little more joy.’” “I think we’re gonna turn out higher than expected,” said Jake Leismer, a college freshman who took the bus from campus, joining up with Olson and a group of students at the rally. The Democratic-coordinated campaign, which supports Democrats up and down the ballot, has hired seven full-time campus organizers across the state and a youth organizing coordinator, according to a source familiar with the Harris campaign’s staffing operations in Wisconsin. Kelly Conner, a campus organizer based in Madison, said the campaign has been met with enthusiasm – even hosting a bonfire to ceremonially burn copies of Wisconsin’s gerrymandered electoral maps, which the state abandoned this year after years of progressive and Democratic party organizing. “We have lots of volunteers that have never volunteered before that want to get out and knock doors,” said Conner. The young-people effect in Wisconsin came to light fully in 2023, when college students turned out in droves to elect Janet Protasiewicz to the Wisconsin supreme court, creating a liberal majority on the bench. At the heart of the race was abortion access, which has been caught in a legal snarl since the fall of Roe v Wade triggered a 175-year-old ban in the state. “They know the stakes,” said Conner. “This election is about fascism versus democracy, and students are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump never sets foot in the White House again.”","2024-09-21T00:07:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/kamala-harris-trump-abortion-wisconsin"
"abortion","Contested state supreme court seats are site of hidden battle for abortion access","Abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states on Tuesday, and it’s one of the top issues in the presidential contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. But it is also key to less publicized but increasingly contested races for seats on state supreme courts, which often have the last word on whether a state will ban or protect access to the procedure. This year, voters in 33 states have the chance to decide who sits on their state supreme courts. Judges will be on the ballot in Arizona and Florida, where supreme courts have recently ruled to uphold abortion bans. They are also up for election in Montana, where the supreme court has backed abortion rights in the face of a deeply abortion-hostile state legislature. In addition, supreme court judges are on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and Nevada – all of which are holding votes on measures that could enshrine access to abortion in their state constitutions. Should those measures pass, state supreme courts will almost certainly determine how to interpret them. Indeed, anti-abortion groups are already gearing up for lawsuits. “We’re all going to end up in court, because they’re going to take vague language from these ballot initiatives to ask for specific things like funding for all abortions, abortion for minors without parental consent,” said Kristi Hamrick, chief media and policy strategist for the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, which is currently campaigning around state supreme court races in Arizona and Oklahoma. “Judges have become a very big, important step in how abortion law is actually realized.” In Michigan and Ohio, which voted in 2022 and 2023 respectively to amend their state constitution to include abortion rights, advocates are still fighting in court over whether those amendments can be used to strike down abortion restrictions. Come November, however, the ideological makeup of both courts may flip. Spending in state supreme court races has surged since Roe fell. In the 2021-2022 election cycle, candidates, interest groups and political parties spent more than $100m, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. After adjusting for inflation, that’s almost double the amount spent in any previous midterm cycle. In 2023, a race for a single seat on the Wisconsin supreme court alone cost $51m – and hinged on abortion rights, as the liberal-leaning candidate talked up her support for the procedure. (As in many other – but not all – state supreme court races, the candidates in Wisconsin were technically non-partisan.) After that election, liberals assumed a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin supreme court. The court is now set to hear a case involving the state’s 19th-century abortion ban, which is not currently being enforced but is still on the books. It’s too early to tally up the money that has been dumped into these races this year, especially because much of it is usually spent in the final days of the election. But the spending is all but guaranteed to shatter records. In May, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Planned Parenthood Votes announced that they were teaming up this cycle to devote $5m to ads, canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts in supreme court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas. Meanwhile, the ACLU and its Pac, the ACLU Voter Education Fund, has this year spent $5.4m on non-partisan advertising and door-knocking efforts in supreme court races in Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio. The scale of these investments was unprecedented for both Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, according to Douglas Keith, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Judiciary Program who tracks supreme court races.

Get our free app and sign up for election alerts “For a long time, judicial campaign ads often were just judges saying that they were fair and independent and had family values, and that was about it. Now, you’re seeing judges talk about abortion rights or voting rights or environmental rights in their campaign ads,” Keith said. By contrast, rightwing judicial candidates are largely avoiding talk of abortion, Keith said, as the issue has become ballot box poison for Republicans in the years since Roe fell. Still, the Judicial Fairness Initiative, the court-focused arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, announced in August that it would make a “seven-figure investment” in judicial races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas. Balancing the federal bench Abortion is far from the only issue over which state courts hold enormous sway. They also play a key role in redistricting, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and more. And with the US Congress so gridlocked, state-level legislation and its legality has only grown in importance. For years, conservative operatives have focused on remaking the federal judiciary in their ideological image – an effort that culminated in Donald Trump’s appointments of three US supreme court justices and has made federal courts generally more hostile to progressive causes. Now, the ACLU hopes to make state supreme courts into what Deirdre Schifeling, its chief political and advocacy officer, calls a “counterbalance” to this federal bench. “We have a plan through 2030 to work to build a more representative court,” said Schifeling, who has a spreadsheet of the supreme court races that will take place across eight states for years to come. (As a non-partisan organization, the ACLU focuses on voter education and candidates’ “civil rights and civil liberties” records.) This cycle, the organization’s messaging has centered on abortion. “Nationally, you’re seeing polling that shows the top thing that voters are voting on is the economy. But these judges don’t really influence the economy,” Schifeling said. “Of the issues that they can actually influence and have power over, reproductive rights is by far the most important to voters.” Abortion rights supporters are testing out this strategy even in some of the United States’ most anti-abortion states. In Texas, where ProPublica this week reported two women died after being denied emergency care due to the state’s abortion ban, former US air force undersecretary Gina Ortiz Jones has launched the Find Out Pac, which aims to unseat three state supreme court justices. Justices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine, the Pac has declared, “fucked around with our reproductive freedom” in cases upholding Texas’s abortion restrictions. Now, Jones wants them out. “Why would we not try to hold some folks accountable?” Jones said. “This is the most direct way in which Texas voters can have their voices heard on this issue.” (There is no way for citizens to initiate a ballot measure in Texas.) The Pac has been running digital ads statewide on how the Texas ban has imperiled access to medically necessary care. However, since state supreme court races have long languished in relative obscurity, voters don’t always know much about them and may very well default to voting on party lines in the seven states where the ballots list the affiliations of nominees for the bench. Although the majority of Texans believe abortions should be legal in all or some cases, nearly half of Texans don’t recall seeing or hearing anything about their supreme court in the last year, according to Find Out Pac’s own polling. “This conversation that we’re having in Texas, around the importance of judicial races, is new for us as Democrats,” Jones said. “It’s not for the Republicans.”","2024-11-02T12:00:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/state-supreme-court-abortion-ballot"
"abortion","Crisafulli wedged on abortion as Katter party flags vote to criminalise terminations","The Queensland crossbencher Robbie Katter says he will consider forcing a vote on the recriminalisation of abortion if the Liberal National party wins government at this month’s state election. Katter says he will table legislation to wind back current laws with one option a “clean repeal” of Labor’s 2018 Termination of Pregnancy Act, a move that would return abortion to the 1899 criminal code. Amid growing controversy, with two LNP MPs supportive of changes to the current laws, the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, was repeatedly asked about the issue on Wednesday. But he remained tight-lipped on the prospect of a conscience vote for his MPs – and on his personal views on the issue. “It’s not part of our plan” and “there’ll be no change”, he repeatedly said as he campaigned in Townsville. Crisafulli voted against the 2018 legalisation. Katter, the Katter’s Australian party leader, introduced a bill last parliament to ban “partial birth” abortion, but it lapsed before going to a vote. On Tuesday he declared he would introduce another abortion bill, but gave few details. Katter told Guardian Australia he would determine how strong to make his private members’ bill based on how many conservative LNP members were elected. In case of an LNP landslide, he would aim for a 16-week limit, if not a “clean repeal” of the 2018 bill, he said. “All I could say is, everything will be on the table because we’re very serious about our position on this,” he said. “So we would be looking to wind back as much as we could.” The last Queenslander to be prosecuted for getting an abortion beat the charge in 2010. At the time, women needed to prove they had a reasonable belief it was necessary to protect the woman’s physical or mental wellbeing. ‘Back to the dark ages’ Jill McKay, the CEO of Children by Choice, said a repeal of the 2018 act would cause clinics to close and force many women to “flee the border” into New South Wales. “If we don’t have the Termination of Pregnancy Act in place, then we return back to the dark ages,” McKary said. “[There is] complete concern that women and pregnant people and children that chose to end a pregnancy by abortion could be charged.” The premier, Steven Miles, said his party would be granted a conscience vote – but would all vote no on any bill. “It’s been our long-held practice to have a conscience vote on those matters, but you know what our conscience says. Labor MPs support a women’s right to choose. And you know what the LNP MPs’ consciences say too; they are overwhelmingly opposed to a woman’s right to choose.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Miles pointed out that all LNP MPs voted against a bill allowing nurses to prescribe the medical abortion drug MS-2 Step. “We know that there will be a bill next term and MPs should tell their constituents, or candidates should tell voters how they would vote on that bill,” Miles said. Public remarks by a series of LNPs MPs backing a repeal bill have been reported in recent days. The Australian newspaper revealed this week that the Scenic Rim MP Jon Krause told a candidates’ forum that “we need to ensure that there are enough people in the parliament to be able to repeal those laws or to make significant amendments”. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson told a Christian podcast in August there “are no doubt corrections that will happen over time”. “I see our values are very firmly anchored in family values,” Robinson said. “And when I go to state council – and I cannot talk about the fine detail of some of that – our policies are very much a broad suite of family values. “And so I think that, as we go forward, I think people would expect that whatever the future government faces, whatever comes up in that time, it would need to reference it back to what those family policies of the party and the general expectations of Queenslanders are. That’s how I think [changes to abortion laws] will be framed.” The LNP has not responded to requests by groups – including pro-choice advocates and the Christian lobby – to make clear its position.","2024-10-09T07:04:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/09/queensland-state-election-abortion-rights-lnp-policy-law-changes-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Florida threatens news stations over ad in favor of abortion rights measure","The Florida health department has fired off cease-and-desist letters to local news stations over an advertisement urging people to vote in favor of a ballot measure that would expand abortion rights in the state. In the ad, a woman identified as Caroline from Tampa, Florida, talks about being diagnosed with brain cancer while pregnant. The state currently bans abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy. “The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,” she says. “Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.” She then urges viewers to vote “yes” on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and restore access to the procedure, which was dramatically curtailed when the six-week ban went into effect in May of this year. John Wilson, general counsel for the Florida department of health, called the claim that women can’t get life-saving abortions in Florida “categorically false” in letters to local news stations, which were first reported by the journalist Jason Garcia and the news outlet Florida Politics. “The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,” Wilson wrote. “Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial and irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.” Although Florida, like every other state with an abortion ban, permits abortions in cases of medical emergencies, doctors across the country have said that these bans are worded so vaguely and with such little regard for medical realities that they are unworkable in practice. Instead, doctors facing the threat of criminal prosecution for violating the bans say they have been forced to delay women’s care until they are sick enough. On Tuesday, Jessica Rosenworcel, the Federal Communications Commission chair, condemned the cease-and-desist letters. “The right of broadcasters to speak freely is rooted in the first amendment,” Rosenworcel said in a statement. “Threats against broadcast stations for airing content that conflicts with the government’s views are dangerous and undermine the fundamental principle of free speech.” Dozens of women have come forward with stories of being denied medically necessary abortions. In August, a New York state doctor told the Guardian that she had treated a woman with an ectopic pregnancy – which is nonviable and potentially life-threatening if left untreated – who had been turned away from a Florida emergency department. Over the last several weeks, civil rights and fair election groups have become increasingly alarmed by efforts by Florida’s rightwing government – led by its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis – to undermine the state’s ballot measure. Law enforcement officials have investigated voters who signed a petition to get the measure onto the ballot, while a state agency has posted a website attacking the measure. Abortion-related ballot measures have passed in a number of states since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, but Florida’s measure needs to garner 60% of the vote to pass – and the support for the measure currently appears to be well short of that threshold, a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found. Nine other states are also set to vote on abortion-related ballot measures on election day in November.","2024-10-09T19:37:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/florida-news-abortion-ballot-coverage"
"abortion","Robbie Katter to ‘test the parliament’ on abortion as Queensland election count continues ","The Queensland cross-bench MP, Robbie Katter, says he thinks Liberal National party candidates who made anti-abortion comments prior to the state election were “dog whistling” but have little intention of deviating from the party line. The Katter’s Australian party leader told ABC Radio National on Tuesday that he would still seek to “test the parliament” on a potential private member’s bill to wind back some elements of Queensland’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. The KAP MP’s vow to do so during the state election campaign turned abortion rights into a significant issue, credited with helping Labor to prevent the loss of more seats in Brisbane and its surrounds. The incoming Crisafulli government has said it has “no plans” to reform the laws and that there will be “no changes”. But if Katter brings a private member’s bill, the longstanding LNP practice is to hold a conscience vote. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Several LNP MPs – including Tony Perrett and Jon Krause – said early in the campaign they either opposed the laws, or might attempt to repeal them. During the last parliament, Katter tabled a “babies born alive” bill that would mandate life-saving interventions on the extremely rare occasions where an unviable foetus is born alive. Healthcare professionals say claims by anti-choice lobby groups about the situation amount to misinformation. Katter told the ABC that he had been asked if he would consider a private member’s bill and said “of course I would, that’s what we do … and it blew up from there”. “I haven’t worked that out [what a bill might look like] I’m sorry we can’t give you more detail. I got pulled into the debate, and all I can say is we will be testing the parliament on it.” But Katter said he was sceptical that LNP MPs, including those previously on-record supporting reform, would support his bill. “I think they were all dog whistling. Some of the motivation behind it is all these people going around trying to pretend they’ve got values in one direction when they’ve got no intention of voting against their party, or knowing that a conscience vote isn’t really a conscience vote.” LNP sources say the party is “acutely aware” that it had not made inroads into Brisbane electorates to the same extent as the regions, and that the new premier, David Crisafulli, would focus on putting forward a modern-looking government. “The sorts of scare campaigns that have been run hark back to a version of the party that is not David’s version,” a party source said. “In four years’ time, Labor won’t have abortion, it won’t have Campbell Newman. It won’t have much at all.” Counting continued in up to 10 seats that remain in the balance after Saturday’s election. Labor appears to have taken a narrow lead in Pine Rivers, where outgoing minister Nikki Boyd had earlier been in trouble. The count in Gaven, on the northern Gold Coast, has also narrowed. Labor’s housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, is considered the party’s rising star and is fighting off a challenge from former TV reporter Bianca Stone. Scanlon’s lead on election night has been cut to an estimated 290 votes and the seat remains too close to call.","2024-10-29T04:24:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/29/queensland-election-lnp-kap-robbie-katter-abortion-policy-crisafulli"

"abortion","RFK Jr and health agency falsely claim MMR vaccine includes ‘aborted fetus debris’","Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and his department have made a series of misleading statements that alarmed vaccine experts and advocates in recent days – including that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. Health department officials released statements saying they could alter vaccine testing and build new “surveillance systems” on Wednesday, both of which have unnerved experts who view new placebo testing as potentially unethical. “It’s his goal to even further lessen trust in vaccines and make it onerous enough for manufacturers that they will abandon it,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, about the statements and Kennedy. “It’s a fragile market.” In this same week, Kennedy exhorted parents to “do their own research” in a talkshow interview – the phrase has become pop culture shorthand for a shallow internet search that casts people into the arms of the disinformation ecosystem. “All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”. The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems. Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for prolific misinformation. He also earned money by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers. Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post. Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using decades-old sterile fetal cell lines derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s. Vaccines against new pathogens, such as Covid-19, are placebo tested. However, experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines, for instance measles, to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease. “No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he’s asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit. Although Kennedy has made false and misleading statements about vaccines generally, the Covid-19 vaccine appears to be especially in the administration’s crosshairs. In response to recent questions about Covid-19 strategy from the Guardian, the administration responded: “The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.” Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be flagged to Kennedy’s office. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an $11bn clawback in grants from states. Most controversially, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed expected approval of a new Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, reportedly on the review of a political appointee known to be skeptical of vaccines. Over the weekend, FDA commissioner Marty Makary addressed the delay by describing annual updates to the vaccine’s strains as a “new” product, creating confusion about whether vaccine makers have to conduct new safety and efficacy trials. Such trials would not be a normal part of routine updates. On Monday, the company released a statement that said in part the FDA had demanded a clinical trial as part of post-approval surveillance, and that it would continue to work with the FDA.","2025-05-01T14:18:22Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim"
"abortion","Monday briefing: What Nigel Farage’s new obsession with nativism could mean for the UK","Good morning. In 2023, Nigel Farage went on a podcast to decry what he described as a culture of “welfarism” in the UK, insisting it was making millions of people in the country lazy. “‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’,” he said. “‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it.” Less than two years later, the self-styled free-market crusader seems to be singing a different tune. Last week, he publicly backed the removal of the two-child benefit cap – a move that would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and ease hardship for 700,000 more. So, what changed? At a press conference, he explained that removing the cap would help lower-paid workers have children. But then came the caveat: “I want to emphasise that this is aimed at British families. It’s not aimed at those that come into the country and suddenly decide to have a lot of children.” He didn’t stop there. Farage also floated more generous tax breaks for married couples, if elected, and tougher restrictions on abortion. He called the current 24-week limit “ludicrous”. This isn’t a new strategy in Europe. Farage appears to be mirroring Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, a pioneer in blending anti-immigration rhetoric with anti-abortion measures, while promoting nativist policies to boost birthrates. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Sian Norris, author of Bodies Under Siege: How the Far-Right Attack on Reproductive Rights Went Global, about how these tactics are gaining ground in the UK, and what they could mean for the future of reproductive rights. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | Ukraine has launched a “large-scale” drone attack against Russian military bombers in Siberia, striking more than 40 warplanes thousands of miles from its own territory. On the eve of peace talks, the drone attack on four separate airfields was part of a sharp ramping up of the three-year war. Israel-Gaza war | More than 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sunday as they went to an aid distribution point in Gaza, according to witnesses. Israeli forces were said to have opened fire as Palestinians headed for the aid distribution site run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Poland | The populist-right opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki has won the presidential race in an extremely close contest. A pro-Trump nationalist, Nawrocki beat the pro-European Warsaw mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, in a major blow for Donald Tusk’s coalition government. Defence | Britain needs to be ready to fight a war in Europe or the Atlantic, a strategic defence review will conclude. But the plan, to be launched on Monday, it is not expected to contain any additional spending commitments. Health | Exercise can reduce the risk of cancer patients dying by a third, stop tumours coming back and is even more effective than drugs, according to the results of a landmark trial that could transform health guidelines worldwide. In depth: ‘Chipping away at abortion rights makes it easier to chip away at the next one’ When Sian Norris first began investigating the UK’s anti-abortion movement, she came across an organisation called UK Life League. Its founder, Jim Dowson, is perhaps better known for starting the far-right party Britain First. At first glance, the group seemed focused solely on opposing abortion. But once she started digging into their language and literature, it was clear that anti-abortion and anti-immigration rhetoric were being fused together. Alongside the usual scaremongering about migrants “replacing” white Britons ran a parallel narrative: that feminists were suppressing the white birthrate through abortion and contraception. Together, these ideas were feeding the same conspiracy theory – the so-called “great replacement”. The group’s magazine, Rescue, didn’t exactly hide it. “It would say things like: the children in our classrooms are being replaced by aliens, meaning migrant children, and that white babies were being aborted. It was very full of praise for people like Viktor Orbán and his family protection policy and his anti-migrant policies.” The moment it all clicked for Norris was when she saw a cartoon shared by Mark Collette, the founder of far-right group Patriotic Alternative. “It was a picture of hijabi-wearing women in a maternity clinic and white women in an abortion clinic with the caption ‘this is white genocide’. It’s this idea that white women are not doing their ‘duty’ making white babies.” Norris also points to the man who carried out the terrorist attack against Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand. In his manifesto, he fixated on declining birthrates and blamed what he called “selfish individualism” among women for not having enough children. These links between anti-abortion politics and the far right, Norris said, shouldn’t come as a surprise. Often misogyny is the gateway drug to the far right for young men. “If you’ve got male supremacy in your head, then white supremacy is the next obvious step.” *** The Orbán playbook A couple of months ago, Norris went undercover to a Reform rally in Birmingham. In one event, the host was “throwing out Labour policies” to gauge the audience’s reactions, she said. Some topics got big reactions, like winter fuel allowance cuts or the lack of housing for veterans. But when it came to proposed cuts to disability benefits, she told me, “it was crickets.” The silence was revealing. “Benefits themselves aren’t really a motivating issue for Reform voters,” she said. Farage was quite explicit about this when he backed calls to scrap the two-child benefit cap, not because he supports “a benefits culture”. He is first and foremost concerned with demographic concerns. Norris described that as a “classic tactic” from the far right when it comes to natalist policies. “Orbán is the European politician that really normalised great replacement conspiracy theory. He was the one that would go to conferences and talk about replacement, talk about demographics. He would say that if you wanted a Christian Hungary and a Christian Europe, the way to do this was to incentivise ethnic Hungarian married women to have more children,” she said. “And, we know that Farage is really influenced by the kind of Orban, US conservatism movement.” She added that, for Farage, the driving force of this policy is not a concern about child poverty. “He’s talking about it because he wants more British women to have more British babies, and the fact that it would be coupled with this tax break for married couples is again a learned tactic from the far right in terms of what kind of families we value.” *** A new front in the culture war Farage has been active in British politics for more than three decades, but until recently, he had said very little about abortion. That changed last November, when he called for parliament to debate reducing the legal abortion limit from 24 weeks, citing advances in medical technology. The remarks marked a notable shift, which worries Norris. “It feels like this is going to be the new front in the culture war. We know that the far right is very good at working out which issues are going to work in different territories. So in Poland, it’s very much about abortion. In Romania, it’s very much LGBT rights,” she said. Norris described the 24-week abortion limit as “the wedge” when it comes to anti-abortion campaigning. “Abortion has mass popular support in this country. The British Attitudes Survey puts it at about 90% support for abortion in some circumstances,” she said. “But people do get really emotional about the 24-week limit because of foetus viability and the fact that you can technically have a baby below 24 weeks.” It’s a tactic designed to trigger outrage and force a polarising debate, she explained. Supporters of abortion rights are pushed to defend procedures that are already rare and deeply complex. Only about 1% of UK abortions take place after 20 weeks, and these are almost always carried out in exceptional circumstances, such as severe foetal abnormalities or serious risks to the mother’s health. “I think it’s going to be a whipping up of cultural values. It will be framed as: are you the mad, woke, pro-abortion side or the traditional, family-centric, anti-abortion side? That really concerns me,” Norris said. Her reporting has uncovered links between rightwing MPs and US-backed Christian charities funding anti-abortion campaigns in the UK. These groups, she says, are already laying the groundwork ahead of a potential parliamentary debate over legislation that would remove the threat of imprisonment for women who terminate a pregnancy after 24 weeks. They would be using trialled and tested messaging and tactics, Norris explained, most notably in the US. “As soon as you start chipping away at abortion rights, it’s much easier to chip away at the next one,” she warned. “We’ll go from 24 weeks to 22 weeks, and then, ‘well, what about 20 weeks?’ And then, ‘what about if we add in this extra barrier and say you have an ultrasound, or have to have counselling’?” *** The right direction It’s still unclear how successful Farage will be with this new strategy. Over the past decade, the UK has seen a string of major victories for abortion rights: decriminalisation in Northern Ireland, the permanent adoption of telemedicine after the pandemic and the introduction of buffer zones around clinics. Now, the focus is on the upcoming parliamentary vote to decriminalise abortion. The vote, originally scheduled for last year, was expected to pass, even under a Conservative majority. “Now I think with a Labour majority there’s an even bigger chance of that happening. So I do think politically we are moving in the right direction and the momentum is for the pro-abortion movement,” Norris said. While she remains concerned about abortion becoming the next front in the UK’s culture wars, Norris is confident that public support remains strong. “The anti-abortion movement is very noisy, but it is pretty small.” This is true, she added, even on a global scale. Although Roe v Wade was overturned in America, there were also significant global wins. In 2020, Argentina legalised abortion up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. In Mexico, in 2023, the supreme court decriminalised abortion across the country. Norris points to a report by the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which found that over the past 30 years, more than 60 countries and territories have liberalised their abortion laws. Only four have rolled back access. What else we’ve been reading Jacinda Ardern took power in New Zealand in the same year Donald Trump first became president in the United States; to her fans, she is a shining emblem of what politics might have been, or might still be. In Katharine Viner’s fascinating interview for Saturday magazine, she reflects on the politician’s lot: “People only see the decisions you made, not the choices you had.” Archie As Aamna explains above, Reform UK’s promise to remove the two-child benefit limit is an abrupt political pivot – but it is hardly representative of “Farageonomics” as a whole.

"abortion","Beatriz v El Salvador: the abortion case that could set a precedent across Latin America","Earlier this year, Morena Herrera woke up to find that a video about her had been posted on social media. It claimed that the 64-year-old campaigner for abortion rights in El Salvador had “chased down” a young woman in hospital and “terrorised” her into seeking an abortion. The young woman was Beatriz, who had been denied an abortion in 2013, even though she was seriously ill and the foetus would not have survived outside the uterus. Beatriz died after being involved in a traffic accident in 2017, but her case is before judges at the inter-American court of human rights (IACHR), based in Costa Rica, and could open the way for El Salvador to decriminalise abortion. It could also set an important precedent in the region: across the Caribbean, South and Central America, abortion is not permitted for any reason in seven countries. In El Salvador, abortion can be punished by up to eight years in prison, and women can even be charged with aggravated homicide, which carries a sentence of up to 50 years in prison. Women have been jailed for miscarriages. This is not the first time Herrera has been subjected to such an attack. “There have been videos of me on several occasions which tell the government to prosecute me,” she says. “There had already been a campaign saying that I traded in foetal organs – an absurd thing.” In a video posted last year, Herrera was called an “enemy of the state”, a “colleague of terrorists” and a “feminazi”. The videos are part of a slew of attacks that activists say has picked up pace in the lead-up to the judgment in the Beatriz case, which is expected soon. In 2023, IM-Defensoras, an organisation that supports female, transgender and non-binary human rights defender human rights defenders in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, documented 188 attacks on activists in El Salvador, 78% of which were digital. Almost two-thirds (62%) targeted women campaigning for sexual and reproductive rights. The majority occurred around the time Beatriz’s case was being heard at the IACHR. “A lot of the attacks are aimed at stigmatisation,” says Lydia Alpizar, co- director of IM-Defensoras. “[They are] slandering campaigns, fake news, manipulation and question or doubt [activists’] ethical or moral qualities. “It’s very clear that anti-rights and anti-gender groups that have affinity with the government are attacking and questioning the point of view of feminists and defenders, and also trying to put pressure on the inter-American court to avoid any kind of advancement.” On one website set up to discredit the case of Beatriz, there are photos of the judges of the IACHR at the top alongside a heading in white and red capital letters that reads: “They want to legalise abortion with a fake case.” Below is a link to a petition asking the judges not to “sell out”. The website was created by the Global Center for Human Rights, a US-based anti-abortion organisation linked to conservative evangelical groups that opposes what it calls “ideological colonisation [of] countries rooted in Christian values”. According to the organisation’s social media, it hosted an event in July 2023 with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington thinktank, “highlighting the use of US taxpayer funds to finance the undermining of fundamental freedoms in Latin America and the Caribbean”. The Heritage Foundation is the creator of Project 2025, a roadmap for the second Trump presidency that aims to further curb abortion rights, among other things. A video claiming the Beatriz case is “fake”, co-produced by the Global Center for Human Rights, was posted in August on the YouTube channel of Ciudadanos Argentina. This political group is linked to La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances), the far-right coalition led by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who wants to reverse the country’s landmark legalisation of abortion in 2020. “Abortion is about to be legalised across all of the American continent if we don’t act urgently,” it states, and lists various human rights organisations and philanthropic foundations as donors of the IACHR, questioning its independence. There is a clip in the video of the president of the court, Nancy Hernández, rejecting such claims as “absolutely false”. Back in El Salvador, Mariana Moisa, a women’s rights activist and founder of the Citizens’ Coalition for the Decriminalisation of Abortion, which campaigns for women convicted over premature births and obstetric emergencies, says she is subjected to an increasing torrent of abuse every time she posts on X. “I have received a lot of threats and hate speech on social networks, especially on X,” she says. “A post can lead to a wave of comments where I’m called a murderer; people accuse me of promoting a crime and there are requests that the attorney general investigate me.” Anti-abortion groups often gather outside her office to pray, which she sees as an act of intimidation. Her organisation’s website was the target of 13,000 cyber-attacks during the hearing of the landmark case of Manuela v El Salvador at the IACHR in 2021. The court ruled that El Salvador violated the human rights of Manuela, a woman who was accused of having an abortion after suffering a miscarriage and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She died two years later, still in detention. “We can clearly see there is a political interest of the extreme right to oppose women’s rights,” says Moisa. “No politician wants their citizens to be truly free, especially not those of the extreme right, so a way to maintain the social order is by oppressing women and girls.” Both Moisa and Herrera worry about the impact of such attacks in the future. They are taking place against a backdrop in El Salvador where a state of emergency to tackle gangs declared by the authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, in March 2022 has led to the arbitrary detention of more than 80,000 people, ill treatment, torture and deaths in custody. Herrera says: “I am not going to say that [these attacks do] not affect me … I worry that at a given moment [authorities] will translate these invented accusations into legal proceedings.” Moisa is also concerned. “I do not want to be in jail,” she says. “But I know that it is a risk that we run as human rights activists in this context. “We believe this fight is urgent and necessary. If we do not fight, there will be more girls who will continue to be forced to give birth.”","2024-12-02T12:00:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/02/el-salvador-antiabortion-international-campaign-disinformation-hate-activists-laws-ban-human-rights"
"abortion","Supreme court paves way for South Carolina and other states to defund Planned Parenthood","The US supreme court has paved the way for South Carolina to kick Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program over its status as an abortion provider, a decision that could embolden red states across the country to effectively “defund” the reproductive healthcare organization. The case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, centers around a 2018 executive order from South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster, that blocked clinics that provide abortions from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Medicaid is the US government’s main health insurance program for low-income people. About 80 million people rely on it. “Payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life,” McMaster said at the time, even though the reimbursements could not be used for abortions. Abortions are also now banned in South Carolina after six weeks of pregnancy. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, a Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates two clinics in South Carolina, and Julie Edwards, a patient who sought birth control, sued over McMaster’s order, arguing that it flew in the face of a federal provision known as the “free choice of provider” clause. That provision guarantees that people insured by Medicaid can freely choose their own providers as long as they accept the program and are qualified to provide care. Lower courts have repeatedly sided with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and Edwards, keeping McMaster’s order from taking effect. The case in front of the supreme court did not directly deal with the question of whether South Carolina could legally remove Planned Parenthood from Medicaid. Instead, the justices were asked to weigh in on a highly technical question: do Medicaid beneficiaries have the right to sue if they believe their right to a free choice of provider has been violated? In a 6-3 decision joined by every member of the court’s conservative supermajority, the justices ruled that, essentially, individuals do not possess that “enforceable right”. “The decision whether to let private plaintiffs enforce a new statutory right poses delicate questions of public policy,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. “New rights for some mean new duties for others. And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.” He continued: “The job of resolving how best to weigh those competing costs and benefits belongs to the people’s elected representatives, not unelected judges charged with applying the law as they find it.” These technicalities cloaked the potentially sweeping consequences of the case. If people can’t sue when they believe a state is violating Medicaid, it is far harder to stop states from discriminating against controversial care, such as abortion, Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health, told the Guardian ahead of oral arguments. The Thursday ruling marks a major victory for the rightwing legal powerhouse Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented South Carolina in the case, and for its fellow anti-abortion allies. The case is part of a longstanding effort by anti-abortion activists to “defund” Planned Parenthood by cutting it out of Medicaid. Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood each year, almost half use Medicaid. The court’s three liberal justices - Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the majority. In her dissent, Jackson argued that Thursday’s ruling not only undercuts the rights of Medicaid beneficiaries, but also participates in a “project of stymying one of the country’s great civil rights laws” by hollowing out the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which strengthens people’s ability to go to court when a state violates their federal rights. “Today’s decision is likely to result in tangible harm to real people,” Jackson wrote. “At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them. And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians – and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country – of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable’.” Reproductive rights supporters also decried the Thursday ruling. “Today’s decision is a direct attack on reproductive health care, and it is a dangerous green light for politicians to target any providers they don’t like,” said Jennifer Driver, senior director of reproductive rights at State Innovation Exchange, in a statement. “This ruling will deepen health inequities, strip people of their freedom to choose, and put basic services like birth control, cancer screenings, and STI testing further out of reach.”","2025-06-26T15:22:40Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/supreme-court-planned-parenthood-decision"
"abortion","Senior Coalition women and senator Matt Canavan reject Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s abortion comments","Senior Coalition women have rebuked Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s comments about abortion, saying the Liberal party had “no interest in unwinding women’s reproductive rights” and saying it was an issue advanced by “fringe” politicians. Even staunchly “pro-life” colleagues of the senator would not back her comments on Wednesday, with Queensland’s Matt Canavan saying it would not be helpful to discuss abortion in the lead-up to the federal election, and calling to “turn the temperature down” on the debate. Sussan Ley, Jane Hume and Bridget McKenzie – three of the most senior female members of the Liberal and National parties – all flatly rejected putting abortion on the national agenda, saying it was an issue for states and territories. Hume, the shadow finance spokesperson, said: “A Dutton-led Coalition government has no plans, no policy and no interest in unwinding women’s reproductive rights.” Price – the shadow Indigenous Australians spokesperson – told the Nine newspapers she “cannot agree” with later term abortions, which she claimed was “anywhere past the [first] trimester as far as I’m concerned … Full-term becomes infanticide.” Later term abortion is a non-medical term for terminations after 20 weeks’ gestation, according to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and can happen because of foetal abnormalities or if the mother’s life is at risk. The first trimester is 12 weeks. Guardian Australia understands Price’s comments were not authorised by the Coalition leadership and are seen among the opposition’s senior ranks as unhelpful, ranging outside her own portfolio and risking a divisive and potentially damaging debate. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It comes as several states debate abortion issues, sparked by conservative politicians seeking to re-examine the issue: abortion is featuring heavily in the Queensland state election; and South Australia’s parliament narrowly rejected a motion last week which would have wound back abortion care. Ley, the deputy Liberal leader and shadow spokesperson for women, twice said on Wednesday the Liberals were not planning to address abortion laws. “It’s important to remember that access to abortion is a state issue, which is why you often see it debated at state level, and we have no intention to change the settings from a federal health perspective,” she told Sky News. “Obviously, individuals have their own views, and Jacinta is entitled, as a member of the National party, to her own view, but the federal Liberals have no intention of changing the settings when it comes to this issue.” Hume told Sky: “It’s not going to happen. “It’s not an issue for the federal government. In the Liberal party, it’s always been an issue of conscience, too, and rightly so. There are some deeply held views right around the country and that is fine. That’s why they call it choice.” McKenzie told ABC Radio National that she accepted Price had strong views on the issue, but reiterated that it was not a federal issue. Asked for her views on the matter, McKenzie said: “I don’t think it’s helpful.” Canavan, who has described himself as “pro-life”, said “I don’t think this is an issue best prosecuted through the heat of an election campaign.” “I don’t think there’s anything to be gained by playing it out in a tit-for-tat type process,” he told a press conference on Wednesday. “It’s a really sensitive issue for people and I really feel for young mums who have been through this … I’m not ever going to have to experience that, I don’t think that says you can’t have a view on it, but I do try and be sensitive about it, but I’m not the one trying to raise this.” The federal health minister, Mark Butler, also stressed it was a state responsibility, and noted the Labor government had improved access to non-surgical abortions by removing restrictions. “I am committed to ensuring that all Australian women have equitable access to the healthcare they need, particularly women in rural and regional areas and those experiencing disadvantage,” he said in a statement. But Larissa Waters, the Greens spokesperson on women, said she was “appalled” that politicians were debating women’s right to choose. “Abortion is healthcare, and that’s a national issue, so what we should be talking about is how to make abortions affordable and accessible for everyone – not restricting the legal right to choose,” she said. “It’s ludicrous that anyone would propose forcing someone to go through with an unplanned pregnancy against their wishes. “If you don’t want to have an abortion, don’t have one, but you don’t get to tell other women what choices they should have.”","2024-10-23T07:11:57Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/senior-coalition-women-and-pro-life-senator-matt-canavan-reject-jacinta-prices-abortion-comments"
"abortion","New York Planned Parenthood staff decry ‘devastating’ abortion service cuts","In the coming weeks, Planned Parenthood’s Manhattan health center will stop offering core reproductive health services, including abortions after 20 weeks and deep sedation for procedures like abortion or IUD insertion. The Manhattan clinic currently offers abortion through 24 weeks and is the only Planned Parenthood location in the state that does so. The group has been beset by financial challenges, and plans to close a number of New York clinics in the near future. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York (PPGNY), which operates the Manhattan clinic, announced the changes – which the group said were temporary and would take effect on 3 September – earlier this month, blaming them on financial problems. The organization said it would refer patients in need of those services to independent providers. “Any reduction of access is really devastating,” one staff member said. “People who are seeking abortion later in their pregnancy are a really vulnerable and highly stigmatized group of people.” Staffers said that the clinic already quietly stopped providing some services, more than three weeks before the 3 September date. In a release, PPGNY cited budget shortfalls due in part to state lawmakers failing to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for medication abortion. More than half of the organization’s patients have Medicaid, a state-run health insurance program for low-income people. The affiliate says the financial strain makes it unable to afford a third-party anaesthesia provider, and that deep sedation is its standard of care for abortions after 20 weeks. The New York affiliate said it has instituted other cost-cutting measures such as executive pay cuts and consolidated job functions, but PPGNY also plans to close four health centers pending state approval – including its only clinic in Staten Island, which currently only offers medication abortion. More than 115 workers at the Manhattan clinic signed a petition to PPGNY leadership on 2 August urging them to renew the contract with the anaesthesia provider. Deep sedation – one level below general anaesthesia – is an important option for minors, sexual assault survivors and people with PTSD and other mental health diagnoses, the staffers wrote. They added that, of the clinic’s abortion patients who don’t use pills, about 80% opt for deep sedation. The affiliate has quietly cut back on services weeks ahead of the scheduled change, clinic staff say. One employee said deep sedation was now only available for abortion patients over 19 weeks and six days of pregnancy, for people allergic to the drugs used for moderate sedation, and for those with substance use disorder. (The drugs are an opioid and a benzodiazepine.) There are no other exceptions, they said. Some patients who booked abortions with deep sedation for August made the necessary and often expensive preparations, only to learn upon arrival that their only options were moderate sedation and local anaesthesia, a second staffer said. Some chose not to have an abortion as a result, while others felt they had to proceed as they had already taken time off work or arranged childcare. Both staffers asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retribution. The anaesthesia contractors are still working on-site for the permitted cases until 31 August, even though they are not providing services for patients before 20 weeks. “We had a minor flying in from another state devastated and inconsolable because she was now having to be referred out for deep sedation,” an anonymous worker said in a statement issued by 115 anonymous staff members protesting against the change. “We’ve had to tell a patient who tried to go through with the procedure without deep sedation but couldn’t tolerate it, to get dressed and we wouldn’t be able to complete the procedure here, even though our anesthesia provider was sitting 10 feet away,” reads another staff account. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York’s CEO, Wendy Stark, acknowledged in a statement that the clinic had “reserved deep sedation resources in the last month of our contract” for select patients. Stark said the operational changes were “heartbreaking” to make and cited “unprecedented challenges” facing the affiliate, including budget deficits of “well over $10 million”. She urged state officials to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for abortions done with pills. “A lot of people do really well with moderate sedation,” the first worker said. “We just want people to still have this option.” The other added: “We have a lot of patients who prefer to be asleep, for whatever reasons that they choose.” Planned Parenthood leadership said at a June meeting that the new gestational limit would affect a small number of people as “only” 282 patients had abortions after 20 weeks in 2023. The staffers wrote in the petition: “As healthcare workers, we consider this intolerable collateral damage.” The workers call on the PPGNY, New York state and donors to “find a way” to prevent the service cuts.","2024-08-17T11:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/17/planned-parenthood-abortion-new-york"
"abortion","Melania Trump’s abortion views baffle both sides: ‘Hard to follow the logic’","The revelation on Wednesday evening that Melania Trump’s forthcoming memoir includes a full-throated defense of abortion rights, an issue her husband Donald Trump has repeatedly flip-flopped on during his presidential campaign, left people on both sides of the issue less than impressed. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,” Melania Trump wrote in her memoir. “I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Melania Trump also defended the right to abortion later on in pregnancy – a procedure that her husband has repeatedly demonized. Less than 1% of abortions occur at or past 21 weeks of gestation. “Sadly for the women across America, Mrs Trump’s husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump abortion ban that threatens their health, their freedom and their lives,” a Harris campaign spokesperson, Sarafina Chitika, said in an email. “Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women and restrict women’s access to reproductive health care.” Melania Trump’s remarks also took anti-abortion activists by surprise. “It’s hard to follow the logic of putting out the former First Lady’s book right before the election undercutting President Trump’s message to pro-life voters,” Kristan Hawkins, president of the powerful Students for Life of America, posted on Twitter/X on Wednesday night. “What a waste of momentum.” Over the last several weeks, anti-abortion activists have grown increasingly fed up with the former president, who has struggled, alongside the rest of the Republican party, to redefine his messaging on abortion rights amid outrage over the overturning of Roe v Wade. Earlier in his campaign, Trump bragged about appointing three of the US supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe, branded himself the “most pro-life president ever”. After Kamala Harris became the presidential nominee, however, Trump has pledged that his administration “will be great for women and their reproductive rights” and has vowed not to sign a national abortion ban – just weeks after refusing to say that he would veto one. Melania Trump’s comments may feel like a further insult to the anti-abortion voters who feel abandoned by Trump, said the Republican campaign strategist Liz Mair, adding anti-abortion advocates run potent get-out-the-vote operations. Those advocates were key to Trump’s 2016 victory. “This might be just another thing that piles on to make pro-lifers think: ‘I just can’t with this guy.’ A lot of them were single-issue voters anyway,” Mair said. “He’s not really giving them much of an incentive to show up and do anything to his benefit.” When Tresa Undem, a pollster who has surveyed people about abortion for more than two decades, heard the comments, she immediately thought: “Wow”. Then she thought: “It’s a campaign move.” However, Undem is not sure who, exactly, the move is for – especially given the Trumps’ sometimes frosty relationship in public. Melania Trump has rarely aired her political views and has largely vanished from Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. The odds of Melania Trump’s comments comforting moderate or conservative voters who support abortion rights are “fairly slim”, Undem said. “These strong feelings – they did not suddenly appear this year, right? So she clearly has had no influence on him when it comes to policy related to abortion,” Undem said. “I don’t think she’s ever been positioned, or voters ever think of her, as having any kind of policy position or weight or influence on Trump.”","2024-10-03T01:53:33Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/melania-trump-abortion-views-revelation-reaction"
"abortion","Pro-choice Catholics protest at Vatican after abortion left off summit agenda","A vibrantly coloured, 15-metre-long quilt woven with stories of Catholic women who have had abortions has been unrolled outside the Vatican in protest against the topic being left off the agenda of a major summit hosted by Pope Francis. Thursday’s demonstration by Catholics for Choice, a US-based abortion rights group, comes days after the pontiff emphasised his traditional views of women while reiterating that abortion was “murder” and that doctors who terminate pregnancies were “hitmen”. Those words, made during a visit to Belgium, were enough to prompt the prime minister, Alexander De Croo, to summon the Vatican’s ambassador, it emerged on Thursday. Speaking to parliament, De Croo lambasted the remarks as “unacceptable”, adding he had invited the Holy See’s top diplomat in the country, the apostolic nuncio, “for discussions.” “My message to the apostolic nuncio will be very clear: what happened there is unacceptable,” he said. “We do not need lessons on how our lawmakers democratically approve laws. The time when the church dictated the law in our country is fortunately long behind us,” he said. The month-long, closed-door summit in the Vatican, known as a synod, is the final session of a debate on the future of the church and how to adapt it to the needs of Catholics today. But decisions on some of the most divisive topics, including women’s ordination and blessings for same-sex couples, have been postponed until next year, while abortion was never on the agenda. Official Catholic church teaching condemns abortion in all circumstances, even if there is a risk to the mother’s life. But data from the Pew Research Centre earlier this year showed that the majority of Catholics in the United States, which has the fourth-largest Catholic population in the world, believed it should be legal in all or most cases. “One of the reasons we’re so focused on it in the US is because 98% of Catholic women have used birth control other than natural family planning and one in four abortion patients is Catholic,” said Ashley Wilson, a senior adviser for Catholics for Choice. “But the issue of abortion, and contraception, does not get the same amount of attention as other church justice issues, even though it affects possibly far more people. For [the Church hierarchy] to say that ‘we need to be tough on abortion’ feels really out of touch. We cannot pass up this opportunity to have our voices heard.” Catholics for Choice gathered 180 testimonies from Catholic women who had terminated a pregnancy, of which 51 were published in a book presented to the synod’s office on Thursday but which was ultimately rejected. Many of the women came forward with their abortion stories after the US supreme court overturned its landmark Roe v Wade decision in 2022, ending a constitutional right to abortion that had been in place for 50 years. The reasons behind their decisions were varied. Some chose to end their pregnancies due to health concerns or foetal abnormalities, while others were unplanned or the women did not feel ready to start a family. One woman told how, in her 20s, she fell pregnant while in an abusive relationship and didn’t want to be forced to marry the man. “The stories are heartbreaking, inspiring, empowering and everything in between,” said Wilson. “Catholics for Choice was actually founded when Roe v Wade became law, and when it was overturned many people realised that they needed to come forward.” Pope Francis sparked criticism in September after urging US Catholics to choose the “lesser evil” in the upcoming presidential election. Without mentioning the names of the two candidates, he said both were “against life”, seemingly referring to Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and Kamala Harris’s stance on abortion. “A lot of people forget that Pope Francis is a head of state too and shouldn’t be commenting on elections,” added Wilson. “If Emmanuel Macron had made those comments people would have freaked out.” While in Belgium, Francis was also widely criticised for his views on the role of women in society. “It is a huge thing, but he doesn’t seem to fully realise the ripple effects of his words and the violence they can cause to people,” said Wilson. “There are women in the US who are dying of sepsis because they can’t get the abortion care they need. And the most powerful lobby behind abortion bans in any country is the Catholic church. It’s both shocking and outrageous.”","2024-10-03T16:06:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/pro-choice-catholics-stage-protest-after-abortion-left-off-summit-agenda"
"abortion","Beyoncé to appear with Kamala Harris in Houston to highlight abortion rights – reports","Beyoncé will appear with Kamala Harris in Houston on Friday, according to media reports. The star turn will confirm that, following Harris’s endorsement by Taylor Swift last month, the Democratic vice-president and US presidential candidate has the support of the two most popular musicians in the world – a potentially invaluable asset for galvanising young voters. Harris is rallying in Texas, a Republican stronghold, to highlight abortion rights and support Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who trails Republican Ted Cruz in opinion polls. Beyoncé, 43, will appear in her home city along with her mother, Tina Knowles, and 91-year-old country music giant Willie Nelson, according to sources cited by the Washington Post newspaper. The event presents an opportunity for Beyoncé to give a live performance of Freedom, a song from her 2016 album Lemonade, which the vice-president has been using as walk-on music at rallies while making freedom a central theme of her campaign. Beyoncé, who has hundreds of millions of followers on social media, sang a cover of Etta James’s At Last at one of President Barack Obama’s inaugural balls in 2009, before singing the national anthem at Obama’s second inauguration ceremony in 2013. She performed Formation at a rally for Democrat Hillary Clinton three days before the presidential election in 2016 and told the crowd: “I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman leading the country. That’s why I’m with her.” Her backing of Harris is therefore no surprise and fed fevered speculation – and inaccurate reporting – that she would make a dramatic entrance at this summer’s Democratic national convention in Philadelphia. Beyoncé becomes the latest celebrity to bring star power to the Harris campaign. On Thursday, the Democrat is holding a rally in Atlanta, Georgia, with musician Bruce Springsteen, film director Spike Lee, actor Samuel L Jackson and actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry as well as Obama. Other musicians supporting the Democrat include Eminem, Cher, Billie Eilish, Barbra Streisand, Carole King, John Legend and Stevie Wonder. Trump has the backing of Jason Aldean, Lee Greenwood, Kanye West and Kid Rock, while the Republican national convention was shown a video featuring rapper Forgiato Blow and reality TV star Amber Rose.","2024-10-24T16:55:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/24/kamala-harris-beyonce-houston-rally-abortion-rights"
"abortion","Fact-checking the US vice-presidential debate: abortion, immigration, climate and more","Tim Walz and JD Vance faced each other for the first and only vice-presidential debate of this election cycle – and clashed on issues including abortion, childcare, the cost of living and Trump’s 2020 election claims. Here are the facts on some of the false or misleading claims offered during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. Vance on Harris’s record as ‘border tsar’ Vance attacked Harris’s record on the border. “The only thing that she did when she became the vice-president, when she became the appointed border tsar, was to undo Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border,” he said. This contains inaccuracies. First, Harris was never a “border tsar” – that’s a term invented by her critics. She had a role in the Biden administration to look into addressing the root causes of migration to the US, including safety and economic turmoil in Central American countries. Second, she did not “undo Donald Trump executive actions”. Presidents sign executive orders, and she was not president. Joe Biden did reverse some Trump executive orders on the border. He initially kept in place Trump-era restrictions known as Title 42, which allowed the US to turn away immigrants at the border on the grounds of preventing the spread of Covid-19, before eventually lifting them. Vance on Trump’s role on January 6 Vance defended Trump’s role on the day of the insurrection at the US Capitol. The Ohio senator picked out one line of his running mate’s speech on 6 January 2021 – prior to the insurrection. According to Vance, Trump “said on January 6 the protesters ought to protest peacefully”. But Trump also repeatedly encouraged supporters to “fight”. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said in 2021. Vance on Trump and the Affordable Care Act Vance claimed that Donald Trump bolstered or salvaged the Affordable Care Act. That’s not true. The former president cut millions in funding for helping people enroll in healthcare, repeatedly supported efforts in Congress to repeal the law and asked the supreme court to overturn the law. Vance on immigrants and housing prices Vance twice implicated immigrants in driving up housing prices, though when pressed, agreed that immigration was not the “only” contributor. A nonpartisan analysis found that Trump’s vow of mass deportation would drive up prices in several sectors and affect the availability of labor. The Peterson Institute for International Economics projects that the policy would be “a major shock to the US economy, with substantial disruption across all sectors, especially agriculture, mining, and manufacturing”. Vance on Trump’s position on abortion Vance said that Donald Trump has supported states making their own abortion laws. Vance claimed that Trump has said that “the proper way to handle this … is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy”. That’s not quite right. Donald Trump declined to say whether he would sign a national abortion ban during the last debate. Walz on Project 2025’s ambitions The Minnesota governor claimed that Project 2025, the ambitious blueprint from the Heritage Foundation to remake the federal government under a second Trump term, would require people to register their pregnancies. “Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,” Walz said. That claim is false. Project 2025 calls for a number of restrictive policies on abortion, including reversing FDA approval of abortion pills, rolling back privacy protections for abortion patients and increasing surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over abortion, but it does not call for all pregnant people to register. The CDC already collects information about abortion from most of the country, but its reports are incomplete, as some states do not supply the data. Project 2025 suggests that the CDC should go so far as to cut funds from a state if it does not tell the CDC “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”. Vance on immigrants in Springfield, Ohio Referring to Springfield, Ohio – where a number of Haitian immigrants have recently settled – Vance referred to immigrants with legal status as “illegal”. “You’ve got schools that are overwhelmed, you’ve got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you’ve got housing that’s totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,” he said. The Haitian immigrants in Springfield, as CBS moderator Margaret Brennan noted, have legal status. Their arrival, local residents and leaders have said, has helped revive the town, which has lost a quarter of its population since the 1960s. Vance on the climate crisis and manufacturing The Ohio senator has repeatedly expressed skepticism about the reality that carbon emissions have caused global heating. Tonight, he was a bit subtle: “One of the things that I’ve noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions, this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change … let’s just say that’s true, just for the sake of argument.” Despite Vance’s skepticism, it is indeed true. One hundred percent of global heating since 1950 is due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Vance also took viewers on a circuitous journey to suggest that if Harris really cared about the climate crisis, she would bring back manufacturing jobs to the US. Carbon emissions, whether they are manufactured in the US or overseas, contribute to global heating. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 – the Biden administration’s landmark climate legislation – is greatly aimed at incentivizing domestic manufacturing.

"abortion","The Christian right has set the US on the road to Gilead. Without a fight, other nations may follow","With Donald Trump as president, there is now a heavy strain of Christian nationalism driving the US political agenda. From draconian abortion policies to ending birthright citizenship, some of Trump’s first executive orders sound startlingly like something out of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, the dystopian novel turned TV show set in Gilead, a fundamentalist, fascist version of the US where women have no rights. But it is urgent we understand that what is happening in the US could happen here. This road to Atwood’s Gilead is charting a course straight through the UK and Europe, and we may well be sleepwalking on to it. In November 2024 I debated with the American conservative lawyer Erin Hawley at the Oxford Union. The motion was “This house regrets the overturning of Roe v Wade”, the US supreme court’s landmark decision that once protected the right to have an abortion at the federal level. Hawley is vice-president of the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), an “anti-LGBTQ+ hate group”, according to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, founded by the US Christian right. She is also a high profile lawyer and supported the state of Mississippi on the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case that overturned Roe. During the debate, Hawley argued that Roe was a “usurpation of democratic process” made by an all-male supreme court. She mentioned the constitution a lot but, curiously, I didn’t hear her mention God. I was surprised because I had just spent the afternoon listening to the podcast This is Living, which she hosts with her husband, the senator Josh Hawley, and on which she describes her decision to fight Roe as “a calling from God”, putting her success down to “the prayers of believers”. On one episode, the Hawleys suggest that where abortion is now illegal their listeners “adopt a mom who is unexpectedly expecting” to help her – and “most importantly, introduce her to Jesus”. The overt religious agenda of Hawley’s podcast is completely at odds with the legalese she used in court and in the debating chamber. But the ADF itself is more explicit. The CEO’s statement on its website reads: “We will do – as we have done – the hard things to which God has called us with the expectation that He will accomplish His purposes.” This kind of language is no longer solely the preserve of organisations of the Christian right – it has infiltrated the highest offices. The White House’s new “faith office” webpage proudly declares: “In his first week, President Trump pardoned Christians and pro-life activists who were persecuted by the weaponized Biden Administration for praying and peacefully living out their faith.” The tragic reality is that the “pro-life” Dobbs ruling is killing people. In states where abortion is illegal unless the life of the woman or other pregnant person is at stake, patients are suffering and even dying. Doctors are frightened to give them care for fear of being struck off and even sent to jail. In South Carolina, legislators are trying to pass a bill that would classify abortion as homicide, punishable by the death penalty. Elsewhere, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has reportedly issued a list of keywords that trigger staff to review science research projects to determine if they violate Trump-issued executive orders. The words “female” and “woman” are on that list, but “male” and “man” are not. But this isn’t exclusively a US problem – women’s rights are increasingly at risk in the UK and Europe, too. Last year, while doing research for my book Six Conversations We’re Scared to Have, I discovered that from 1861 to November 2022 only three women had ever been prosecuted for terminating a pregnancy in the UK. But in the past two years alone, at least six women have appeared in court and dozens more have been investigated. It is a criminal offence to have an abortion after 24 weeks in the UK or without approval from two doctors, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. While it is true that the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol became available to use at home for women before 10 weeks of pregnancy during the pandemic, this change in procedure does not sufficiently explain such a radical increase in prosecutions. Dr Jonathan Lord, a co-chair of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) abortion taskforce, has warned that when an unexplained pregnancy loss is suspected of being an illegal abortion, police in some areas are seizing women’s phones to search for period tracking apps and their internet history. There have also been reports that police are drug-testing distressed women who have suffered late-stage pregnancy loss and subjecting them to lengthy and distressing investigations. Between 2008 and 2017, about $50m of funding flowed into Europe from 12 of the most influential Christian rightwing foundations in the US, according to research by OpenDemocracy in 2019. Neil Datta, the executive director of the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, told me there has been a creeping expansion of anti-abortion Christian nationalist groups in the UK since 2013. When same-sex marriage was legalised in the UK and France, these groups went into overdrive and were triggered to hire lawyers and political scientists to learn how to draft laws and bills to fight progressive movements. “They style themselves as NGOs, thinktanks and, in some cases, political parties,” Datta told me. “But when you scratch the surface, you see religious connections in almost all of them.” Many of these groups originated in the US Christian right, but have now opened offices in Europe, including the ADF’s international subsidiary, operating since 2010, which now has five – including in Brussels, Strasbourg and London. Just this week, an activist in the UK was convicted of breaching a buffer zone outside an abortion clinic. Her case was funded by the UK branch of the ADF. It doesn’t feel like much of a stretch to suggest that their dream seems to be reflected in the growing popularity of the tradwives of TikTok: white women in gingham baking pies for their six children, bragging about financial dependence and recommending raw milk for fertility. Coincidentally, if you watch enough tradwife content, as I did while researching my book, you start to see advertisements for the ADF. The road to Gilead is circular – once you’re on it, it’s hard to get off. In late 2024, Nigel Farage was reported to be linking up with the ADF, calling for a parliamentary debate to cut the time limit for abortion in the UK. Elon Musk recently responded to a suggestion from Andrew Tate that he would run to be British prime minister by saying, “He’s not wrong.” Last year I would have laughed at the very idea that we could be under his eye. This year, I’m not so sure. It is time to fight for what we have. France made abortion a constitutional right in 2024. In January, more than 30 groups in the UK, including the British Medical Association and the Faculty of Public Health, representing 800,000 health care professionals, demanded “urgent action” to safeguard reproductive rights. If we don’t take action now, we could be sleepwalking into a future where neither Erin Hawley nor I may have the luxury of debating in public again.

"abortion","Walz and Vance clash over abortion and immigration in vice-presidential debate","Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September’s presidential debate, but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration. Three weeks ago Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had endured a contentious hour and a half, with an emotional Trump being goaded into ranting about the number of people who attend his rallies and declaring the vice-president to be a “Marxist”, before reportedly threatening to sue one of the debate moderators. Harris enjoyed a brief polling uptick from that performance. But on Tuesday, Walz and Vance largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other’s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates’, but one with a few gaffes that might overshadow some of the substance in coming days. In a key exchange over abortion, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, followed Harris’s lead in using personal stories. Trump “brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe v Wade”, Walz said. He noted the case of Amanda Zurawski, who was denied an abortion in Texas despite serious health complications during pregnancy – Zurawski is now part of a group of women suing the state of Texas – and a girl in Kentucky who as a child was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant. “If you don’t know [women like this], you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,” Walz said, which Vance contested. Walz also criticized the Trump-Vance position that states should decide whether women have access to abortion. “That’s not how this works. This is basic human rights. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world,” he said. When Harris was considering Walz as her vice-presidential candidate, he reportedly told her that he was a bad debater, and at the outset Vance, wearing a sharp blue suit, a pink tie, plenty of make-up and hair gel, looked the more polished performer. Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, cut a more bustling figure in a loose black suit. Vance, the Ohio senator who has been a regular on rightwing news channels for years, was polished from the off, comfortably dodging a question about whether he believes the climate crisis is a “hoax” to lament how much money has been spent on solar panels. Walz rose to the vice-presidential nomination, in part, through his confident appearances on cable news – it was from there that his famous “weird” characterization of Vance and Trump was born – but appeared initially nervous, and did not reprise his searing critique of his opponents. Both men also frequently referenced their upbringing in the midwest. “I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, trying to do the best I can, but I’ve not been perfect and I’m a knucklehead at times,” Walz said, while attempting to navigate a question about his time in China. “But [Minnesotans] elected me to Congress for 12 years.” Walz also criticized Trump and Vance for demonizing immigrants in Springfield, Ohio; the two have falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants are eating people’s pets, which has led to bomb threats and children in the city having to be escorted to school by police. Asked about immigration, one of the key issues in November, Walz discussed Harris’s history in California, demonstrating that the real goal here was for both him and Vance to talk up their bosses’ records rather than sell their own. “Kamala Harris was the attorney general of the largest border state in California. She’s the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions,” Walz said. Vance blamed Harris for the number of people who have crossed the border under the Biden administration, which prompted Walz to raise the issue of a bipartisan border bill, endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, which was torpedoed by Trump earlier this year. “As soon as that was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Trump said ‘no’, told them to vote against it, because it gives them a campaign issue,” Walz said. The immigration conversation led to an uncomfortable moment for Vance. Trump has said that if he is elected he will carry out “the largest deportation in the history of our country”, but in a country where some families’ children may be US citizens born to non-citizen parents, he has failed to explain how that would work. Asked whether a Trump administration would separate immigrant parents from their US-citizen children, Vance twice refused to answer. Walz’s missteps, meanwhile, were largely style not substance but could prove fodder for the right in coming days. He was asked about his false claim that he was in Hong Kong “when Tiananmen happened”, referring to the anti-government protests that culminated in the massacre of hundreds of people in June 1989. It emerged this week that Walz had traveled to China in August, two months later. “Look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, a town of 400, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies until the street lights come on, and I’m proud of that service,” Walz’s answer began, as he attempted to avoid the question entirely. Pressed further, Walz said: “I got there that summer and misspoke on this. So I will just … that’s what I’ve said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests. And from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.” As the debate drew towards a close, both men were asked about the issue of school shootings, and whether AR-15 style guns, which have been used in several mass shootings, should be banned. Vance called school shootings “terrible stuff” before he sought to blame Harris for gun violence. He claimed there has been a “a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartels” – although in the majority of school shootings the weapons used have been legally purchased. Democrats have pushed for stricter gun controls to curb mass shootings, but Vance took a different approach. “What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer, because I don’t want my kids to go to school in a school that feels unsafe or there are visible signs of security, but I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the door stronger. We’ve got to make the windows stronger,” Vance said. Walz was more forthright. He said he had met with the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting, and said “our first responsibility is to our kids,” detailing his red flag policies in Minnesota. “I ask all of you out there: your schools hardened to look like a fort – is that, is that what we have to go through?” he said. “I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it’s just the guns.” But his strong answer on gun reform was eclipsed on social media when he accidentally said he “befriended school shooters” rather than victims. Vice-presidents, and their debates, have typically been viewed as unimportant, and it remains to be seen how much impact this debate will have. But with the election expected to be extremely close, if either Vance or Walz managed to convince a few voters, then the hour and a half of scrutiny, and even the gaffes, will have been worth it.","2024-10-02T04:33:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/vice-presidential-debate-walz-vance"
"abortion","Where do babies come from? Robert F Kennedy Jr doesn’t seem to know","Robert F Kennedy Jr is the father of six children. He’s also the US health secretary. Two facts that might lead a reasonable person to assume he possesses a basic understanding of how foetuses develop. In a shocking development, however, it seems that Kennedy – an anti-vaxxer who says his brain was partly eaten by a parasitic worm – may not know what he’s talking about. During a cabinet meeting last Thursday, Kennedy reasserted unproven claims that taking the common painkiller acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol or paracetamol, while pregnant causes autism. Doubters of this theory, he said, were motivated by Trump derangement syndrome. To underscore his point, he referenced a TikTok video he’d seen of a pregnant woman “gobbling Tylenol with her baby in her placenta”. Foetuses, of course, develop in the uterus, not the placenta. It’s possible, if we are being generous, that Kennedy misspoke. Then again, he would hardly be the first US politician to make it clear he knows nothing about the female bodies he is so keen to legislate, would he? In 2019, for example, 25 Republicans – all white men – voted for a near-total ban on abortion in Alabama. During the debate, Clyde Chambliss, one of the bill’s sponsors in the Senate, noted that while he didn’t have medical training, “from what I’ve read, what I’ve been told, there’s some period of time before you can know that a woman is pregnant … It takes some time for all those chromosomes and all that.” Chambliss went on to say the generous bill allowed a woman to end her pregnancy “up until the point she is known to be pregnant”. Yeah, I don’t know what he means either. Then there’s the Ohio Republican John Becker, who once co-sponsored a bill prohibiting insurers from covering abortion services, except for a procedure “intended to reimplant” an ectopic pregnancy in a woman’s uterus. This is medically impossible. After this was pointed out, Becker said he’d never actually researched the issue. And there’s the Idaho lawmaker who once asked if a woman could swallow a small camera so doctors could conduct a remote gynaecological exam. No, he was told by a doctor, because swallowed pills don’t end up in your vagina. “Fascinating,” he replied. I could go on; I’m afraid there are endless examples. But I’ll end with the late Todd Akin, a conservative Missouri Republican, who said in 2012 that “legitimate rape” rarely results in pregnancy because “the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down”. Yep, that same crafty female body that grows babies in its placenta. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"abortion","Democrats unite to center reproductive rights as Republicans flail on abortion","As Kamala Harris and Donald Trump prepare to meet on the debate stage in Philadelphia, the battle over abortion rights has vaulted to the center of the 2024 presidential election campaign, the first since the supreme court’s decision overturning Roe v Wade. At the party’s convention last month, Democrats spotlighted the harrowing stories of women placed in medical peril as a result of post-Roe abortion bans in their states. Last week, the Harris campaign launched a 50-stop “reproductive freedom” bus tour across several battleground states, kicking off in Trump’s “back yard”, miles from the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence in south Florida. And this weekend, days before the first – and perhaps only – primetime presidential debate, where the issue is likely to be raised, the Harris campaign debuted three new TV ads reminding voters that Trump has repeatedly taking credit for his role in ending the 50-year-old constitutional right to an abortion. The message is blunt: because of Trump, one in three women of reproductive age now live in states where abortion is banned or significantly restricted. And it could get worse, they warn, if Trump is given a second term. “Donald Trump is a fundamental threat to reproductive freedom – and you don’t have to take our word for it – Trump said it himself,” Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said in a statement. “Vice-President Harris and Governor Walz are fighting to restore reproductive freedom in all 50 states because they trust women to make the right decisions for their families.” In the bitterly contested race for the White House, abortion remains a glaring vulnerability for the Republican nominee. “You know it’s an important issue because Trump is trying to change his position,” said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster. As a candidate, Trump has held conflicting positions on abortion, alternately boasting that he appointed three of the nine supreme court justices whose votes were decisive in overturning Roe, while complaining that Republican extremism on the issue has cost his party at the ballot box. He recently appeared to endorse a ballot measure to expand abortion rights in his adopted home state of Florida, only to announce one day later – after sparking backlash among prominent conservative groups – that he would vote against it. He has also previously hinted at support for a 15-week federal ban only to insist that the issue should be left to the states. His campaign has said Trump would not sign a national abortion ban as president. While the economy remains the top election issue for voters this November, a New York Times/Siena College poll released in August showed that a growing share of battleground state voters, particularly women, say abortion will be central to their decision. Among women younger than 45, abortion has eclipsed the economy as their single most important issue. In the final months of the campaign, Democrats are aiming to harness the unabated anger over the loss of federal abortion protections, especially among women and young people, and unifying around a platform that seeks to protect what remains of abortion access and the availability of reproductive healthcare, including contraception and fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). In polling and focus groups, Lake said abortion rights remains an especially salient issue for women and the issue was helping to fuel a widening gender gap between Harris and Trump. Harris’s vocal support for abortion rights has not only energized young voters, a core Democratic constituency, but is also helping to persuade independent women and, as Lake put it, “older women who remember when abortion was illegal, and don’t think the idea of jailing doctors, investigating miscarriages, [and] eliminating birth control and IVF is a good idea”. In recent weeks, Trump, who has long worried that Republican-led efforts to outlaw abortion and restrict access to reproductive care could imperil his White House bid, has sought recast his approach to the issue. During a town hall even in battleground Wisconsin, he endorsed a plan to make the government or insurance companies cover the cost of IVF – a type of fertility assistance that can cost tens of thousands of dollars and that some in the anti-abortion movement want to see limited. “We wanna produce babies in this country, right?” Trump said. Democrats assailed the proposal as insincere, pointing to the Republican’s record and the positions of his running mate, JD Vance. Trump has had “more positions on reproductive rights than he has had wives”, Ana Navarro, a TV personality and anti-Trump Republican, said last week, at the Florida launch of the Harris campaign’s bus tour. Democrats have leveraged the abortion issue to secure key victories in the 2022 midterms, when mobilization efforts around abortion rights drove strong turnout and enthusiasm, helping the party keep control of the Senate and limiting Republican gains in the House. In Michigan, Democrats secured a governing trifecta as voters in the state overwhelmingly turned out to back a ballot initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state’s constitution. “Bringing the message to the people, talking with women and healthcare providers and our families, that’s how we had such a historic outcome in our ’22 election here in Michigan,” the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a co-chair of Harris’s campaign, said in an MSNBC interview this week. “But it’s important, even for Michiganders and New Yorkers and Floridians, to know what’s at stake if we have a second Trump presidency.” Some Republicans have argued that the potency of abortion rights would wane in a noisy presidential election. But Lake believes the opposite could be true. Abortion rights are a priority for young voters who are more likely to turn out in a presidential election year. Constitutional amendments seeking to guarantee abortion rights are on the ballot in 10 states this fall, including battleground states like Arizona and Nevada as well as Florida, once a presidential bellwether that has trended Republican in recent cycles. “We are the belly of the beast here in the state of Florida,” said Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic party. “We are the state that has drastically moved on abortion from two years ago having full access to now being one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country.” Florida Democrats are hopeful the ballot initiative will help boost the former representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell’s underdog campaign against the Republican incumbent senator Rick Scott. Elsewhere in the battle for control of the Senate, vulnerable Democratic incumbents Jon Tester of Montana and Jacky Rosen of Nevada will appear on the ballot alongside measures to protect abortion rights. Fried, who joined the Harris campaign kick-off in Palm Beach county last week, said the referendum had helped draw attention to the state – and was mobilizing voters of all political stripes. “If they can take away access to reproductive healthcare, what else is next?” she said. “What other types of rights have we moved the needle on that would be going backwards if Trump is re-elected?” The state’s referendum would overturn the state’s unpopular six-week ban, guaranteeing the right to abortion “before viability”, usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. A poll released in mid-August found that 56% of Sunshine state voters support the proposed amendment, just shy of the 60% threshold needed to become law. Yet it drew more support than Trump, who led Harris 51% to 47% in the state, according to the survey. Abortion remains Harris’s strongest issue. She holds a 15-percentage-point advantage over Trump in a national poll of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College. Yet there were also signs that Trump’s mixed signals have muddied the waters on the issue. According to the survey, released Sunday, nearly half of independent voters say they did not think the former president would sign into law a national abortion ban. Still, the Republican nominee must contend with his base, particularly evangelicals and other conservative Christians, who expect Trump to further restrict access to abortion as president. Kristan Hawkins, president of the prominent anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, recently told the Guardian that young conservatives were “shocked and saddened to see someone who they thought was pro-life, or who had always reaffirmed pro-life values, walking back on that”. Tuesday’s presidential debate in Philadelphia offers one of the highest-profile opportunities for Harris to draw a sharp contrast with Trump on abortion. Reproductive rights supporters anticipate Harris will challenge the former president over his attempts to shift positions on the issue. “I hope that Vice-President Harris makes it crystal clear for the tens of millions of people who are watching that leaving it to the states is not a moderate position – that it is extreme,” said Rob Davidson, a Michigan-based emergency physician and executive director of the Committee to Protect Health Care, a left-leaning coalition of physicians and medical professionals that recently endorsed Harris. Davidson said voters will also want to hear Harris articulate her vision for expanding access to reproductive healthcare. “We know what Trump did,” he said. “What are we going to do going forward?”","2024-09-08T16:00:50Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/08/democrats-republicans-abortion-rights-election"
"abortion","Judge rules Missouri ballot measure to protect abortion rights is invalid","A Missouri judge has ruled that a ballot measure asking voters whether abortion rights should be enshrined in the state constitution is invalid, potentially jeopardizing an election scheduled for November. In a ruling issued on Friday, Cole county circuit judge Christopher Limbaugh said that the reproductive rights petition – also known as amendment 3 – led by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom did not comply with state law. Abortion rights activists are hopeful an appellate court could reverse Limbaugh’s decision, but for now it remains unclear whether voters will be able to decide the issue as scheduled on 5 November, the same day as the presidential election. According to Limbaugh, his decision came as a result of the campaign’s “failure to include any statute or provision that will be repealed, especially when many of these statues are apparent”. He went on to add: “The court must conclude that the defendant-intervenors’ initiative petition was insufficient.” Limbaugh, however, also said he “recognizes the gravity of the unique issues involved in this case and the lack of direct precedent on point”. He ruled that he would wait until Tuesday for the amendment to be removed from the ballot, giving an appellate court time to decide whether or not to uphold his ruling. Under amendment 3, Missourians would be granted the constitutional right to an abortion up until fetal viability, in addition to protections surrounding other reproductive healthcare needs such as birth control and in vitro fertilization. The amendment would also provide protections against criminal prosecution for individuals who assist with abortions. Missouri was the first state to officially outlaw abortion after the US supreme court eliminated the federal abortion rights that had previously been established by the Roe v Wade decision. A total of 14 states have now enacted near-total bans on the procedure, though a clear majority of Americans generally favor legalizing access to abortion. But with abortion almost completely banned in the state with very limited exceptions, Missouri is among the most restrictive when it comes to reproductive freedoms. In response to Limbaugh’s ruling, Rachel Sweet, the campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said that the group’s effort “remains unwavering in our mission to ensure Missourians have the right to vote on reproductive freedom”, the Kansas City Star reported. “The court’s decision to block Amendment 3 from appearing on the ballot is a profound injustice to the initiative petition process and undermines the rights of the 380,000 Missourians who signed our petition demanding a voice on this critical issue,” Sweet added. Sweet also vowed to appeal the decision, saying that she hopes for a “swift resolution so that Missourians can vote on November 5 to protect reproductive freedom, including access to abortion, birth control and miscarriage care”.","2024-09-07T16:40:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/07/missouri-abortion-rights-ballot-measure-ruled-invalid"
"abortion","Planned Parenthood sues Trump administration over funding cuts in big bill","Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration on Monday over a provision in Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill that would strip funding from health centers operated by the reproductive healthcare and abortion provider. In a complaint filed in Boston federal court, Planned Parenthood said the provision was unconstitutional, and its clear purpose is to prevent its nearly 600 health centers from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Planned Parenthood said that would have “catastrophic consequences”, given that the health centers serve more than 1 million patients annually through Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. More than 80 million people use Medicaid. “The true design of the Defund Provision is simply to express disapproval of, attack, and punish Planned Parenthood, which plays a particularly prominent role in the public debate over abortion,” Planned Parenthood said in its lawsuit. The lawsuit continued: “Stripping away this patient volume and reimbursements for care provided will result in the elimination of services, laying off staff and health center closures. The public health consequences for Medicaid patients and non-Medicaid patients alike will be dire and compounding.” The organization has estimated that the defunding could force roughly 200 Planned Parenthood clinics to shutter. Blue states, which are home to more people on Medicaid, would probably see a disproportionate number of closures. Since it is illegal to use Medicaid to pay for most abortions, Planned Parenthood clinics rely on the insurance program to reimburse them for providing services like birth control, STI tests and cancer screenings. But if blue-state clinics are forced to close, people will no longer be able to seek abortions at those clinics – a possibility that has led some abortion rights supporters, including Planned Parenthood, to call the Trump bill’s provision a “backdoor abortion ban”. Planned Parenthood provides an estimated 38% of US abortions. “We’re facing a reality of the impact on shutting down almost half of abortion-providing health centers,” Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood Federation of Americas’s CEO, told the Guardian last week. “It does feel existential. Not just for Planned Parenthood, but for communities that are relying on access to this care.” Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit asks the courts to declare the Trump bill’s provision unconstitutional on numerous grounds, or to at least preserve Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics that do not provide abortions. The reproductive health giant suggests in the lawsuit that Congress did not understand its structure when it passed the provision. The Planned Parenthood technically consists of a mothership group, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and nearly 50 regional affiliate groups that operate as independent entities. Medicaid is overseen by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services. That agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Planned Parenthood is being buffeted by intense financial headwinds. This spring, the Trump administration froze tens of millions of dollars earmarked for family planning providers who participate in Title X, the nation’s largest family planning program. Although several of those providers have since had their funding restored, a Planned Parenthood spokesperson said last week their affiliates had not received funding. The US supreme court also ruled in late June in favor of South Carolina in a case involving the state’s attempt to kick Planned Parenthood out of its state Medicaid reimbursement program. Red states may see that ruling as a blessing to their own efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. Even if Planned Parenthood’s Monday lawsuit succeeds, the organization will probably have to grapple with the consequences of that supreme court ruling for years to come.","2025-07-07T16:47:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/planned-parenthood-trump-lawsuit"
"abortion","Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?","This November, abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the states that could determine the next president. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion has become the kind of issue that decides elections. Outrage over Roe’s demise led Republicans to flounder in the 2022 midterms, and abortion rights supporters have won every post-Roe abortion-related ballot measure, including in red states such as Ohio, Kentucky and Kansas. This year, most of the ballot measures are seeking to amend states’ constitutions to protect abortion rights up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Because a number of the measures are in states that have outlawed abortion, they could become the first to overturn the post-Roe ban. Others are in states where abortion is legal, but activists say the measures are necessary to cement protections so they can’t be easily overturned if Republicans control the government. These are the states slated to vote on abortion this election day. Arizona Abortion rights supporters in Arizona, a key battleground state in the presidential election, are vying to pass a measure that would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability in the state constitution. A provider could perform an abortion after viability if the procedure is necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of a patient. Arizona currently bans abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier this year, the state supreme court reinstated a 19th-century near-total abortion ban, generating nationwide outrage that prompted the state legislature to quickly repeal it in favor of letting the 15-week ban stand. Colorado Colorado’s measure would amend the state constitution to block the state government from denying, impeding or discriminating against individuals’ “right to abortion”. This measure also includes a one-of-a-kind provision to bar Colorado from prohibiting healthcare coverage for abortion – which could very well pass in the deep-blue state. Because Colorado permits abortion throughout pregnancy and neighbors five states with bans – Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Nebraska – the state has become a haven for people fleeing abortion bans, especially those seeking abortions later in pregnancy. Florida Once the last stronghold of southern abortion access, Florida in May banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women know they’re pregnant. Its measure, which needs 60% of the vote to pass, would roll back that ban by adding the right to an abortion up until viability to the state’s constitution. Providers could perform an abortion after viability if one is needed to protect a patient’s health. Florida Republicans’ tactics in the fight against the measure has alarmed voting rights and civil rights groups. Law enforcement officials have investigated voters who signed petitions to get the measure onto the ballot, while a state health agency has created a webpage attacking the amendment. Maryland Legislators, rather than citizens, initiated Maryland’s measure, which would amend the state constitution to confirm individuals’ “right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end the individual’s pregnancy”. Like Colorado, Maryland has become an abortion haven because it permits the procedure throughout pregnancy. It is also relatively close to the deep south, which is blanketed in bans. Missouri Abortion opponents went to court to stop Missouri’s measure from appearing on voters’ ballots, but the state supreme court rejected their arguments and agreed to let voters decide whether the Missouri constitution should guarantee the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which is the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive healthcare, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions”. Missouri, which was the first state to ban abortion after Roe fell, only permits the procedure in medical emergencies. If the measure passes, it is expected to roll back that ban and permit abortion until viability. Montana In the years since Roe fell, Montana courts and its Republican-dominated legislature have wrestled over abortion restrictions and whether the right to privacy embedded in Montana’s constitution includes the right to abortion. Abortion remains legal until viability in Montana, but the measure would amend the state constitution to explicitly include “a right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion” up until viability. Providers could perform an abortion after viability to protect a patient’s life or health. Nebraska Nebraska, which bans abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy, is the lone state with two competing ballot measures this November. One of the measures would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability into the state constitution, while the other would enshrine the current ban. If both measures pass, the measure that garners the most votes would take effect. Nevada Alongside Arizona, Nevada is one of the most closely watched states in the presidential election. Its measure would amend the state constitution to protect individuals’ right to abortion up until viability, or after viability in cases where a patient’s health or life may be threatened. Nevada already permits abortion up until 26 weeks of pregnancy. New York New York state legislators added a measure to the ballot to broaden the state’s anti-discrimination laws by adding, among other things, protections against discrimination on the basis of “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health”. Although sky-blue New York passed a law protecting reproductive rights in 2019, advocates say this measure could be used to defend abortion rights against future challenges. However, the ballot language before voters will not include the word “abortion”, leading advocates to fear voters will not understand what they are voting on. Democrats pushed to add the word “abortion” to the description of the measure, but a judge rejected the request, ruling that the amendment poses “complex interpretive questions” and its exact impact on abortion rights is unclear. South Dakota South Dakota’s measure is less sweeping than other abortion rights measures, because it would only protect the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Under this measure, South Dakota could regulate access to abortion “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman” in the second trimester of pregnancy. In the third trimester, the state could ban abortion except in medical emergencies. Right now, South Dakota only allows abortions in such emergencies. Although this measure will appear on the ballot, there will be a trial over the validity of the signatures that were collected for it. Depending out the outcome of the trial, the measure – and any votes cast for it – could be invalidated.","2024-09-26T11:00:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/election-abortion-ballot-measures-states"
"abortion","Tracking abortion ballot measures: Missouri and Arizona expand rights as Florida vote falls short","Americans in 10 US states voted on Tuesday on whether to enshrine the right to abortion into their state constitutions. In a major victory, Missouri voted to amend its state constitution to protect abortion rights – a move that sets the state up to become the first since the fall of Roe v Wade to overturn its near-total abortion ban. So too did voters in the swing state of Arizona, which approved a ballot measure that would establish a fundamental right to abortion and prohibit the state from restricting or banning abortion before 24 weeks – a victory for activists who sought to expand access beyond 15 weeks. Similar decisions in Montana – which enshrined a 1999 state supreme court ruling that said the constitutional right to privacy protects the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice – and in Nevada, a presidential battleground state, added to the list of major wins for abortion rights supporters. Colorado, New York and Maryland also all passed measures to amend their state constitutions to protect abortion rights and cement the blue states’ status as abortion havens. However, in Florida, an effort to roll back a six-week ban fell short, as did to expands protections in Nebraska and North Dakota. Before Tuesday, seven states had held abortion-related ballot referendums, and abortion rights supporters won all of them before Florida broke their streak. The results of Tuesday’s measures will not be the final word; states that vote to overturn bans will see litigation or legislation before those bans are repealed. Donald Trump’s return to the White House will also significantly shape the future of abortion access in the United States. The final vote counts are still processing, updated as of 8.45am ET on 13 November. Arizona In a major victory for abortion rights supporters in Arizona, a key battleground state in the presidential election, voters approved their ballot measure to establish a fundamental right to abortion and prohibit the state from restricting or banning abortion before fetal viability, or about 24 weeks, in the state constitution. Abortion is currently banned in the state after 15 weeks. Colorado Colorado voters passed a measure to amend the state constitution to block the state government from denying, impeding or discriminating against individuals’ “right to abortion”. The amendment also repeals a provision in the state constitution that bans public funding for abortions. There is currently no gestational limit on the right to abortion in the state. Florida Florida shattered a string of success. A measure to roll back the state’s six-week ban by adding the right to an abortion up until viability to the state’s constitution had amassed a clear majority, 57% of the vote, at the time it was called by the Associated Press. However, it needed 60% to pass, the highest threshold of any of the ballots. Maryland Voters in Maryland approved a measure to amend the state constitution to confirm individuals’ “right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end the individual’s pregnancy”. There is currently no gestational limit on the right to abortion in the state. Missouri Voters decided to overturn the state’s current, near-total abortion ban and establish a constitutional guarantee to the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom”, including abortion care until fetal viability. Montana Abortion in Montana is currently legal, following a 1999 state supreme court ruling – and voters chose to amend the state constitution to explicitly include “a right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy”. That includes the right to abortion up until fetal viability, or after viability to protect a patient’s life or health. Though there’s no defined time frame, doctors say viability is sometime around 24 weeks. Nebraska Nebraska was the lone state with two competing ballot measures. The first, which did not pass, would have enshrined the right to abortion up until viability into the state constitution. The second one, which passed, will enshrine the current 12-week ban. Nevada Nevada voted to amend its state constitution to protect the right to abortion up until viability, or after viability in cases where a patient’s health or life may be threatened. Voters must also approve the ballot question in 2026 in order to amend the state constitution. The political action committee Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom organized the ballot initiative and gathered enough signatures to put the question before voters. Although a 1990 state law makes abortion available up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, supporters in Nevada and elsewhere have been pressing to strengthen abortion access after Roe v Wade was overturned. New York New York voters approved a measure to broaden the state’s anti-discrimination laws by adding, among other things, protections against discrimination on the basis of “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health”. It does not explicitly reference abortion, but advocates say its pregnancy-related language encompasses abortion protections. Abortion is protected in New York until fetal viability. South Dakota South Dakota voters rejected a proposal to add protections for abortion rights to the state constitution. The outcome preserves a state law that makes it a felony to perform an abortion except to save the life of the mother. The ban took effect when the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and allowed states to outlaw abortion. South Dakota’s measure was less sweeping than other abortion rights measures, because it would only have protected the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. • The Florida graph in this article was amended on 7 November 2024; an earlier version had the Yes and No percentages the wrong way round.","2024-11-06T11:04:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/05/abortion-ballot-results-tracker-ban-states"
"abortion","Harris calls for end to Senate filibuster to restore US abortion rights","Kamala Harris has called for an end to the Senate filibuster to make good on her pledge to restore the right to abortion through legislation. The US vice-president, herself a former senator, told a radio station in Wisconsin that eliminating the filibuster – which sets a 60-vote threshold in the 100-seat upper chamber of the US Congress – would be necessary to codify the rights that were enshrined in Roe v Wade, the 1973 supreme court ruling that upheld the right to legal abortion throughout the US until it was overturned by a ruling two years ago. “I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom, and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body – and not have their government tell them what to do,” Harris told WPR, an affiliate of National Public Radio, on a campaign trip to Wisconsin, a key midwestern swing state where she has a wafer-thin lead over Donald Trump, according to recent polls. Her remarks accentuated her determination to put abortion rights at the heart of her campaign message amid polling evidence that it is a priority for many women voters. However, it cost her the support of the outgoing West Virginia senator, Joe Manchin – a former Democrat who left the party this year to become an independent – who said he would not endorse her candidacy because of her pledge. “Shame on her,” Manchin, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of the year, told CNN. “She knows the filibuster is the holy grail of democracy. It’s the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.” Trump has been on the defensive on abortion because the 2022 supreme court ruling was achieved with the votes of three conservative justices he appointed to the bench when he was president. Harris has claimed that Trump would sign a nationwide ban if he re-captured the White House, although he insists he would leave it to individual states. Harris’s use of a radio interview to underline her commitment follows criticism that she was deliberately avoiding high-profile interviews – a charge Harris has sought to counter by making herself available to selected media in battleground states. Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday that he would be women’s “protectors” and that they would not “be thinking about abortion” if he won a second term. Harris’s filibuster remarks echoed a similar comment by Joe Biden immediately after Roe v Wade was struck down, when he said an exception to the time-honoured Senate rule had to be made to guarantee abortion rights. “I believe we have to codify Roe v Wade in the law,” he said. “And the way to do that is to make sure the Congress votes to do that. And if the filibuster gets in the way, it’s like voting rights – it should be (that) we provide an exception to this … requiring an exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the supreme court decision.” Harris has previously advocated overriding the filibuster to pass additional voting rights laws and Green New Deal legislation. In 2020, Barack Obama described the filibuster as a “Jim Crow relic” from America’s racially segregated past and argued that it should be eliminated if used to block voting reform. The filibuster describes the use of prolonged debate to delay or prevent a vote on a bill. It can be invoked by any senator objecting to a bill and has been used with increasing regularity in recent decades. It can only be overridden by triggering “cloture”, which requires a three-fifths majority vote – or 60 of the 100 senators. If cloture passes, it enables a vote on the original measure the filibuster was designed to block. The longest filibuster in Senate history was achieved by Strom Thurmond, the pro-segregationist South Carolina senator, when he spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in an effort to block civil rights legislation in 1957. Thurmond’s speech – described by his biographer as a “urological mystery” – was reportedly achieved with help of prior steam baths to dehydrate his body and preclude the need for regular bathroom breaks. He was also reported by a staffer to have had himself fitted with a catheter to relieve himself while he spoke.","2024-09-24T19:40:46Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/24/election-harris-filibuster-abortion-roe"
"abortion","Planned Parenthood may not survive the Trump administration","Planned Parenthood, the massive, 108-year-old network of women’s and reproductive health clinics that operates almost 600 health centers across the United States, may not survive the Trump administration. Long a hated symbol on the right, and unable to summon enthusiastic support from the left, the medical network has nevertheless remained a symbolic and material cornerstone of women’s equality, serving millions of patients – many of them indigent or low-income – each year, and housing one of the biggest feminist and pro-choice lobbying and litigation shops in America, in addition to being one of the nation’s largest healthcare providers. Since returning to power in January, the Trump administration has made repeated cuts targeting Planned Parenthood’s clinics, excluding the group from the vast Title X family planning program, on the pretext of scurrilous claims that they have violated federal anti-discrimination law by adopting resolutions stressing their “commitment to Black communities” and by providing medical treatment to undocumented immigrants. Now, the supreme court has struck another blow. Last week, the court ruled that patients cannot sue to challenge their states’ exclusion of Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. The ruling threatens to transform the Medicaid program, giving states leeway to ban Medicaid reimbursements to any practice that provides politically disfavored medicine – notably abortion, but potentially also including contraception, IVF, gender-affirming care, or HIV treatment. The court functionally nullifies a clause in the bill that established the Medicaid program, which gives patients the right to seek care from “any qualified provider” of their choosing. Now, the choice of provider can be dramatically limited by the state on the basis of that provider’s political beliefs. The ruling also dramatically weakens section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, a landmark Reconstruction-era law that allows for citizens to sue states that deprive them of federally protected rights – raising the troubling prospect that the court will look askance at citizens’ ability to enforce their constitutional rights against states that are disdainful of them. In the process, the court provided states with yet another way to choke off Planned Parenthood’s funding, and to deprive their residents – particularly women – of the healthcare that they need to live safe, healthy and dignified lives. Many states – most – will now probably proceed to do so. The case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, concerns South Carolina’s decision to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. State funding of abortions is not at issue: abortion is banned in South Carolina, and even before it was, the state did not provide Medicaid coverage for abortions out of its state funds. (Federal money is not used to pay for abortions, either: a budget rider known as the Hyde Amendment has prevented federal Medicaid funding from covering abortion care since 1977, in effect prohibiting low-income women from accessing the procedure under their government healthcare plans.) What is at issue, rather, is whether Planned Parenthood, which provides a wide array of services for a disproportionately low-income clientele, can be prohibited from receiving reimbursement for other services that they provide – like pap smears, prenatal care and STD testing. Planned Parenthood challenged their own exclusion by the law in tandem with a Medicaid patient who went to them seeking birth control; because she chose a provider that her state government had a disdain for, she was denied. The suit questioned whether the plaintiffs could sue to enforce the right of patients to choose their own providers. Writing for the court’s six-justice majority of Republican-appointed judges, Neil Gorsuch found that they can’t. In practice, this decision enables an aggressive expansion of the states’ power to put the political preferences of Republican lawmakers between women and gender-nonconforming people and their doctors. Delivered the day after the third anniversary of Dobbs, the decision expands the court’s attack on abortion rights by granting states broad latitude to exclude abortion providers from the government subsidy programs that structure much of American healthcare: in practice, this will make abortion provision even more prohibitively expensive and onerous for doctors and practices, and will shutter many clinics. The ruling also comes on the heels of Skrimetti, the court’s ruling upholding bans on transition-related healthcare for minors, on the absurd claim that such laws are somehow not sex discrimination. Collectively, the cases illustrate a judicial agenda that is not just vehemently anti-choice, but aggressively gender prescriptive: willing to use the levers of medicine and its regulation to enforce a narrow and regressive vision of gender roles, from identity to sexuality to gestation. The decision comes at a moment when Donald Trump’s domestic policy agenda, known humiliatingly as the “big, beautiful bill,” is working its way through the Senate, which among other things is considering a provision to ban Planned Parenthood from all Medicaid reimbursements nationwide. The organization has said that as a result of the supreme court and Trump administration actions, nearly a third of their clinics – about 200 – may have to close; the group has already decided to close 20 clinics just this year. The result is a de facto ban not just on abortion, but on any healthcare provision by pro-choice providers for vast swaths of American women. One in three women in the US has received services from Planned Parenthood; more than half of American Black women have. When combined with the independent reproductive health clinics that will also be excluded from Medicaid due to their abortion politics, that number rises higher. These Medicaid-enrolled women have now been denied the right to choose a doctor for their most intimate care based on their own comfort and values: instead, they will be forced to choose one based on the whims and bigotries of elected Republicans. In her dissent for the court’s three Democratic appointees, Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the decision will strip patients “of a deeply personal freedom: ‘the ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable’”. Instead, those vulnerable patients will probably be pushed, in growing numbers, toward religiously affiliated groups that deceive rather than treat. While abortion-providing medical practices like Planned Parenthood are being pushed out of Medicaid, the program is giving more and more money to crisis pregnancy centers, the Christian fake clinics that lure in frightened women, lie to them about their health, do not provide comprehensive care, and often lack any doctors on staff. These fake clinics, which are lavishly funded and outnumber real reproductive health centers nationwide at a rate of three to one, are not a substitute for real healthcare. But they are a means of restricting women’s freedom. For the court, that’s good enough.

"abortion","South Australia’s upper house narrowly rejects ‘Trumpian’ bill to wind back abortion care","A child that faces a bedridden life. A girl with intellectual disabilities raped by a family member. Victims of domestic violence or reproductive coercion. There are a variety of distressing reasons women have later stage terminations. There is no easy definition of when an abortion is considered “late” or “late-term”. It is generally considered anything after 20 weeks’ gestation, but the states and territories have a patchwork of legislation with various milestones. What is clear is that later terminations are the new target of anti-abortion activists, now that abortion has been decriminalised across Australia. On Wednesday South Australia’s upper house held a conscience vote on legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days – an extremely rare occurrence – to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. The bill was narrowly defeated with 10 votes opposed to 9 in favour. In dramatic late-night scenes, the Liberal MP Michelle Lensink, a vocal opponent of the bill, was prepared to race in to parliament to vote even though she is on leave for cancer treatment. She believed her Liberal colleague Jing Lee would pair her vote – a long-standing convention when votes are close and someone cannot attend. Lensink says she was watching the debate when Lee told her she didn’t want to proceed with the pair. Lensink was then talking to One Nation MLC Sarah Game, and Lensink claims Game agreed to pair, but then also withdrew. Lensink says she considered rushing in. “I got in an Uber, just in case, then I got the call ‘you don’t have to come’,” she told ABC radio. At the last minute, the conservative Liberal MLC Dennis Hood – formerly of the Family First party and a passionate supporter of the bill – agreed to be the pair. The attorney general, Kyam Maher, described Hood as a politician he relied on to keep his word. “It was an entirely honourable thing to do,” he said. Hood said Lensink had previously paired him on a conscience vote when he was ill. “So I said to her if you ever need the favour returned I will do the right thing by you.” Game said a conscience vote was inflammatory and that “you cannot rely on someone else being willing to pair out with you”. She said she spoke to Lensink about pairing as she thought it might be a parliamentary requirement. But when she found out it was not, she told Lensink she would not pair. “Out of respect for her, I made sure she was informed that wouldn’t be happening to give her the best chance to see if someone else would,” she said. “I’m pro-life, this is not something where I would walk out and not have it count unless that was required. She might have been in some sort of confusion for a few minutes.” Guardian Australia has contacted Lee for comment. The Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood, who introduced the bill, says the woman’s right to end a pregnancy is kept because the pregnancy ends when the baby is born. “The innovation of this bill is that it allows a mother to end her pregnancy throughout all nine months and indeed right up to birth,” he says. The Greens have a different label for it: “forced birth”. About 1% of all terminations are carried out after 20 weeks. According to SA Health data gathered in the 18 months after abortion reform in the state, fewer than five terminations were performed after 27 weeks. Terminations at that point can only be done with the approval of two doctors, and only if it is necessary to save the life of the pregnant person or save another foetus, or poses significant risk of injury or mental health of the pregnant person, or if there is a significant risk of serious foetal anomalies. Ben Hood said in the upper house on Wednesday night that his bill did not “force birth”. He said any termination at 28 weeks already involved “birth” because women had no other option in how to remove the foetus from the body. “The only difference is that the baby will have a chance to live,” he said. He has previously said that, once born, if the baby “isn’t compatible with life”, it would then be given palliative care. He said on Wednesday night the babies would be admitted to neonatal units, “receiving the best medical attention available if the mother does not wish to keep the baby”. Adoption would be a compassionate alternative, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Maher says the “Trumpian” bill would wind back abortion care and poses a “real and significant danger, not only to the physical health and safety of all women, but to women’s fundamental right to bodily autonomy”. He also hit out at the vitriol, nastiness and inflammatory attacks deployed in the campaign. “I’d encourage those who’ve been involved in this sort of debate to reflect on whether the hyper polarised US style of personal politics really reflects well on SA,” he says. The bill bears similarities to so-called “born-alive” laws, which have percolated in the US for years. A federal “born alive” bill in Australia was found to have no legal, ethical or medical basis to support it. The Katter’s Australian party leader, Robbie Katter, has proposed similar legislation in Queensland. Both Katter and Ben Hood have thanked the anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe for her work on their legislation. Howe wants “an Australia where abortion is unthinkable”. Hood thanked Howe on Wednesday and said the other people who informed the bill wanted to remain anonymous. Several earlier speakers noted that Hood’s bill was drafted by Howe and anonymous experts while the review that informed decriminalisation involved thousands of experts and many respected institutions who did not remain anonymous, and that it involved months of investigation and a 560-page report. Abortion has also crept up as a serious issue in the lead-up to the Queensland election after Labor accused the Liberal National party of a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and the LNP failed to quell the speculation. The various campaigns have been accused of using misinformation in an attempt to limit access to terminations. Reasons women might need a late termination include foetal abnormalities, life-threatening conditions, and psycho-social reasons such as the baby being the result of rape or incest. ‘We can’t do this to the baby’ Tiffany’s first baby had spina bifida. Her baby would have been paralysed from the neck down. She chose a termination. Six years later, Tiffany* was pregnant again. At the 20-week scan, she was told this baby also had spina bifida, but it was not as bad. “They said wait another two weeks, we’ll do another scan and we’ll go from there,” she says. “You’re stressing, you’re freaking out. Two weeks felt like an eternity.” After waiting two weeks and undergoing another scan, Tiffany was again told it didn’t look too bad and she should do another scan in two weeks. “At 24 weeks, it got worse,” she says. “He started developing fluid on the brain. It was affecting his nerves, down the spine. It went from numb toes to ‘he’s not going to be able to walk’.” Another two weeks, another scan. “Everything was failing,” she says. “We did all these tests because I needed to make sure I was making the right decision … we sat down and said ‘we can’t do this to the baby’. He’d be bedridden, have surgery after surgery, a lifetime of hospital visits.” At 28 weeks, she had the procedure. An SA Law Reform Institute review of abortion law heard about a girl with an intellectual disability who had been sexually abused by a family member and did not realise she was pregnant until late in the pregnancy. She made it clear she did not want the pregnancy to proceed. If she had not been able to have an abortion, if she had been forced to have the child, it would have had a “severe and adverse affect on her”, the institute said in its report. Jacquie* and her husband had a two-year-old and another baby on the way. They did the usual testing, including a 16-week scan and an amniocentesis. “We got the results back and they said everything was fine,” she says. “But I had a gut feeling and remember saying to my hubby that something was just off.” At 24 weeks, they got a call. “They said they got the results wrong,” she says. “We thought, ‘shit’. So we were told at 24 weeks that our child did have Down syndrome and we had to make a choice within 24 hours. “We just had to make the decision around our family and what was best for us. To this day we never say it was the right decision. It was the best choice for us at that time. We had to think about our little one.” Jacob Mangelsdorf is a counsellor at Red Tree Foundation, an organisation which supports people grieving the loss of a child. He says the parents that come to him are suffering an “incredibly complex grief”. “We’re not talking about an easy choice. We’re not talking about something that’s without a high level of complexity,” he says. “It’s not just losing that baby, it’s about processing that loss and the decision, [thinking] ‘in some ways I made that choice to end that baby’s life’. “There’s always that little part of their brain grappling with that. It’s really important to acknowledge that the mum at that point has had 20-something weeks to bond with that baby.” Tiffany says hospitals and health authorities need to do better in supporting women going through horrific experiences like hers. And people need to stop judging others, she says. “Everyone has an opinion and their own beliefs. “But if you’re not in my shoes, you don’t know.” * Full names have not been used to maintain privacy of those interviewed • The Red Nose grief and loss support line is available 24/7 for anyone affected by the loss of a pregnancy, stillbirth or death of a baby or child on 1300 308 307 • In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732) and the national family violence counselling service on 1800 737 732.

"abortion","With Trump returning to the presidency, everything from abortion to immigration is under threat","With Donald Trump returning to the White House for a second term as president, the impact will be felt in many aspects of American life and also across the world. From abortion, to immigration, the environment, gun laws and LGBTQ+ rights: all are at stake with Trump and his allies back in power. Here is a list of the main threats Trump represents: Idaho’s extreme abortion ban could go nationwide When the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, it paved the way for more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions. While these bans allow for abortion in emergencies, the language and fear of criminal consequences mean doctors are forced to wait and watch as patients grow sicker. Now, it’s possible federal restrictions on abortion are next. Although Trump’s stance on a national ban isn’t entirely clear – he has repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue – his administration wouldn’t need Congress to attack abortion access nationwide. Project 2025, the rightwing playbook for a second Trump term, proposes using the 1873 Comstock Act, which outlaws the mailing of abortion-related materials, to ban people from shipping abortion pills. These pills account for about two-thirds of US abortions. If enacted to its fullest extent, the Comstock Act could not only ban pills but the very equipment that clinics need to do their jobs, and Trump could use the legislation to implement a nationwide de facto abortion ban. Trump could also weaken the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala), a federal law that protects emergency abortion access. Idaho’s extreme abortion ban has been at the center of a legal debate over the law, which recently reached the supreme court. The court restored the right of Idaho doctors to perform a broader range of emergency abortions, but left the door open to reconsider Emtala in the future. Read the full article Mass deportations could wreak havoc on immigrants Raids and mass deportations lie at the heart of Trump’s vision for a second term. He has promised to restore and expand his most controversial immigration policies, including the travel ban aimed at mostly Muslim countries. He has consistently promised to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history”. It’s a refrain he repeated so often that “Mass deportations now!” became a rallying cry at this summer’s Republican national convention. Trump has offered few details of his plan to expel “maybe as many as 20 million” people. But in public remarks and interviews, he and his allies have detailed a vision that matches plans laid out in Project 2025. The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of 18th-century wartime powers. Immigrant advocates and leaders say they are better prepared and more organized than they were in his first term. Groups are already considering legal action against key pieces of his immigration agenda and activists say they have learned how to harness public outcry. Read the full article Trump could launch a ‘catastrophic’ rollback of LGBTQ+ rights In his first term, Trump banned trans people from the military. If re-elected, he has promised even more aggressive attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. Trump pledges to order all federal agencies to end programs that “promote … gender transition at any age”, cut funding from hospitals providing gender-affirming care, push for a federal law stating the government doesn’t legally recognize trans people and rescind federal LGBTQ+ non-discrimination policies. Project 2025, meanwhile, calls for replacing Biden-Harris policies with those that support “heterosexual, intact marriage”. Legal scholars warn that marriage equality could further be threatened under Trump, especially if he has the chance to appoint additional justices. Read the full article He will doom efforts to slow the climate disaster In his first term, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords, undermining the progress the talks had produced. In his second term, Trump would be a disaster for efforts to slow the climate crisis. Project 2025 outlined the myriad ways his administration could harm environmental policy, from bolstering oil, gas and coal to closing down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency that measures how much the temperature is rising. Trump, who has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and “one of the great scams of all time”, has promised to “drill, baby, drill” and end Biden’s pause on liquefied natural gas export terminals, among other things. And his four-year term arrives at precisely the moment the Earth most needs to accelerate efforts to curb climate change. Climate scientists say emissions must be cut by 2030 for a chance at a Paris pathway. Trump’s term would extend until 2029. The climate effects may not be immediate but will be felt for years to come. Read the full article Freedom of the press will be under threat In his first term and as a candidate, Trump has consistently attacked the mainstream press and used conservative media for his political purposes. He threatened to weaken libel laws and called the press “fake news” and the “enemy of the people”. There’s nothing to suggest a re-elected Trump would tone down his aggression. In recent weeks, Trump demanded that CBS News be stripped of its broadcast license as punishment for airing an edited answer of an interview with his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, and he threatened that other broadcasters ought to suffer the same fate. This rhetoric, along with Trump’s past actions, prompted one science journalist to consider whether press freedom and democracy should be added to the “endangered list”. Read the full article Sensible gun-safety policies could be revoked As president, Joe Biden oversaw the passage of the first major federal gun-safety law in almost three decades. Now, advocates fear that those policies could be easily reversed if Trump and congressional Republicans win this election. In a second term, advocates expect him to immediately close the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created in 2023 and overseen by Kamala Harris, and nominate a gun industry-friendly leader as director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He could also disrupt implementation of the law Biden signed and wind back some of his administration’s efforts to broaden background checks. The gun-safety advocate Angela Ferrell-Zabala says a second Trump term would mean having to “fight like hell” to secure progress made on “common basic gun-safety measures”. Read the full article US cities are at risk of military takeovers Trump has threatened to use presidential powers to seize control of cities largely run by Democrats, to use federal immigration agents to carry out mass deportations, and to obliterate the progressive criminal justice policies of left-leaning prosecutors. He threatened to deploy the national guard to combat urban protests and crime – and wouldn’t wait to be called in by mayors or governors but would act unilaterally. “In cities where there has been a complete breakdown of law and order … I will not hesitate to send in federal assets including the national guard until safety is restored,” Trump says in his campaign platform. Mayors and prosecutors in several US cities are collaborating over strategies to minimize the fallout. But as Levar Stoney, the Democratic mayor of Richmond, Virginia, said: “It’s very difficult to autocrat-proof your city.” Read the full article Biden-era accomplishments like the Inflation Reduction Act would be repealed Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, called the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act – the $370bn bill aimed at accelerating the move to clean energy – a “green energy scam”. That’s despite the millions in climate investments made in Vance’s home town in Middletown, Ohio. Republicans in Congress have attempted to gut the legislation and Project 2025 has called for it to be repealed under Trump. Read the full article Public lands would be opened up to oil and gas production Early plans suggest a re-elected Trump would gut the Department of the Interior, the agency responsible for national parks, wildlife refuges and the protection of endangered species. The department is the focus of one chapter of Project 2025, the policy document that also calls for reinstating Trump’s energy-dominant agenda, reducing national monument designations and weakening protections for endangered species. In office, it’s likely Trump would reverse the efforts made by the Biden administration on the green transition and protecting public lands. A second Trump term could cut regulations, weaken environmental protections and, in Trump’s words, “drill, baby, drill”. Read the full article US protest movements could face serious crackdowns Since George Floyd’s death in 2020 and the resulting racial justice protests, Republican-led states have expanded anti-protest laws – a push that comes from Trump, the party’s standard-bearer. Trump campaigned on a platform that includes suppressing protests and has vowed to bring in the national guard where “law and order” has broken down. Meanwhile, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a key Trump ally, called for the national guard to be used against students protesting against Israel’s invasion of Gaza. In his second term, Trump could direct a militarized response to protests and pressure congressional Republicans to pass legislation that would impose nationwide penalties like those already in effect in Tennessee; the Republican-led state passed a bill that, among other things, created a new felony for protest encampments on state property. Read the full article He would bring instability to foreign policy During his first term, Trump’s brand of “America first” politics created instability among both partners and adversaries. Nato members said that never before had the US been seen as the “unpredictable ally”. His second term could bring more instability to a time when conflicts – including the widening war in the Middle East and the continuing Russia-Ukraine war – are raging around the world. In 2018, Trump hinted at leaving Nato in an effort to force member countries to increase their defense spending. This year, he implied he would let Russia do “whatever the hell they want” to countries he says are not contributing enough to Nato. A Trump win would be likely to threaten Nato cohesion. Trump is also likely to be surrounded by “advisers who are hawkish on China and very likely pro-Taiwan”, says Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. However, Blanchette says, it’s likely US-China relations would have been strained even if Harris were elected to the White House. Benjamin Netanyahu, would not have to deal with US opposition to greater Israeli control of the West Bank. Annexation of the West Bank would become a “much more active possibility” under Trump, said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. It’s less clear whether a Trump win would see the Israeli prime minister recruit the US for a decisive attack on Iran’s nuclear programme, a longstanding goal of the Israeli leader.

"abortion","Peter Dutton rules out Coalition abortion policy changes and blasts MPs for stirring debate","Peter Dutton has blasted Coalition MPs for fuelling a federal debate on abortion laws, declaring there would be no change to policy if he wins government and they must show more “discipline” on the topic. Dutton told MPs in his private weekly party-room address on Tuesday morning that the 11th-hour emergence of the issue during the recent Queensland state election campaign may have cost the Liberal National party votes. One Coalition MP, speaking anonymously, told Guardian Australia that Dutton spoke “very firmly” on the issue in the context of the coming federal election, due by May, and warned against people speaking out, without singling out individuals. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Northern Territory Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price reopened debate at the federal level two weeks ago after she gave a media interview condemning later-term abortion, which she described as anything after the first trimester, and said full-term termination “becomes infanticide”. Later-term abortion is a non-medical term for terminations after 20 weeks’ gestation, according to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and can happen because of foetal abnormalities or if the mother’s life is at risk. The first trimester is 12 weeks. Her comments came after the issue had emerged during the Queensland election campaign and dominated debate in the lead-up to polling day. Price’s public intervention, which was not authorised by the Coalition leadership, prompted senior colleagues to speak out immediately, saying there was no proposed change to the parties’ policy. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, the opposition finance spokesperson, Jane Hume, and the Nationals’ Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, all rejected any suggestion that abortion should be reopened as an issue at the federal level. Even Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who has pressed for changes to abortion law, said after Price’s comments that timing was important and it would be unhelpful to reopen debate before a federal election. On Tuesday, Dutton is understood to have addressed his remarks to all Liberal and Nationals parliamentarians, though most senators were not present due to estimates committee hearings. Price was among those who did not attend the meeting. “[He said] it is not a federal issue, it had an impact in Queensland and discipline is extremely important,” one MP reported Dutton as saying. Dutton is believed to have also said he understands that some people in the Coalition have strong views but that nothing could be gained by airing them as it is “a state issue”. “The government will try and run a scare campaign on it, so don’t take the bait” is how the MP characterised the message. The opposition leader said Coalition MPs should not be drawn into debate on the issue by Labor, warning it was a “distraction” that could result in lost votes. One member said the party needed to be attuned to “city tactics” while praising the party’s election performance in north Queensland. Attracting strong support in Dutton’s home state of Queensland is crucial to the Coalition’s chances of taking government at the coming federal election, which is due to be held by May next year. Speaking to ABC radio on 22 October, just days before the Queensland election, Dutton downplayed the likely impact of the abortion debate on voter sentiment. “To be honest, I don’t think it’s a debate that is shifting votes one way or the other,” he said at the time. In Queensland, the debate was sparked by Katter’s Australian party MP Robbie Katter suggesting he would press an incoming LNP government to legislate to wind back aspects of the state’s abortion law. The then opposition leader – now premier – David Crisafulli faced sustained questioning over his position, condemning Labor for inflaming what he said was a scare campaign and eventually ruling out any change to the law.","2024-11-05T01:15:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/05/peter-dutton-liberal-coalition-abortion-policy-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Trump administration accuses UK of failing to uphold human rights","The Trump administration has accused the UK of backsliding on human rights over the past year, citing antisemitic violence and “serious restrictions” on free speech. The annual US state department assessment, which analyses human rights conditions worldwide, highlighted laws limiting speech around abortion clinics, as well as the way government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech” online after the 2024 Southport attack. The report stated: “The government sometimes took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, but prosecution and punishment for such abuses was inconsistent.” The report cited the “safe access zones” around abortion clinics, which it said “could include prohibitions on efforts to influence … even through prayer or silent protests”. Criticism over the handling of free speech – in particular relating to regulations on online hate speech – was also directed at the governments of Germany and France. A UK government spokesperson said: “Free speech is vital for democracy around the world, including here in the UK, and we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.” The document, previously seen as the most comprehensive study of its kind, has been significantly rewritten and downscaled by the Trump administration, including in areas such as government corruption and LGBTQ+ rights. It spares criticism for US allies such as Israel and El Salvador while escalating disapproval of perceived foes such as Brazil and South Africa. The document was published after months of delay amid reports of internal dissent at the state department over its contents. It echoed claims previously voiced by the US vice-president, JD Vance. In February, he criticised the UK over a legal case in which a former serviceman, Adam Smith-Connor, who silently prayed outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in 2022, was convicted of breaching the safe zone around the centre. In a wider attack on what he suggested was a shift away from democratic values across Europe, Vance claimed the “basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular” were under threat. Speaking at the Munich security conference, Vance said that the US’s “very dear friends the United Kingdom” appeared to have seen a “backslide in conscience rights”. Vance is taking a holiday in the Cotswolds in south-west England, an area that is becoming increasingly popular with the rich and famous. During the trip, he has been hosted by David Lammy for talks about Gaza and other international affairs at the foreign secretary’s official residence, Chevening, in Kent. Vance also invited the Conservative shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, to a meeting at the house where he is staying. The report also said the government “effectively” enforced laws around freedom of association and the rights of workers.","2025-08-13T07:24:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/13/trump-administration-accuses-uk-of-failing-to-uphold-human-rights"
"abortion","Project 2025 architect compared abortion to slavery and the Holocaust","In a speech earlier this year, Kevin Roberts, the architect of Project 2025, a vast plan for a second Trump administration, compared abortion to slavery, lynchings, the Holocaust, antisemitic violence and terror attacks. “Every slave auction, every lynching, every concentration camp, every abortion mill, every pogrom, every terrorist bombing from the Middle East to Kermit Gosnell, from Herod to Hitler to Hamas, has been justified on the same inhuman pretense that the victims aren’t really people,” Roberts said. The remarks were reported by Media Matters for America, a progressive watchdog. Gosnell, an abortion doctor in Philadelphia, was sentenced to life in prison in 2013, for the murder of three babies. Roberts is the president of the Heritage Foundation, a hard-right thinktank. He spoke about abortion in Washington DC in January, at the National Pro-Life Summit, hosted by Students for Life in America, a Project 2025 advisory board member. Project 2025 is a 900-plus-page policy plan for rightwing change at every level of federal government. The Heritage Foundation has coordinated such plans since 1980 but Democrats and progressive groups have successfully raised alarm over Project 2025, regarding reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental protections and other concerns. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the Democratic nominees for president and vice-president, have made Project 2025 a key part of their campaign, their attacks echoed by candidates for Congress and state posts. Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and key advisers have sought to back away. Earlier this week, a Trump spokesperson told the Washington Post, which reported links between Trump and Roberts including shared flights, Project 2025 “has never and will never be an accurate reflection of President Trump’s policies”. Efforts to limit damage continue. Last month the Project 2025 director, Paul Dans, stepped down, reportedly under pressure from Trump’s campaign. Earlier this week, as Democrats in Congress demanded publication of Project 2025 plans for the first 180 days of a second Trump administration, which remain under wraps, a book by Roberts and introduced by Vance was delayed until after election day. On Thursday, Roberts told a podcast it was “good” to see such moves, adding: “I mean, they’re trying to win an election. Also, legally it’s important for people to know that Project 2025 is independent of any candidate … we’ve put this together for any candidate to lean on.” But his January remarks about abortion added fuel to the fire. Then, Roberts said: “The butcher’s bill of history is chillingly clear. Once a society deems certain individuals not fully human, it soon treats them as if they weren’t human at all. And it never stops with one group. “… Is it any surprise that the same party of death celebrating violence in the womb also justifies, and even cheers, the surgical mutilation of children, the euthanizing of the depressed, the persecution of parents and churchgoers, even a genocidal war to exterminate the Jewish people? “Make no mistake: This idea of human inequality – that some people count and some people don’t – doesn’t come from the media or the government or the elite or the left or even Planned Parenthood. It comes straight from hell.” Earlier this week, Harris’s campaign manager, Julie Chávez Rodríguez, said: “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country. “Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real – in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.”","2024-08-09T16:03:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/09/kevin-roberts-abortion-slavery-holocaust-project-2025-trump"
"abortion","Arkansas official rejected valid abortion ballot signatures, lawsuit claims","Organizers behind a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights into the Arkansas state constitution sued a senior state official on Tuesday, accusing him of illegally rejecting the signatures they submitted in support of putting the measure on the November ballot. The group, Arkansans for Limited Government, submitted more than 101,000 signatures backing its ballot measure on 5 July, according to its lawsuit. Five days later, the Arkansas secretary of state John Thurston rejected their signatures because, he said, they failed to turn in the required paperwork, including a statement that identified any paid canvassers used by the group. In its lawsuit, Arkansans for Limited Government fired back, claiming that the group had fully complied with Arkansas law and submitted canvassers’ names. They also argued that even if they had not complied with the law, they should be given the chance to correct the paperwork. “Our compliance with the law is clear and well-documented,” Lauren Cowles, executive director of Arkansans for Limited Government, said in a statement. “The secretary of state’s refusal to count valid signatures is an affront to democracy and an attempt to undermine the will of the people.” Arkansas currently bans all abortions except in medical emergencies. Arkansans for Limited Government’s ballot measure would permit people to get abortions up until 18 weeks of pregnancy, as well as in cases of rape or incest. “We are reviewing the lawsuit and would have no further comment at this time,” Chris Powell, press secretary for the Arkansas secretary of state, said in an email. In order to go before voters in November, the ballot measure must be certified by 22 August. Arkansans for Limited Government’s lawsuit asks the Arkansas supreme court to force Thurston to start counting and verifying signatures so that the measure can meet that deadline. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, voters in states like Michigan, Ohio and Kansas have all passed ballot measures to protect abortion rights. A number of states, including Nevada, Arizona and Florida are slated to put abortion-related ballot measures before voters this November. Democrats are hoping that these measures will boost turnout among their base, while anti-abortion activists and their Republican allies have tried to squash similar measures in states like Missouri and South Dakota.","2024-07-16T20:31:21Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/16/abortion-ballot-measure-arkansas"
"abortion","Whole Woman’s Health abortion clinic offers ‘hopeful’ sanctuary for US south","With her blond hair pulled into a braided ponytail, a small gold cross slung around her neck and decked out in teal scrubs covered in cartoon frogs, Brenda Morgan was polite but firm as she doled out instructions to her clinic employees. People rarely pick up their phone if they don’t recognize the number, so you’ll probably have to leave a voicemail, Morgan advised a trio of staffers. When you leave that voicemail, she continued, never say you’re calling from Whole Woman’s Health. Instead, Morgan suggested they say something vague, like: “This is Brenda from your doctor’s office. Please give me a call back.” The last thing they want is for the wrong person to hear the voicemail and realize an abortion clinic is calling. The staffers eyed the phones on the desk. Protecting a patient’s privacy was paramount, but they had little time to perfect their voicemail technique. Less than 24 hours later, that clinic, the latest addition to the Whole Woman Health’s network of abortion clinics, would welcome its first patient. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and allowed more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions, more than 100 facilities have stopped providing abortions. New clinics have sprung up in states that still allow the procedure, but there are nowhere near enough to make up for those that shuttered. Many of those clinics are also in solidly liberal, northern states. By contrast, Whole Woman’s Health newest clinic – which quietly opened last week – is located in Petersburg, Virginia, within a purplish state that rebuked a GOP campaign to ban abortion past 15 weeks in the 2023 elections but remains ruled by a Republican governor. In opening in Petersburg, a small city perhaps best known for being home to some of the American civil war’s final battles, Whole Woman’s Health is declaring a new front in a war that has again divided the US north from south: the fight over abortion. Virginia is likely the last southern state where abortion providers can hope to open new clinics – and the need for southern, or southern-adjacent, abortion clinics has recently metastasized. On 1 May, Florida banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, decimating the last southern stronghold of abortion access. Women from Florida and its neighboring states must now travel hundreds of miles for abortions. “We didn’t open this only because of Florida,” said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of Whole Woman’s Health. “We opened this clinic because we know how many people are traveling from the region.” ‘Probably should have given up earlier’ For years, Whole Woman’s Health was the face of abortion in Texas, where it ran a handful of clinics. In 2016, the organization won a US supreme court case that toppled several Texas abortion restrictions; at the time, the decision seemed to be a sign that the war over abortion rights was turning in their favor. Eight years later, Roe is gone and Texas has banned almost all abortions. Whole Woman’s Health has closed its Texas clinics, as well as another clinic in Indiana, which has also outlawed the procedure. It was devastating – emotionally and financially. It took more than a year for Hagstrom Miller to sell buildings where her clinics had operated. (An anti-abortion group later bought one of the buildings.) Getting out of one lease, she said, cost tens of thousands of dollars. “Those operational things are real. They can take down – I mean, they almost did take down – one of the most stable, independent providers in the country,” said Hagstrom Miller, who likes to dress as loud as her politics. The day before the Petersburg clinic opened, she wore a chartreuse suit and a necklace that read “ABORTION”. The underside of her silvery hair was dyed a searing purple – a signature shade of Whole Woman’s Health, whose walls are usually painted in mauve hues. Hagstrom Miller continued: “I had to spend our organization’s reserves to do all that stuff, which kept me from being able to open something in Kansas or figure out how to help people in southern Illinois.” Over the last several months, Whole Woman’s Health has tried to start multiple abortion clinics. One, in New Mexico, successfully opened. But Hagstrom Miller purchased a building in Oklahoma – right before the state banned the procedure. “I still have that building,” Hagstrom Miller said. “I’ve been playing a mortgage on that building for – I couldn’t even tell you how long it’s been.” She also bought a practice from a North Carolina abortion provider but spent a year battling state regulations before having to concede that the clinic would never open. “Probably should have given up earlier,” she said. “Not so good at that.” A few weeks later, North Carolina banned abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy. Morgan was part of these efforts. For the last two years, she has hopscotched across the country, closing and setting up clinics as the director of growth and acquisitions for Whole Woman’s Health. During a tour of the clinic, Morgan pointed out pieces of equipment that had been repurposed from former Whole Woman’s Health locations: black chairs in the waiting room, blush-colored surgical trays, a chair where patients get their blood drawn. “If it could talk, it would tell you many, many stories,” Morgan said of an exam bed from San Antonio, Texas. Hanging in the waiting room, greeting patients as they walk in the door, is a royal purple sign bearing the “MISSION STATEMENT” of Whole Woman’s Health, which reads, in part: “We honor women’s hopes, dreams and intentions in all of the care that we provide.” Morgan stroked a finger down the sign, noting where the purple paint had faded away to reveal white underneath. The sign originally hung in a Texas clinic. “I love the fact that it has some dings in it, because it’s just like us,” Morgan said. “It’s stood the duration of time, but it also has taken its little nicks and bruises, as we have.” ‘I have to plan’ On the clinic’s first day of operation, one woman flew in from Florida. “She was so sweet and so grateful,” said Dr Meera Shah, the clinic’s medical director. “It made me angry that she had to even do that, that she had to leave Florida.” In her other job, as the chief medical officer of a Planned Parenthood affiliate in New York state, Shah said she has treated numerous patients fleeing southern abortion laws – including one Florida woman who had an ectopic pregnancy, a nonviable pregnancy where the embryo implants outside of the uterus. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture women’s fallopian tubes, leading them to hemorrhage and even die. Theoretically, abortion bans should not apply to ectopic pregnancies. But the woman had been turned away from a Florida emergency room because, Shah said, a doctor found the state’s abortion laws “confusing”. “You know, she could have ruptured,” Shah said. “The zip code in which you live really determines the type of healthcare that you’ll receive. And it shouldn’t be that way.” By the weekend, the Petersburg clinic had helped another another three people – from Florida, Georgia and Alabama – get abortions. Eventually, Morgan expects the clinic to serve about 30 to 50 patients a week. The upcoming 2024 elections, however, may scramble these plans, especially as southern abortion laws are still in flux. Floridians will vote on a ballot measure that could restore abortion access, but it needs 60% of the vote to pass. In North Carolina, a Republican who has called abortion “genocide” and “murder” is now running for governor. He has tried to soften his position on abortion recently but if he wins, North Carolina’s state government could ban abortion entirely. The same week the Petersburg clinic opened, Donald Trump pledged not to use a 19th-century anti-vice law to outlaw abortion nationwide, while his running mate JD Vance said Trump would not sign a national abortion ban. But Project 2025, an influential blueprint for a conservative presidential administration, has a long list of anti-abortion proposals. Trump could also renege on his promise. “I’m feeling much more engaged and hopeful than I have felt in a long time,” Hagstrom Miller said. “I also am absolutely terrified for Trump to get re-elected and I have to plan for that contingency. I have to plan for a national abortion ban.”","2024-08-30T12:00:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/30/whole-womans-health-abortion-clinic-virginia"
"abortion","Amber Thurman was killed by Georgia’s abortion ban. There will be others","There are other names, but this is the one we know: Amber Thurman has become the first woman whose death was preventable in relation to an abortion ban since Dobbs. Her name and story have become public as reporting by ProPublica’s Kavitha Surana details how Thurman, a Black 28-year-old mother to a young son who had dreams of becoming a nurse, died a painful, preventable death in Georgia after doctors at a hospital there refused to perform a simple procedure that could have saved her life – because the law did not allow them. The story highlights the reality of abortion bans, which – even in states like Georgia, with putative exceptions for maternal health – in practice impose death sentences on women who seek to end their pregnancies, or who experience severe complications. They force doctors to choose between medical best practices and their own legal protection – and in the process, the lives of women are treated as alarmingly disposable. Thurman, who lived in Georgia, died just weeks after her state’s abortion ban went into effect. She had just established a new degree of stability for herself and her young son when she discovered that she was pregnant with twins in 2022. As her pregnancy had already progressed beyond her state’s gestational limit, she took a road trip to North Carolina with her best friend, where a clinic gave her abortion pills. Abortion pills have very low rates of complications but rare problems do occur. In Thurman’s case, not all of the pregnancy tissue had been expelled from her uterus, and she arrived in a Georgia ER with bleeding, pain and falling blood pressure – the telltale signs of an infection. Thurman could have been cured with a D&amp;C, or dilation and curettage, a procedure in which the cervix is dilated to create an opening through which instruments can be inserted to empty out the contents of a uterus. The procedure is a popular form of abortion, but it is also a routine part of miscarriage and other gynecological care. If the tissue was promptly removed, she probably would have been fine: a D&amp;C requires no special equipment and takes only about 15 minutes. But Georgia’s abortion ban outlawed the D&amp;C procedure, making it a felony to perform except in cases of managing a “spontaneous” or “naturally occurring” miscarriage. Because Thurman had taken abortion pills, her miscarriage was illegal to treat. She suffered in a hospital bed for 20 hours, developing sepsis and beginning to experience organ failure. By the time the Georgia doctors were finally willing to treat her, it was too late. We don’t know how many other women have died because of abortion bans. Such cases are often shrouded in secrecy, stigma and confidentiality. And few families, let alone those grieving the loss of vibrant, loving young women, are willing to subject themselves to the smears and scrutiny that coming forward about abortion ban deaths will inevitably entail. But we will also not know because ban states, where these deaths are taking place, are not incentivized to reveal them. Thurman’s death was ruled preventable by a state maternal mortality review board. But it was only ProPublica’s reporting that made the cause of her death public. Not even her family were told that Amber could have been saved: the state did not bother to inform them, and they learned from ProPublica’s reporter. But even if we knew all the names of those who have been killed by abortion bans, we would still not be able to fathom the full scope of what has been taken from us. Every life – every woman’s life – is a world of possibility: these murders-by-neglect to which the law sentences women like Amber exterminate those worlds. Amber will never live her dream of going to nursing school. Her best friend, Ricaria Baker, who drove her to the North Carolina clinic, will never laugh with her again. Her mother has lost a child. Her son, who was six when Thurman died, will grow up without his mother: she will never get to know the man he becomes, and he will never get to understand her as an adult. All because the self-interest of cynical Republican politicians, the treacly, misogynist sentimentality of the anti-choice movement, and the myopic bigotry of six supreme court justices – Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts – were deemed more important than her life, her dreams, her ambitions and all the love her family had for her. We do know that there almost certainly are other women like Thurman. We may well never know their stories, their names. But we know that we are worse off without them; we know that they deserved better; we know that their lives mattered – more than politics and more than other people’s religion. We can pray for those who loved them, and we can fight for those that will come next. And we can hope, too, that Amber Thurman’s face will haunt the nightmares of those who are responsible. I know she will haunt mine. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist","2024-09-19T10:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/19/georgia-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Texas woman died after being denied miscarriage care due to abortion ban, report finds","Just days after Texas banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, a woman died after doctors in the state delayed treating her miscarriage for 40 hours, ProPublica reported on Wednesday. Experts told ProPublica that the September 2021 death of Josseli Barnica, a 28-year-old mother, was “preventable”. Barnica is the third woman reported by ProPublica to have died in recent years after being unable to access abortion legally or having her medical care delayed. Although US abortion bans – which more than a dozen states have enacted in the two years since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade – technically permit the procedure in medical emergencies, doctors across the country have said that the laws are worded so vaguely that they don’t know when they can legally intervene. Instead, many physicians say they have been forced to wait until a patient is on the brink of death – then attempt to pull them back. Barnica went to the hospital with cramps when she was just over 17 weeks pregnant on 2 September 2021, the day after the Texas six-week abortion ban took effect, according to ProPublica. (Texas enacted the ban almost a year before Roe was overturned; it now bans abortion from conception.) When her bleeding worsened the following day, Barnica returned to the hospital, where a doctor concluded that a miscarriage was “in progress”. Another soon concluded that a miscarriage was “inevitable”. Barnica’s cervix was dilated at nearly 9cm, a condition that left her vulnerable to fast-acting infections, ProPublica reported. Normally, in cases like Barnica’s doctors will offer medication to speed up labor or perform a procedure to empty the uterus. But Barnica’s fetus still had a heartbeat. And under the Texas ban, doctors could not intervene unless a “medical emergency” – a term that was not defined in the law – developed. About 40 hours after Barnica’s second arrival at the hospital, doctors stopped being able to detect a fetal heartbeat, according to the report. A doctor expedited her labor using medications and delivered Barnica’s fetus. But after she returned home, Barnica’s bleeding continued and worsened. Within days, she was back at the hospital, where she died of sepsis involving “products of conception”, according to her autopsy report. Her widowed husband is now raising their four-year-old daughter, ProPublica reported. Multiple experts, including OB-GYNs and maternal fetal medicine specialists, told ProPublica that delaying Barnica’s care ran against the medical standard of care due to the risk of infection. Had she been given options earlier, they told the outlet, Barnica might have survived. Doctors involved in Barnica’s case did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment. In a statement, HCA Healthcare, the hospital chain that treated Barnica, told ProPublica that doctors exercised independent judgment and “our responsibility is to be in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations”. Abortion and the consequences of banning the procedure have become one of the top issues in the US election, as support for abortion rights has surged in the years since Roe fell and dozens of women have come forward to say they were denied medically necessary care. Kamala Harris has made protecting abortion rights a key plank of her policy platform, while Donald Trump and other Republicans have tried to evade discussion of it or flip-flopped on the issue. “My heart breaks for the Barnica family,” Colin Allred, a US representative from Dallas running for a Senate seat, posted on X on Wednesday. Allred is running against Ted Cruz, the avowedly anti-abortion senator, and has made abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign. “Josseli Barnica should be alive today but because of Ted Cruz’s cruel abortion ban, Texas women have been denied the life-saving health care they need. We can’t afford six more years of Ted Cruz.” Cruz has recently kept quiet on abortion. He declined a ProPublica request from comment, as did the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and the state attorney general, Ken Paxton. In the weeks since ProPublica first reported on two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died after being unable to access legal abortions in their home state, Trump has also largely avoided commenting on their specific cases. However, during a Fox News townhall, the host Harris Faulkner told Trump that Thurman’s family was holding a press call. “We’ll get better ratings, I promise,” Trump joked. The crowd laughed.","2024-10-30T17:17:50Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/texas-woman-death-abortion-ban-miscarriage"
"abortion","Texas man drops lawsuit against women accused of helping ex-wife get abortion","A Texas man who sued his ex-wife’s friends for allegedly helping her get an abortion dropped his lawsuit on Thursday after the case was settled. Marcus Silva first sued Jackie Noyola and Amy Carpenter – both friends of his ex-wife – along with Aracely Garcia in 2023, alleging that the three had helped her obtain abortion pills in July 2022, about two months after she filed for divorce. Silva asked a Texas district court to award him more than $1m in damages for their “criminal and murderous actions”. Abortion bans typically target providers, not patients, and Texas, like the vast majority of states, does not criminalize self-managed abortion. (Silva’s ex-wife was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.) However, abortion rights advocates feared that, even if the first-of-its-kind lawsuit was not legally sound, it would still intimidate people out of helping one another get abortions. The case had been set to go to trial before Silva dropped the lawsuit. In court filings, Silva did not explain his reason for the decision, but a notice of settlement was submitted to the court. Carpenter told the Washington Post that no money had been exchanged as part of Silva’s abandonment of the lawsuit. Silva was represented in the lawsuit by Jonathan Mitchell, a lawyer who masterminded the Texas six-week abortion ban that deputized ordinary people to sue one another over suspected illegal abortions. “While we are grateful that this fraudulent case is finally over, we are angry for ourselves and others who have been terrorized for the simple act of supporting a friend who is facing abuse,” Noyola said in a statement. “No one should ever have to fear punishment, criminalization, or a lengthy court battle for helping someone they care about.” “This case was about using the legal system to harass us for helping our friend, and scare others out of doing the same,” Carpenter added. “After two years of being entangled in Mitchell and Silva’s campaign of abusive litigation, we were ready to fight this baseless suit in court. But the claims were dropped because they had nothing. We did nothing wrong, and we would do it all again.”","2024-10-11T17:22:40Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/11/texas-abortion-pills-lawsuit"
"abortion","Pregnant Texas teen died after three ER visits due to impact of abortion ban","A pregnant Texas teenager died after three separate visits to an emergency room in attempts to get care in another incident that has highlighted the medical impact of the loss of abortion rights in the US. Nevaeh Crain, 18, had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours in October 2023, each time returning home feeling worse than before. Crain was only diagnosed with strep throat upon her first visit. The hospital did not investigate her sharp abdominal cramps, according to reporting by ProPublica. Crain is one of at least two Texas women who died under the state’s abortion ban brought in after the US supreme court overturned the federal right to abortion. Josseli Barnica, 28, died after a miscarriage in 2021. These incidents are seen as evidence of a new reality in which US healthcare professionals in states with new tough abortion restrictions are hesitant or even afraid to give care to pregnant mothers over fear of legal repercussions. Texas’s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, regardless of whether the pregnancy is wanted or not. Medical records indicate Crain tested positive for sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition, on her second visit. But doctors still cleared her to leave after apparently confirming that her six-month-old fetus still had a heartbeat. On her third trip to the hospital, Crain was finally moved to intensive care after an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise”, reported ProPublica. She died hours later after suffering organ failure. A nurse noted that her lips had turned “blue and dusky”, ProPublica said. The teen would have turned 20 this Friday. Though Texas retains exceptions for life-threatening conditions, the fear and uncertainty instilled in doctors over which treatments may or may not be considered a crime has had devastating effects on women in need of healthcare. The result is that in states with abortion bans, patients are often traded between hospitals in order to shirk responsibility and argue about legalities, an act which wastes precious and potentially life-saving time. “Pregnant women have become essentially untouchables,” Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University, told ProPublica. The president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, Mini Timmaraju, said Crain’s death underscored the deadly threat posed by abortion bans. “Pregnancy should not be a death sentence,” Timmaraju said in a statement. Timmaraju placed the blame for abortion bans on the shoulders of Republican politicians such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the incumbent Texas senator who is facing a tough re-election fight against the Democrat Collin Allred. “This has to stop,” she said. “And our best chance to do that is to vote for reproductive freedom,” including by supporting Allred and Kamala Harris against Trump in the 5 November election. By doing so, “we can restore the right to abortion and these bans,” Timmaraju said.","2024-11-01T14:43:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/teen-dies-abortion-ban-texas-neveah-crain"
"abortion","Project 2025: what does the rightwing blueprint say about abortion?","Project 2025, the wishlist for a Trump 2.0 administration drawn up by the influential thinktank the Heritage Foundation, proposes mobilizing an array of government agencies to curb access to abortion – up to and including a national ban on abortion pills that would affect even states that protect abortion rights. Backed by more than 100 conservative organizations, the 922-page Project 2025 has become notorious in recent weeks as Kamala Harris has started bringing it up at rallies. Donald Trump has tried to distance himself from its many proposals, claiming he doesn’t know anything about Project 2025 and has “no idea who is behind it” – even though his administration’s officials wrote chunks of it. While the director of the blueprint stepped down last week, a move that the Trump campaign celebrated and that leaves its future operations unclear, the policy ideas endure and closely align with Trump’s platform. “The Dobbs decision [overturning Roe v Wade] is just the beginning,” Project 2025 reads. “Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including in the next conservative administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America.” Project 2025 takes direct aim at abortion pills, indicates that fetuses should have legal rights, and seeks to expand “surveillance” of abortion while eliminating government support for the procedure. In its architects’ view, abortion is not healthcare and should never be treated as such. “Project 2025’s whole-of-government approach to dismantling reproductive rights by weaponizing federal agencies and consolidating executive branch power is unprecedented – and goes against most Americans’ wishes,” said Caroline Ciccone, president of the watchdog group Accountable.US, which has been studying the plan. Here are some of the proposals that could rewrite abortion access in the US: Enforce the Comstock Act Project 2025’s most audacious proposal may be the easiest to enact: the playbook suggests that a future conservative administration enforce the Comstock Act, a 151-year-old anti-obscenity law that prohibits the mailing of abortion-related materials, to ban people from shipping abortion pills. Because abortion clinics rely on the mail to send and receive the pills, as do the advocates who help people induce their own abortions, enforcing the Comstock Act could result in a de facto national ban on medication abortion. After Roe fell, Biden’s Department of Justice issued guidance saying that the Comstock Act only applies to people who intentionally break the law. But a Trump administration could roll back that guidance and thus sidestep a gridlocked Congress to ban the most popular type of abortion. Reverse FDA’s approval of abortion pills This year, the US supreme court rejected a lawsuit from anti-abortion activists who wanted to reverse the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, a common abortion pill, ruling unanimously that the activists did not have the legal standing to sue. But a Project 2025 proposal suggests avoiding the courts altogether and, instead, having the FDA reverse its 2000 approval of mifepristone altogether. That reversal would yank the drug from the market. “Now that the supreme court has acknowledged that the constitution contains no right to an abortion, the FDA is ethically and legally obliged to revisit and withdraw its initial approval,” Roger Severino, who served as the head of Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) office of civil rights under Trump, wrote in Project 2025. Severino also suggests that, as an “interim step”, the FDA reverse guidance that allows providers to offer abortions via telemedicine – which currently accounts for 19% of all abortions nationwide. “The FDA isn’t a purely independent agency,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who studies the legal history of reproduction. “The secretary of HHS has a lot of ability to override both FDA rule-making and FDA approval decisions. Even if the FDA does not want to do anything, the secretary of HHS – who’s a political appointee – could or would, potentially.” Roll back privacy protections for abortion patients In June 2022, after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the Biden administration issued guidance asserting that, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), healthcare providers can talk to law enforcement about abortion patients only in “narrowly tailored” circumstances. For example, hospital workers are not allowed to tell cops that they suspect someone may have taken pills to induce an abortion. Cops also cannot demand records from an abortion clinic without a court order. Project 2025 demands that the Department of Health and Human Services withdraw that guidance. “HIPAA covers patients in the womb, but this guidance treats them as nonpersons contrary to law,” the playbook reads. “The guidance is unnecessary and contributes to ideologically motivated fearmongering about abortion after Dobbs.” It is legal in all but one state – Nevada – to “self-manage” your own abortion, but abortion rights advocates have long warned that, if a prosecutor wants to charge you for an abortion, they will find a statute elastic enough to do it. Between 2000 and 2020, 61 people were criminally investigated or arrested for allegedly self-managing their abortion or helping someone else do so. Project 2025’s language also suggests that fetuses deserve to be legally recognized as people. If this idea, known as “fetal personhood”, were ever fully enacted, it would not only completely ban abortion but rewrite vast swathes of US law. Increase CDC ‘surveillance’ over abortion The CDC already collects information about abortion from most of the country, in a report that the agency titles “abortion surveillance”. But its reports are incomplete, since states such as California do not supply the data. Project 2025 suggests that the CDC should go so far as to cut funds from a state if it does not tell the CDC “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”. Eliminate some immigrant girls’ access to abortion During the Trump administration, officials at the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) – which cares for minors who cross the border without parents or guardians – refused to let teen girls get abortions until a court ordered them to do so. In light of Roe’s demise, Project 2025 wants ORR to once again refuse to facilitate abortions. If that refusal leads to a lawsuit, the playbook wants a conservative administration to “fight to defend that policy up to the US supreme court”. Reshape the nation’s largest family planning program The Trump administration took a hammer to Title X, the nation’s only federal family planning program. Clinics that receive money through Title X are tasked with providing low-cost or free family planning services – such as birth control and STI screenings – to people regardless of age, immigration status or income. These clinics are already forbidden from using Title X dollars to pay for abortion services, but the Trump administration in 2018 barred Title X clinics from even counseling patients about the procedure. Rather than cave to what critics saw as a “gag rule”, more than 1,200 clinics left the Title X network. Between 2018 and 2020, the number of Title X patients dropped by 60%. The Biden administration rescinded Trump’s Title X provisions but Project 2025 suggests reviving the so-called gag rule, as well as reframing the 54-year-old program “around fertility awareness and holistic family planning”. Fertility awareness, a birth control method that involves tracking your cycle rather than using hormonal contraception, is typically only about 75% effective in preventing pregnancy. (Separately, the playbook also suggests removing Ella, a form of emergency contraception, from the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate.) Project 2025 wants to require Title X clinics to provide patients with information about “the importance of marriage to family and personal well-being”. Ultimately, the playbook says, the HHS should pursue a “family agenda”. It declares: “Married men and women are the ideal, natural family structure because all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them.”","2024-08-05T15:27:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/project-2025-abortion"
"abortion","Harris blames Trump for Georgia abortion-related death: ‘It’s what we feared’","Kamala Harris blamed Donald Trump’s policies and condemned state abortion bans on Tuesday after it was reported that a woman in Georgia died after being denied timely medical care due to the state’s restrictive abortion ban. Harris’s comments came on the heels of an investigation published by ProPublica on Monday, recounting the circumstances surrounding the 2022 death of Amber Nicole Thurman, a medical assistant from Georgia. The outlet called the case the first “preventable” abortion-related death to be confirmed, and said it would name a second in coming days. “These are the consequences of Donald Trump’s actions,” Harris said in a statement. Georgia’s six-week abortion ban went into effect shortly after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Thurman died after she developed a rare complication from abortion pills. Days after taking the pills, she was taken to an emergency room with heavy bleeding, as she had not yet expelled all of the fetal tissue from her body. Doctors waffled on her treatment, according to the report, waiting 20 hours to perform a routine procedure. Thurman, who was 28 years old and the mother of a six-year-old boy, died in emergency surgery. “This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,” said Harris, who has made abortion rights a prominent feature of her presidential campaign. “This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.” In Georgia, performing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy is a felony. While the law allows for exceptions to save a pregnant person’s life, doctors say its wording is too vague to be workable in practice. Since 2022, more than 20 states have enacted abortion bans and restrictions. After Thurman’s death, a state medical review committee deemed that her death was “preventable”, and that there was a “good chance” she would have survived if she had received the procedure earlier, according to ProPublica. ProPublica reported that Thurman became pregnant shortly after Georgia’s six-week abortion ban took effect and that her pregnancy had just passed that mark. Thurman scheduled a procedure known as dilation and curettage, or D&amp;C, in North Carolina for 13 August and journeyed there with her best friend, ProPublica reported, after finding a babysitter and scheduling a day off work. However, they encountered heavy traffic on the drive, her best friend told ProPublica, and the clinic could not hold Thurman’s spot longer than 15 minutes. As a result, Thurman was given a two-pill medication abortion regimen approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which included mifepristone and misoprostol, as her pregnancy was well within the standard of care for that treatment. Abortion using medication is the most common way to end a pregnancy in the US, and deaths from complications are extremely rare. ProPublica reported that at the clinic in North Carolina, Thurman received instructions on how to safely take the pills and was told to go to the emergency room if complications developed. She took the first pill at the clinic and drove home before any symptoms started and took the second pill the next day, as directed. Initially, she only experienced cramping, but her condition worsened over several days with vomiting and heavy bleeding. If she had lived near the North Carolina clinic, she would have received a D&amp;C for free as soon as she followed up, the executive director there told ProPublica. But Thurman was about four hours away. Thurman passed out and was taken to a hospital in suburban Atlanta with a severe infection. Thurman needed a D&amp;C, but the operation was delayed for around 20 hours as her blood pressure sank and her organs started to fail, according to ProPublica. The report states that she was diagnosed with “acute severe sepsis” the following morning. However, even then, a D&amp;C was not performed. Around 20 hours after she arrived at the hospital, the doctor conducted the D&amp;C and discovered that a hysterectomy was also necessary. Thurman’s heart stopped during the procedure. The maternal mortality review committee in Georgia determined that there was a “good chance” that Thurman’s death could likely have been prevented if the D&amp;C had been provided earlier. Before her death, Thurman had been planning to enroll in nursing school, her friend told ProPublica. She and her child had recently moved out of her family’s place and into their own apartment. Thurman’s last words to her mother before she died were: “Promise me you’ll take care of my son,” the outlet reported. Studies have shown that the availability of the D&amp;C procedure for abortions and miscarriage care in the year after Roe v Wade was passed in 1973 reduced the rate of maternal deaths for women of color by up to 40%. But since more than 20 states enacted abortion bans or restrictions in the last two years, women in with medical complications have been repeatedly turned away from emergency rooms. “Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again,” Harris statement said. “Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying.” As president, Trump appointed three conservative supreme court justices who were decisive in overturning Roe. And as a candidate, he has alternately bragged about his role in overturning Roe v Wade, and also complained that Republican extremism on the issue could cost them the election. “If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban, and these horrific realities will multiply,” Harris said. “We must pass a law to restore reproductive freedom. When I am president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. Lives depend on it.” Mini Timmaraju, the president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a press call on Monday that Thurman’s death “substantiated proof of something we already knew – that abortion bans kill people and it cannot go on”. Regina Davis Moss, the CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda, said in a statement that what happened to Thurman was “entirely preventable” adding that this is the “post-Dobbs reality for many Black women, girls, gender expansive people”. Moss also noted a study that estimated that if abortions ban were in every state, there could be a “staggering” 39% increase in maternal deaths for Black women.

"abortion","Texas midwife arrested for allegedly providing abortions amid state’s near-total ban","A Texas midwife has been arrested over accusations that she performed abortions in defiance of the state’s near-total abortion ban, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced on Monday. Maria Margarita Rojas has been charged with the illegal performance of an abortion and with practicing medicine without a license, according to a press release from Paxton’s office. Under Texas law, the illegal performance of an abortion is considered a second-degree felony. If convicted, Rojas could face decades in prison. Rojas’s arrest is believed to be the first criminal arrest under Texas’s abortion ban. Last year, Paxton’s office sued Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based abortion provider, for allegedly mailing abortion pills to a Texan. “In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state’s pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,” Paxton said in a statement accompanying the news of Rojas’s arrest. “Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable.” In the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, enabling Texas and more than a dozen other states to ban almost all abortions, anti-abortion activists have grown increasingly fed up with the lack of prosecutions of abortion providers. In Texas, advocates have increasingly encouraged men whose partners have had abortions to strike back with legal action. Rojas, 48, operated a network of three clinics in the Houston area, according to Paxton’s office. These clinics, his office said, “unlawfully employed unlicensed individuals who falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals to provide medical treatment”. Requests for comment from Rojas’s clinics were not immediately returned. However, Holly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birthing center where Rojas sometimes worked, told the Texas Tribune that she did not believe the allegations. “I’ve known her for eight years and I’ve never heard her talk about anything like that,” said Shearman, who said Rojas is a devout Catholic who often works with Spanish-speaking, low-income individuals. “I just can’t picture Maria being involved in something like this.” Midwives – in particular, midwives of color – have long been a target of US anti-abortion activism. As abortion bans spread across the country in the 19th century, midwives were often driven out of work or faced criminal consequences, which in turn led white, male doctors to siphon up their patients and dominate the medical field.","2025-03-17T22:14:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/texas-midwife-abortion-state-ban"
"abortion","Samuel Alito and German rightwing aristocrat linked to US anti-abortion activist","The supreme court justice Samuel Alito and a German aristocrat and “networker of the far right” from whom Alito accepted expensive concert tickets, are both linked to an ultra-conservative Catholic US group whose board members include the dark money impresario Leonard Leo and the founder of a hardline anti-abortion Christian group, documentation reviewed by the Guardian shows. In 2018, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, told the New York Times about attending a dinner hosted in Rome by James Harvey, an American cardinal and hardliner, and sponsored by the Napa Institute, a group founded by Timothy R Busch, a conservative Catholic businessman and political activist. Leo, 59, is an activist and fundraiser who worked on the confirmations of all six rightwing justices who now dominate the supreme court, Alito among them. Now controlling billions of dollars in funding for rightwing groups, Leo is a director of the Napa Institute Legal Foundation, also known as Napa Legal Institute, and the Napa Institute Support Foundation. Also among Napa Legal Institute directors is Alan Sears, founder of the Alliance Defending Freedom. The ADF was the principal driver of Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case in which the supreme court ended the federal right to abortion, with Alito writing the ruling handed down in June 2022. In 2017, the Napa Institute hosted a two-day symposium at the Trump hotel in Washington, during which Alito attended a dinner. Writing for the Washington Post, John Gehring, an author and reporter, said the symposium “mixed traditional Catholic religious practices with moments that felt uncomfortably nationalistic”, including a “reading in the rosary booklet from [the Confederate general] Robert E Lee that [seemed] … stunningly insensitive at best … at a time when the ‘alt-right’ and white nationalism are basking in the glow of renewed attention and proximity to power”. Alito is not the only supreme court justice with links to the Napa Institute. In September 2021, as part of a series sponsored by the group, Justice Clarence Thomas spoke at the University of Notre Dame. “The court was thought to be the least dangerous branch and we may have become the most dangerous,” Thomas said, attacking judges he deemed to be “venturing into areas we should not have entered into” – meaning politics. Thomas and Alito, however, have been the subject of numerous reports about undeclared gifts from rightwing donors, fueling an ethics crisis now stoked by news of Alito’s acceptance of concert tickets valued at $900 from von Thurn und Taxis. Von Thurn und Taxis, 64, is a former punk turned billionaire, also known as Princess TNT, with close links to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. News of her gift to Alito was accompanied by reporting of further links between the two, including a picture of Alito and another rightwing justice, Brett Kavanaugh, posing at the supreme court in 2019 with the German socialite; Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German hardliner; and Brian Brown, a prominent US anti-LGBTQ+ campaigner. Von Thurn und Taxis told German media that Alito and his wife, Martha-Ann, attended a concert at her castle in Bavaria last year as “private friends”. In emails to the Guardian, the aristocrat clarified: “We never speak about politics nor religion at the table, because we believe it limits the possibility to make friends.” The socialite, who rejects the label “networker of the far right”, also said it would “never occur” to her to speak about “touchy subjects” like abortion with someone she knew socially, and claimed not to know that “the Dobbs decision” referred to the supreme court abortion rights ruling written by Alito. In a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Brussels last April, von Thurn und Taxis said European leaders were “financ[ing] the killing of our offspring” in an apparent reference to the availability of reproductive rights in Europe. She added: “Does this make any sense? Is there some kind of racism? Are we not supposed to reproduce?” Alito and his wife have also been outspoken about abortion and other hot-button cultural issues. In June, the progressive activist Lauren Windsor released recordings in which Justice Alito agreed that the US should “return … to a place of godliness” and said, “I don’t know that we can negotiate with the left”. Regarding her supposed persecution from those on the left, his wife said: “Look at me, look at me. I’m German. I’m from Germany. My heritage is German. You come after me, I’m gonna give it back to you.” Caroline Ciccone, president of Accountable.US, which campaigns for court reform and which highlighted links between the German socialite, the Napa Institute and Alito, said: “When a supreme court justice like Samuel Alito pals around with influential rightwing figures like Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis and Leonard Leo, it raises concerns about fairness and impartiality. “These relationships aren’t just about gifts. They reflect a deeper effort to manipulate our legal system in ways that could impact the rights of everyday people.” Ciccone added, “What’s disturbing is that this happens behind closed doors – at parties at the Bavarian castle – away from public scrutiny. We’re talking about relationships that can affect everything, from reproductive rights to environmental protections” – both the subject of recent supreme court rulings widely seen as victories for the political right. “The American people deserve a judiciary that serves justice impartially,” Ciccone said, “not one that can be bought.”","2024-09-17T10:00:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/samuel-alito-leonard-leo-gloria-von-thurn-und-taxis-napa-institute"
"abortion","London play paused after theatregoers felt faint during abortion scene","An award-winning play premiering in London had to be stopped for 10 minutes during a preview performance on Monday after several mainly male audience members called for medical assistance after a graphic abortion scene. The Years, directed by Eline Arbo, is about one woman’s personal and political story, set against the backdrop of a rapidly changing postwar Europe – from advances in reproductive rights to setbacks such as sexism in the workplace. Based on the autobiography Les Années by the French Nobel prizewinner Annie Ernaux, five actors, including Romola Garai (The Hour and Atonement) and Gina McKee (Our Friends in the North) take on the role of the protagonist at different ages. The two-hour drama, which opened in Amsterdam in 2022 before its UK premiere at the Almeida theatre on Thursday, features a graphic backstreet abortion scene about halfway through. During the scene, a man in the front of the stalls indicated that he was feeling faint while those nearby gestured for staff to help. The man was taken outside to the bar area, where he was joined by a handful of other audience members who also said they felt faint. During the pause, another audience member is reported to have shouted from the circle that the scene “was a disgrace” and “there was no warning”. In a rare move, he was responded to from the stage by being told there had been “warnings about the abortion” in the theatre’s guidance. On the Almeida’s website, in the programme for the play and in emails sent to ticket holders, guidance warns that “The Years contains sexual content, a graphic depiction of abortion, a coerced sexual encounter and blood”. In a statement, the theatre said: “The performance on Monday of The Years was stopped for 10 minutes so that our front of house team could provide care for an audience member who required assistance. During the stoppage, care was also provided for three other audience members. All audience members were quick to recover after brief assistance.” The statement added that warnings were in place on “the Almeida website – here, on the booking page, in pre-visit emails, and on front of house signage in the theatre”. The play was a hit with critics in Amsterdam, with one newspaper calling it “a dazzling history of a time and of a life”. In an inerview with the Observer this month, the actors discussed what Ernaux’s work meant to them and where they thought the feminist project stood today. “I don’t think it’s in a good place at the moment,” Garai said. “Once you’ve achieved goals on paper – you can have an abortion, you can vote, you are recognised in law as not being property of your husband – you lose a lot of the language … How do we now talk about the kind of subtle ways in which women are disenfranchised?” The Years is not the first play to have left audience members feeling woozy. In 2016, five people fainted watching graphic scenes of torture, rape and violence in the National Theatre’s Cleansed, while 40 walked out in the show’s first week. Audience members also walked out of A Little Life in the West End, which featured portrayals of suicide, self-harm and child abuse. One audience member called the adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s novel, starring James Norton, “possibly the most upsetting, unflinchingly brutal and explicit play I’ve ever seen”. During a show at Edinburgh festival last year, the performer Eloina Haines had to stop her act to check in on an audience member after they nearly fainted. • This article was amended on 13 August 2024 to clarify a detail regarding the incident at the Almeida theatre.","2024-07-31T12:09:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/31/london-play-the-years-paused-after-theatregoers-felt-faint-during-abortion-scene"
"abortion","Competing abortion measures can appear on November’s ballot, Nebraska supreme court says","Nebraska residents will vote this November on two competing ballot measures to expand or limit abortion rights, the state supreme court ruled on Friday. One of the measures that will be put to voters would enshrine Nebraska’s current abortion ban, which outlaws the procedure past 12 weeks of pregnancy, into the state constitution. The other would amend the state constitution to add the right to abortion up until fetal viability, or at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier this week, the Nevada supreme court heard arguments in lawsuits that tried to kick one or both of the measures off the ballot. Abortion rights supporters and opponents had tussled in court over whether the measures violated state law that requires ballot measures to address only a single subject, but the supreme court rejected that argument on Friday and found that neither measure broke the law. Nebraska legislators passed the 12-week abortion ban in 2023, after failing to pass a bill that would have banned abortion past about six weeks of pregnancy. Without the viability standard, anti-abortion lawmakers could try to get an even stricter ban through the legislature, abortion rights advocates warned. “Patients with pregnancy complications after 12 weeks are being delayed and restricted care, or must leave the state to get the help they need – putting their lives, fertility, and physical and mental health at risk,” Protect Our Rights, the organization behind the abortion rights ballot measure, said in a statement. The Nebraska ruling, which had to be issued by Friday in order to finalize the ballot, tees up an unusually direct showdown in the nationwide fight over abortion rights. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, more than a dozen states have banned almost all abortions. In response, abortion rights supporters have started adding pro-abortion rights measures to state ballots. So far, they have an unbroken winning streak. States such as Michigan and Ohio have passed ballot measures enshrining the right to abortion in their state constitutions, while voters in states such as Kansas and Kentucky have rejected measures that could curtail the right to the procedure. However, no state has overturned a post-Roe abortion ban through a ballot measure, and no state has put such dueling measures in front of voters at the same time. Voters in 10 states, including Nebraska, will have abortion-related measures on their ballots this year. Democrats are hoping that the measures will drive turnout in key battleground states such as Arizona and Nevada, and Kamala Harris has made support for abortion a key plank in her policy platform.","2024-09-13T16:07:39Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/13/nebraska-supreme-court-abortion-ballot-measures"

Jacinta Allan is warning that the battle for abortion rights must continue as conservative forces pose “real and genuine threats to the protections women have fought for and won” amid “frightening” debate in South Australia and Queensland. Speaking of Queensland, can Steven Miles pull off an upset this weekend? Plus: Tucker Carlson makes a barely believable speech at a Trump rally. Australia Screen spray | A descendant of the artist Frederick McCubbin has backed the Western Australian Museum’s decision to buy the perspex screen used to protect one of his most famous paintings but on to which activists spray-painted the Woodside logo. Queensland election | Queensland premier Steven Miles has gone from underdog to attack dog (more on that below), putting David Crisafulli on the back foot. If the LNP frontrunner wins in Queensland at the weekend’s election, the party’s cabinet ministers will be assigned targets – and face consequences if they fail to meet the grade. But experts warn that setting KPIs could create perverse incentives. WiseTech | Richard White, the embattled founder, chief executive and major shareholder of Australian tech giant WiseTech, has stood down from the company “with immediate effect” after weeks of damaging revelations about his personal life hammering the company’s reputation and share price. Scratchy summer | Dog owners have been warned about a tick boom unfolding along the east coast, with some experts predicting an unusually bad season for pets. World Carlson rant | Tucker Carlson warmed up the crowd at a Donald Trump rally with a barely believable, borderline creepy speech likening how the Republican presidential candidate could mete out punishment to Kamala Harris like an angry father spanking his daughter. Trump said he would fire Jack Smith, the justice department special counsel prosecuting him for allegedly plotting to overturn the 2020 election, “in two seconds”. On the Democrat side, reports say Beyoncé might appear with Harris in Houston to highlight abortion rights. ‘Sowing barbarism’ | World leaders pledged US$1bn in aid for Lebanon at a conference in Paris hosted by Emmanuel Macron who warned the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about “sowing barbarism”. At least 17 people including several children were earlier killed in Israeli bombing of a school turned shelter in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, medics in the territory said. Climate ‘crunch’ | The huge cuts in carbon emissions now needed to end the climate crisis mean it is “crunch time for real”, according to the UN’s environment chief. In better news, the US power grid has added 20GW of battery capacity in the past four years. Letby rejection | Lucy Letby, the British former nurse serving 12 life sentences for murdering babies in her care, has been refused permission to appeal against a conviction for attempting to murder a baby girl. Trudeau pledge | Justin Trudeau has insisted that he will lead his Liberal party into the next election, dismissing a request by some party members to not run for a fourth term. Full Story Newsroom edition: the abortion culture war and its consequences Bridie Jabour talks to the editor-in-chief, Lenore Taylor, and the national news editor, Josephine Tovey, about the consequences of abortion turning into a culture war. In-depth Those who know Queensland’s premier, Steven Miles, well say he can at times appear brow-beaten and exhausted by the daily grind of politics. He has admitted sometimes being “drained” by the constant spotlight and envious of colleagues who draw energy from it. But on the campaign trail, Miles has come alive, writes Ben Smee. Not the news The Australian punk band Amyl and the Sniffers are about to begin a major British tour that suggests they are on the brink of transforming critical acclaim and cult status into something much bigger.

"abortion","Women in West Virginia who miscarry could face criminal charges, prosecutor says","Women in West Virginia could face criminal charges if they miscarry, a county prosecutor told a local news outlet last week, urging women who miscarry to contact law enforcement. “The kind of criminal jeopardy you face is going to depend on a lot of factors,” the Raleigh county prosecuting attorney Tom Truman told the outlet WVNS 59News in comments reported on Friday. “What was your intent? What did you do? How late were you in your pregnancy? Were you trying to hide something, were you just so emotionally distraught you couldn’t do anything else?” He added: “If you were relieved, and you had been telling people, ‘I’d rather get ran over by a bus than have this baby,’ that may play into law enforcement’s thinking, too.” Truman said he was personally opposed to prosecuting women who miscarry, but other law enforcement officials in West Virginia had said they would be willing to do so under laws that dictate the disposal of human remains. Although West Virginia bans virtually all abortions, its ban – like other abortion bans in the US – does not penalize abortion patients but instead people who provide the procedure. To protect themselves, Truman suggested that women call law enforcement after they have a miscarriage. “Call your doctor. Call law enforcement, or 911, and just say, ‘I miscarried. I want you to know,’” Truman said. The wave of state-level abortion bans that followed the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade sparked fears among women and abortion supporters that people who miscarry could face charges over their handling of fetal remains. As abortions and miscarriages – which are known in medical parlance as “spontaneous abortions” – can look deeply similar to medical professionals, abortion bans can incentivize police to treat pregnancy losses like crime scenes. In 2023, a woman in Ohio was charged with felony abuse of a corpse after she miscarried into a toilet. A grand jury ultimately decided not to indict. Earlier this year, after a Georgia woman suffered a miscarriage and was found bleeding in a parking lot, police charged her with concealing the death of another person and throwing away or abandoning a dead body. Those charges were dropped. “There is no one-size-fits-all way to handle fetal remains in these situations – in fact, doctors often tell women to simply miscarry at home,” Dana Sussman, senior vice-president of the reproductive-rights organization Pregnancy Justice, said in a statement issued after news of the Georgia case broke. “No one is taught how to handle fetal remains, and police and prosecutors should not be weighing in on how women in this situation respond.”","2025-06-05T18:21:55Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/west-virginia-miscarriage-crime-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Harris targets Trump for falsehoods on abortion and immigration in fiery debate","Kamala Harris and Donald Trump sparred on Tuesday in a contentious presidential debate that repeatedly went off the rails, as the former president pursued bizarre and often falsehood-ridden tangents about crowd sizes, immigration policy and abortion access. The Philadelphia debate marked arguably the most significant opportunity for both Harris and Trump since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race in July, and the event began cordially enough. Harris crossed over to Trump’s podium to shake his hand and introduce herself, an acknowledgement that the two presidential nominees had never met face to face before Tuesday night. But the cordiality did not last long. After delivering some boilerplate attack lines about the high inflation seen earlier in Biden’s presidency, Trump pivoted to mocking Harris as a “Marxist” and peddling baseless claims that Democrats want to “execute the baby” by allowing abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy. That false claim was corrected by both Harris and the ABC News anchor Linsey Davis, who joined her fellow moderator David Muir in fact-checking some of Trump’s statements throughout the evening. Harris then segued into a stinging rebuke of Trump’s record on abortion, criticizing him for nominating three of the supreme court justices who ruled to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022. “One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said. “And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v Wade, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it in to law.” Despite broad public support for Roe v Wade, Trump boasted about his role in reversing it and applauded the supreme court’s “great courage” in issuing its ruling, while he dodged repeated questions about whether he would veto a national abortion ban as president. Trump seemed to trip over himself even when moderators offered questions on his strongest issues, such as immigration. When asked about Biden’s handling of the US-Mexico border, Harris pivoted to discussing Trump’s campaign rallies. “I’m going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump’s rallies because it’s a really interesting thing to watch,” Harris said. “You will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about [how] windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you.” The tangent appeared to be a blatant attempt by Harris to bait Trump into squabbling over attendance at his rallies instead of discussing immigration policy – and it worked. Trump began attacking Harris with baseless accusations that her campaign was paying people to attend her rallies while celebrating his own events as “the most incredible rallies in the history of politics”. Then, rather than highlighting his immigration proposals, Trump chose to spread debunked claims that Haitian migrants in an Ohio city have started capturing and eating their neighbors’ pets. “They’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.” The outburst instantly became a source of mockery on social media, as Democrats celebrated Trump for “doubling down on the crazy uncle vibe”, in the words of the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. Even as moments of the debate bordered on absurdity, other exchanges regarding foreign policy and the January 6 insurrection felt heavy with meaning. Pressed on his false claims regarding widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election, Trump again refused to acknowledge his defeat, prompting a stark warning from Harris. “Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so, let’s be clear about that. And, clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that,” Harris said. “But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts, as he did in the past, to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election.” On foreign policy, Harris fielded difficult questions on the war in Gaza, as she expressed her support for Israel’s “right to defend itself” while calling for “security, self determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve” for Palestinians. Asked about his own stance on the war, Trump reiterated his bombastic claims that his presence in the White House would have prevented the wars in both Gaza and Ukraine. “If I were president, it would have never started,” Trump said. “If I were president, Russia would have never, ever. I know Putin very well. He would have never – and there was no threat of it either, by the way, for four years – have gone into Ukraine.” And yet, when asked directly whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia, Trump deflected. “I want the war to stop,” Trump said. “I think it’s the US’s best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, all right? Negotiate a deal because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.” The debate ended with Harris vowing to be “a president for all Americans” while Trump attacked her as “the worst vice-president in the history of our country”. It was a fitting end for two candidates who offered starkly different visions for the nation in what might be their only presidential debate. No other presidential debate has yet been officially scheduled, so the face-off on Tuesday may represent the last time that Harris and Trump meet before election day. The days ahead will determine whether the debate made a lasting impression on the undecided voters who will decide what appears to be a neck-and-neck race.

"abortion","Queensland election abortion debate: it’s what David Crisafulli is not saying that matters most","Pollsters say one word – “abortion” – has entered the minds of Queensland voters as Saturday’s state election draws near. “It is coming up unprompted in our surveys, people are bringing it up as an issue” one political strategist told Guardian Australia last week. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has repeatedly refused to give a direct answer to questions about his personal position on abortion rights, and whether he would allow his party a conscience vote. At Tuesday’s final debate with the premier, Steven Miles, Crisafulli finally deviated from his rehearsed line. He said attacks by Labor were “desperation”. “Women deserve better than the scare campaign that has been run. There will be no change at all. The scare campaign should not cut a single mention in your mind. “Those laws will not change”. Asked by Miles whether he was pro-choice, he said: “Yes.” It is unlikely this will end the issue. As Guardian Australian revealed on Tuesday afternoon, Crisafulli told a live audience last year that “I do not believe in late-term abortions” and that he would allow LNP MPs a conscience vote on the issue. This is Crisafulli’s key problem. He cannot rule it out if he cannot rule out a conscience vote. This week some media reports claimed that crossbencher Robbie Katter had backtracked on his vow to introduce a private member’s bill that would in turn trigger a conscience vote to wind back abortion access and rights. A spokesperson for Katter said he made no such backtrack. Katter spoke about his intention to revive a “babies born alive” bill that would mandate life-saving interventions on the extremely rare occasions where an unviable foetus is born alive. Healthcare professionals say claims by anti-choice lobby groups about the situation amount to misinformation. Reports claiming Katter has backtracked appear to misunderstand that re-introducing this bill proposes to amend the Termination of Pregnancy Act. It is – by definition – a wind back of abortion laws. Regardless, the prospect of a conscience vote has put significant focus on the personal views of LNP MPs and candidates. Many have previously been on record opposing abortion rights; none has been willing to answer questions about those views during the campaign. One LNP candidate – a former MP who once claimed abortions increased a woman’s risk of breast cancer – told voters that she was “pro-life” but that she couldn’t “say anything yet because we have got to get elected”. Crisafulli’s previously unreported remarks at a Griffith University event on 31 May 2023 – that he did not “believe in” late-term abortion, that Labor’s laws went “too far” but that he would not support re-criminalisation – are likely to add further pressure. When Crisafulli took charge, the LNP was riddled with factional infighting – most notably involving members of the rightwing “Christian soldiers” faction but also grassroots unrest at the organisational leadership. The party was directionless and almost locked out of inner-Brisbane, where voters have been put off by the party’s conservative social policies at state level. Crisafulli was asked at the Griffith event about why “fierce ideological battles” had become apparent on the conservative side of politics. “I’ll answer that with two words: not here,” Crisafulli said. “Even my harshest of critics will acknowledge the unity and discipline of the Queensland LNP is at a level it’s never been before and it hasn’t happened by chance.” That unity and discipline has brought the LNP to the brink of an election victory but the divisions within the party remain. Earlier this year, the Christian right won control of a branch covering the state’s most progressive federal electorate – Griffith, held by the Greens. Its new president is Alan Baker, a veteran anti-abortion campaigner. The other key problem for Crisafulli is that the LNP can not point back to any sort of record of success running a more modern Queensland. The last long-term conservative government in the state was from the Bjelke-Petersen era. Since the merger of the Liberal and National parties, conservatives have only won one election – a landslide victory in 2012 that brought Campbell Newman to power with the country’s largest ever majority, and ended after only a term. During that time Newman – elected after campaigning as a moderate – inherited a party of candidates who had not been expected to win, and a caucus where the Christian right had significant influence. It scrapped same-sex civil unions and was embarrassingly swept from power. Labor is exploiting the issue because it knows it puts the LNP’s candidates and grassroots membership at odds with the general public. But ironically, it could be the Greens who suffer most from the focus on abortion. Sources say abortion will likely have the biggest impact in middle-class electorates, where most voters are university educated. These are, in many cases, seats where Labor is under pressure from the Greens, rather than the LNP. Greens MPs would vote in a bloc to support abortion rights – they wouldn’t have a conscience vote like the major parties – but the threat to them remains that traditional Labor voters in these seats might stick with the party if it puts progressive social issues front and centre. Outside Brisbane, the issue could cut through in another way. On Tuesday, Miles compared Crisafulli to the Townsville mayor, Troy Thompson, who was elected in a protest vote and quickly came under pressure to resign amid an investigation into his claims about his military service. “It underlines what can happen when you elect someone who is unknown. The people of Townsville didn’t really know what they were getting with Troy Thompson and that’s worked out really badly. And that could happen with David Crisafulli. He’s hiding his views on so many important issues”. There is a contradiction between Crisafulli’s comments on Tuesday, that he is pro-choice, and his statement in 2023 that he did not believe in late-term abortions. There is a contradiction between his steadfast defence of the right to a conscience vote a year ago and his continued refusal to make a clear statement about it these past few weeks. While those contradictions remain, so will doubts remain in the minds of many voters.","2024-10-23T00:16:13Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/23/qld-election-2024-abortion-debate-lnp-david-crisafulli-queensland"
"abortion","We’ll need to fight to protect US reproductive rights. Here’s what to expect","At around 10pm ET on election night, with prediction needles listing rightwards, and various friends’ group chats starting to become inundated by the river-of-tears-down-my-face emoji – even that early, we were collectively way beyond a single tear – I left Steve Kornacki frantically bobbing and weaving around a map of Georgia, and went to bed. Somehow, I slept through until the morning, when I awoke in “Trump’s America”, as news organizations were calling it, and to a torrent of emails and notes from friends bemoaning, among other things, the very real possibility of a federal abortion ban. “Are we still gonna have birth control?” one friend texted, in disbelief. “Sorry for the US you’re waking up to,” another wrote from Oxford. “Confounding,” his wife echoed, from across the pond. And so, to get a clear-eyed, postmortem picture of what might be facing women and their loved ones in America, two days after the election I called up Nancy Northup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group with a stated mission of “using the power of law to advance reproductive rights as fundamental human rights around the world”. In practice, that means unleashing an army of seasoned litigators to fight for abortion access, among other things, in courtrooms across the country and around the world – they currently work in five continents. She began as CEO in 2003, 30 years after Roe v Wade constitutionally protected abortion rights. Twenty years later, after fighting the good fight for decades, she and her litigators are revving up for what might be the fight of their careers. “We were always accused before Roe v Wade was overturned [of] crying wolf,” Northup told me on the phone from her office in Manhattan. “People don’t need to worry about whether or not we’re crying wolf now.” There are the women who have died when denied abortions by healthcare providers who are unsure of the legal ramifications of performing abortions unless the mother’s life is at risk. There are those who have spent days in the ICU after being denied care, and emerge with their future fertility forever compromised. There are the obstetricians fleeing states with strict abortion bans (over 20% of practitioners in Idaho, and over half of high-risk obstetricians), feeling that they are unable to safely, and properly, do the job they trained years to do. There are the downstream consequences of bans in restrictive states affecting states with robust abortion protections, simply because those who can travel to receive care end up taking appointments away from local residents. The question that kept circulating among my friends in the hours after the election results became clear was: How come seven out of 10 measures to protect reproductive rights passed at the state level, and Trump still won? Northup chalks the dissonance up to two things. “There’s a difference between what policy do I want, and what candidate do I like,” she said. “Of course they should be linked, but we can see that they aren’t.” On top of that, Northup fears there are too many mental leaps to make. “Most people think, You know what, if the right to abortion is protected in my state, I’m good. They don’t realize a federal abortion ban could override their state’s rights.” While she wrote in a statement after the results came in that Trump’s first term “lead to the deaths of numerous women who are likely the tip of the iceberg”, she said it was too early to paint a picture of just how large that iceberg might loom in his second. Still, she underscored that even if a bill isn’t signed into law – something she pointed out Trump has said he wouldn’t do, though “consistency isn’t the hallmark of the president-elect” – there are ways to threaten abortion access at a national level. Northup and other colleagues at the Center held an open video meeting a few hours before we spoke, the tone of which was sober, with lots of “no way to sugarcoat what we’re facing right nows”s, and “serious situation”s and “tough road ahead”s. Among her top concerns are, first, the fear that new laws will threaten patients’ access to medication abortion – something she calls “a lifeline”, as two-thirds of patients in the US use it – either by the FDA restricting mifepristone, or states using a 1873 chastity law known as the Comstock Act, which bans “any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion” from being transported by a mail carrier; and, second, the targeting of populations in states with bans. She recently found herself on the phone with a woman whose family was leaving Texas to get an abortion in New York, and wasn’t sure if her husband should come with her or not. “That’s a culture, or a climate, of fear of prosecution, and intimidation, and silencing,” she said. “It has a chilling effect.” And it’s a chilling effect that the minority of American voters want to cast over the country. One exit poll noted that while voters in 10 “key states” believe by a wide margin that abortion should be legal, only 14% considered it their most important voting issue. I reached out to a friend who works in the reproductive rights space for help parsing through this disconnect. “The lack of urgency that voters placed on this issue may reflect an erroneous belief that state protections can save them; misplaced faith in Trump’s softened messaging on abortion; or simply a reality that many are struggling to make ends meet and feel abortion is an issue they can’t afford to think about today,” she wrote. “Who knows.” Whatever the reason, it means the litigators at CRR have their work cut out for them, as they fight for what the majority of Americans want. Right now, Northup is revving up for a case that will start on Tuesday in Idaho, arguing that the state, by refusing to give stabilizing care to pregnant women in emergencies, is violating the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (Emtala), a federal law that ensures access to emergency care. And she is gaining strength from success stories, like Missouri, which overturned its near-total abortion ban on Tuesday, despite electing Trump, something she called “stunning”. (She remembers having a conversation with a senator in Missouri years ago, and bringing up the question of just how to talk about abortion rights in the state. The senator’s advice: “Don’t.”) How does she feel? “Armored up and ready to go.” For those of us who might not feel that way, there are other ways to help. On the video call, one colleague offered three action items: First, take care of yourselves and your communities. Second: sign up for alerts from the Center. Finally, find and donate to a local abortion access fund. Godspeed.

"abortion","JD Vance to spend summer family holiday in the Cotswolds","He made his name with a memoir set among the hillbillies of the rugged Appalachians – yet it seems JD Vance now favours altogether more gentle hills. For his family’s holiday this year the US vice-president is understood to have chosen the Cotswolds, where Land Rovers outnumber pickup trucks. Vance, his wife, Usha, and their three young children are expected next month to rent a property in the region – an increasingly popular choice for wealthy tourists – soon after Donald Trump, the US president, finishes a stay in Scotland. Earlier in August, Vance and his family are expected to visit London, despite the vice-president having previously expressed reservations about the city, which he said – shortly before last year’s presidential election – was “not English any more.” In February, Vance lashed out at European governments – including that of the UK – accusing political leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters. “In Britain and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat,” he told the Munich Security Conference, listing a string of cases he claimed were evidence. Britain was singled out for arresting a man praying near an abortion clinic. But while Vance might enjoy the Cotswolds – home to the Chipping Norton set whose ranks include David Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson – a different reception could await when he later travels on to Scotland, which is home to anti-Trump sentiment. In his Munich speech, Vance hit out at the Scottish government over abortion rights, saying it was distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones”, warning them that “even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. He added: “The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe.” A spokesperson for the Scottish government said Vance’s claim was inaccurate. It appeared to be a reference to the introduction of safe access zones within 200 metres of abortion clinics, banning any form of harassment. “Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was,” added the spokesperson. Vance’s trip to the UK comes at a time when tourist traffic going in the opposite direction has plummeted against the backdrop of Trump’s policies and rhetoric. The number of UK residents visiting the US was down 14.3% in March compared with the same month in 2024, official figures showed. However, Britons continue to make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US.","2025-07-20T15:21:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/20/jd-vance-to-spend-summer-family-holiday-in-the-cotswolds"
"abortion","Judge slaps down Florida effort to ban abortion ad: ‘It’s the first amendment, stupid’","Florida’s health department can’t block a TV advertisement in support of a ballot measure that would protect abortion rights, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, after the department sent letters to local TV stations commanding them to stop airing the ad or risk criminal consequences. “The government cannot excuse its indirect censorship of political speech simply by declaring the disfavored speech is ‘false’,” US district judge Mark E Walker wrote in his ruling. “To keep it simple for the State of Florida: it’s the First Amendment, stupid.” Florida is one of 10 states set to vote on abortion-related ballot measures in November. If enacted, Florida’s measure would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution and roll back the state’s six-week ban on the procedure, which took effect in May. Earlier this month, Florida’s health department sent cease-and-desist letters to TV stations running an ad by Floridians Protecting Freedom, the campaign behind the measure. In the ad, a woman named Caroline speaks about being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant. “The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life and my daughter would lose her mom,” Caroline says in the ad. “Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.” The letters said the claim that women can’t get life-saving abortions in Florida was “categorically false”, since Florida’s ban permits abortions in medical emergencies. “The fact is these ads are unequivocally false and detrimental to public health in Florida,” Jae Williams, the Florida department of health communications director, said in an email late on Thursday. However, doctors across the country have said abortion bans are worded so vaguely as to force them to deny people medically necessary abortions. A New York doctor recently said that she had treated a woman with an ectopic pregnancy – which is nonviable and potentially life-threatening if left untreated – who had been turned away from a Florida hospital. In response to the letters, Floridians Protecting Freedom sued the Florida surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, and John Wilson, the former general counsel for the state health department. At least one TV station stopped airing the ad, the coalition’s lawsuit alleged. On Thursday, Walker granted a temporary restraining order blocking Ladapo from taking any further action against broadcasters or other media outlets that might air ads by Floridians Protecting Freedom. “Of course, the surgeon general of Florida has the right to advocate for his own position on a ballot measure,” Walker wrote. “But it would subvert the rule of law to permit the state to transform its own advocacy into the direct suppression of protected political speech.” Over the last several weeks, Florida’s government, run by Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor, has sent law enforcement officials to investigate people who signed a petition to get the measure on the ballot, set up a webpage urging people not to vote for it, and issued a report suggesting the measure got on the ballot due to “a large number of forged signatures or fraudulent petitions”. Floridians Protecting Freedom has denied wrongdoing. Anti-abortion activists have since filed a lawsuit to remove the measure from the ballot or nullify votes cast for it.","2024-10-18T15:03:21Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/18/florida-abortion-ad"
"abortion","State abortion bans are forcing doctors to provide substandard care – new study","More than two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, state abortion bans are forcing doctors to provide substandard medical care, new research released Monday shows. The study describes how one woman, whose water broke too early on her pregnancy, ended up in the ICU with severe sepsis because she could not get an abortion to end her doomed pregnancy. Her story is one of dozens of narratives collected by the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, which is housed at the University of California, San Francisco. Another woman’s liver transplant was canceled because doctors discovered that she was pregnant – even though the pregnancy was unwanted. Yet another was forced to give birth to a baby with anencephaly, a severe and fatal fetal anomaly. By the time the baby was handed over to the mother, the baby’s skin had turned from pink to navy. “The scream and wailing she let out once she saw the baby was soul-crushing and enough to break everyone in the room,” a medical student recounted to researchers. “The mother kept screaming ‘Why, God?’ in Spanish over and over, but this was not a problem up to the divine, but rather a completely man-made problem.” Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health first started collecting narratives from doctors about their post-Roe experiences in August 2022, shortly after Roe fell in the supreme court case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The group published a preliminary report of their findings in May 2023; they have collected a total of 86 narratives. “One question that we had was: were the changes that we were seeing initially related to the initial shock of the Dobbs decisions and the laws that then went into effect? Would clinical protocols kind of adjust and healthcare providers would figure out how to provide high-quality care? Would these poor-quality cases disappear?” said Dr Daniel Grossman, the lead author on the study. “These cases are continuing to happen.” Since Roe’s demise, more than a dozen states have totally banned abortion. Every state with a ban on the books technically allows abortions in cases of medical emergencies, but the exact details of what constitutes an “emergency” can differ from state to state. Doctors across the country have said that exceptions in abortion bans are worded so vaguely and confusingly that they are unworkable in practice. Ideally, if doctors realize a patient is careening towards a medical emergency, they act as swiftly as possible. Abortion bans, doctors have said, force them to wait to act until patients are on the brink of death. Some patients experienced massive, life-threatening blood loss after being delayed care for miscarriages, according to the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health report. One doctor in a state with an abortion ban told researchers that staffers at a hospital declined to help a woman who was in severe pain in the midst of a miscarriage. “I will never forget this case because I overheard the primary provider say to a nurse that so much as offering a helping hand to a patient getting onto the gurney while in the throes of a miscarriage could be construed as ‘aiding and abetting an abortion’. Best not to so much as touch the patient who is miscarrying,” the doctor said. “A gross violation of common sense and the oath I took when I got into this profession to soothe my patients’ suffering.” “Some of the clinicians talked about wanting to move to a state where abortion was still legal, even though they weren’t primarily abortion providers,” Grossman said. Most patients described in the report were between the ages of 18 and 35, and were dealing with second-trimester pregnancy complications, ectopic pregnancies (which are nonviable), fetal anomalies or miscarriages. Black and Latinx patients were, researchers noted, disproportionately represented; research has long shown that they are more likely to endure substandard care. Patients who were in some way connected to the carceral system also faced obstacles to care. In one case, a 15-year-old in juvenile detention had a baby because she could not get an abortion in her state. In another case, a woman who was on parole in a state with an abortion ban asked for permission to leave for an abortion and was denied. She left the state anyway for the procedure, but refused sedation because she feared being drug tested. There is little quantitative research into how abortion bans are affecting medical care, Grossman said, although one study has uncovered a link between Texas’s six-week abortion ban – which was in effect for about 10 months before Dobbs ushered in a near-total ban – and an increase in infant deaths. Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health continues to receive reports from doctors, Grossman said, although the number of submissions has declined. “I think part of the reason that the number of submissions has gone down is that clinicians have become kind of inured to this,” he said. “This has now become the new normal, and it’s no longer as shocking. They’re also just really burnt out and frustrated by not being able to provide the care that they were trained to provide.”","2024-09-09T10:00:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/09/state-abortion-bans-doctor-care-pregnancy"
"abortion","US ‘undermining global health’ by threatening to strip funding from aid projects that do not fit its political agenda","The Trump administration plans to export its “war on woke” by forcing foreign governments, non-governmental organisations and international bodies to abandon working on diversity, equity and inclusion or face being stripped of US funding. The plans have been called an attack on other nations’ sovereignty and one health organisation warned of “unimaginable effects” including a rise in deaths and violence, as safe clinics for vulnerable groups close. Under the Mexico City policy, also known as the “global gag rule”, foreign health organisations that provide information, referrals or services for abortion are already denied US funds, but the policy will now be extended to those deemed to promote what is loosely termed “gender ideology” or any initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Governments and major multilateral organisations such as UN agencies are likely to fall under the policy for the first time and will face “very hard choices” over whether to stick with policies and programmes that fight discrimination, at the risk of losing a major source of funding, global health experts said. While US officials have yet to set out what they mean by DEI initiatives, there is scope for it to include vast swathes of healthcare and support for people in crisis. Young women and teenage girls in Africa account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections, but programmes specifically supporting them could fall under the DEI umbrella. Vaccination programmes that rely specifically on training female workers, who can go into women’s homes to provide care where men could not, might collapse. Washington is negotiating new bilateral agreements with dozens of countries, and campaigners have urged governments to reject any US money that comes with those conditions. The global gag rule has been implemented under every Republican president since Reagan. It means any foreign organisations receiving US global health funding must certify that neither it, nor any other NGO with which it works, promotes or provides abortion, even with money from other donors. The Trump administration reportedly plans to expand its scope so that it also covers “gender ideology and diversity, equity and inclusion activities”. While not yet formally announced by the US state department, reports suggest the expanded rule would also apply to US-based NGOs, foreign governments, the UN and multilateral organisations for the first time, as well as all non-military foreign aid. Approached for confirmation, a senior state department official said: “The state department continues to advance President Trump’s American First foreign policy. “The department will soon take additional steps to close loopholes that allowed taxpayer funding for promotion of abortion in previous iterations of the Mexico City policy and expand the scope of the policy to ensure every penny of US foreign assistance prioritises American values, not the woke agenda,” the official said. Beth Schlachter, MSI’s senior director for US external relations, called the reports “deeply concerning”. She said: “Such a move, which goes far beyond previous restrictions, would be an insidious encroachment on sovereignty, pressuring governments to change their own laws and policies in exchange for US funding, despite repeated claims to respect national autonomy. “It risks causing real human suffering, undermining global health and destabilising decades of partnerships and progress,” she said. Shortly after taking office, Trump pledged to “terminate every diversity, equity and inclusion program across the entire federal government”. The administration has also attacked DEI policies in overseas businesses with US government contracts, in academia and scientific research, and in multilateral organisations such as Unicef. Rajat Khosla, director of the Partnership of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, said the interventions had already created a “chilling effect” and an expanded global gag rule would have “unimaginable effects”. The America First global health strategy published by the US state department in September set out plans to create more bilateral agreements with aid-recipient countries in place of working via NGOs. Khosla added: “For countries desperate for external aid, this would present some very hard choices.” Beirne Roose-Snyder, senior policy fellow of the Council for Global Equality, said equity initiatives played a big role in successful health programmes globally, which often required “special intentional effort” to target specific groups, such as LGBTQ+ people. She stressed that the restrictions were not “about what can be done with US funds” but sought to control what organisations and governments did outside US-funded work. Roose-Snyder said the new rules looked likely to apply even to humanitarian spending. “The administration wants to be able to do ‘ideological purity’ testing before helping after [a natural disaster, such as] a tsunami,” she said. She said key questions about the definition of “promotion of gender ideology” and DEI had yet to be answered, urging organisations to wait until they had formal notification before making any changes. Yumnah Hattas, gender justice lead at Frontline Aids, said the expanded plans were “in line with the rising transnational anti-rights movement” and would mean “human rights will be violated at a large scale”. She said the global gag rule historically had forced abortions to go underground and led to women dying. The extension had the potential to affect areas including “access to contraception, HIV prevention and gender-based violence services”, she said, predicting increases in pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections and HIV, and domestic violence. Hattas said: “We need to be going to governments and saying, ‘refuse US government funding, find the funds within your own government.’” Such a stance was “complicated and difficult and painful”, she acknowledged, but added: “If you ignore the US government, then it doesn’t matter any more. Then the global impact of the global gag rule no longer exists because it was rejected by the globe.”","2025-10-08T10:00:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/08/us-trump-administration-forcing-other-countries-un-drop-dei-diversity-initiatives-or-lose-funding"
"abortion","The legal battle over abortion-by-mail in the US has begun – and the stakes are high","The legal battle over the interstate mailing of abortion pills has begun. On Friday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, sued Dr Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based OB-GYN and reproductive justice activist, over what he alleges was Carpenter’s choice to mail abortion pills from New York to a 20-year-old pregnant woman in Texas. The lawsuit, filed in a Texas state court but almost certainly the beginning of a federal legal battle, marks the first formal legal challenge by an anti-abortion attorney general against a Democratic-controlled state’s shield laws, which protect abortion providers from out-of-state liability, and is slated to test how far pro-choice states can go to protect providers within their state borders – and how much force anti-choice states can give to their abortion bans beyond theirs. The alleged facts go something like this: sometime last summer, a young Texas woman from the Dallas suburbs discovered that she was pregnant, and contacted one of Carpenter’s advocacy organizations seeking access to abortion medication. Carpenter is part of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, or Act, a national network of doctors located in pro-choice states that dispense abortion medication through the mail; she has also worked with the abortion access advocacy groups Hey Jane and AidAccess. Through the group, Carpenter prescribed the woman the pills, which she took as directed. The woman’s abortion was discovered by authorities after the patient, concerned about heavy bleeding, asked her boyfriend to take her to the hospital. The Texas attorney general’s complaint makes repeated, disconcerting reference to the fact that the boyfriend had evidently not been told about the pregnancy and abortion before this, suggesting that he was entitled to the information or had somehow been wronged. Doctors like Carpenter have become a central part of the public health and civil rights response to Dobbs. They have stepped in to provide American women with the safety and dignity that their states seek to deny them. An estimated 8,000 women in ban states access pills by mail every single month, getting prescriptions from doctors like Carpenter in safe states and from providers located abroad. The ability to access the pills this way has meant that the abortions being conducted in these states, outside of clinical settings, are overwhelmingly safe. The pills, that is, keep women from seeking out the much more dangerous illegal surgical abortions, whose incompetent or careless administration by black market providers were the source of large numbers of deaths in the pre-Roe era. Doctors like Carpenter, then, do not merely give their patients control over their own bodies and destinies; in giving them a safe, reliable way to end their pregnancies in ban states, they may well be saving these women’s lives. It is this safe, effective and accessible form of self-managed abortion that the state of Texas is trying to end. Now, Paxton’s office is claiming that Carpenter, though she never set foot in the state of Texas, violated Texas state law. Further, Paxton believes that Texas’s law can reach all the way to New York: the suit aims to make Texas’s law shape the conduct of people outside its borders, curtailing both Carpenter’s medical practice and her freedom of expression. Texas’s suit will quickly force a confrontation over one prominent obstacle: New York’s abortion shield law. In the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade, many Democratic-controlled state legislatures, anticipating an influx of abortion seekers from out of state and lawsuits seeking to prevent women from accessing care in places where it is legal, passed laws seeking to protect abortion providers in their states from lawsuits and prosecutions brought by Republican state governments. Known as shield laws, these bills prevent any state resources from being used to cooperate with abortion lawsuits and prosecutions. That means that, by law, the state of New York cannot cooperate with Paxton’s lawsuit, and they can’t force Carpenter to do so, either. This conflict – between New York’s attempt to protect abortion and Texas’s increasingly expansive attempts to eradicate it – is the conflict that will probably arrive in federal court. When it gets there, it will raise some fraught constitutional questions. If Dobbs was based partly on a states’ rights argument, about the freedom of states such as Texas to ban abortion – as Brett Kavanaugh said – then do pro-choice states also have a similar right to robustly enforce their own preferred abortion policy? Or do states like Texas, with their anti-choice agendas, get to have a longer arm, extending their own policy preferences beyond their borders and compelling other states to help enforce them? The looming conflict over whether states such as New York have a right to protect their abortion providers has reminded some historians of the constitutional conflict that arose over slavery in the 19th century: when enslaved people escaped the south, and made their way to free states, slave states cried foul, and tried to compel the free northern states to kidnap and return the fugitives to enslavement. The federal government ultimately agreed, resolving the issue with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which forced free states to help slave states enforce slavery by returning escapees to captivity. But in attempting to solve a legal problem, the Fugitive Slave Act created a political one: free states resented the imposition of the slave states’ will on their own policy and functioning, and their anger over being forced to participate in a legal system they found morally abhorrent eventually contributed to the outbreak of the civil war. In questions of people’s essential freedoms, it is not sustainable for the country to be divided between freedom in some states and unfreedom in others. The two world views – between liberty and restriction, equality and hierarchy enforced by law – cannot abide one another. The country must choose. Now, as Texas seeks to force the issue, it looks like it will eventually be the US supreme court that decides.

"abortion","Supreme court considering taking up case challenging legality of same-sex marriage ","The US supreme court on Friday is considering taking up a case that could challenge the legality of same-sex marriage across the country. Hours after ruling that Donald Trump’s administration can block transgender and non-binary people from selecting passport sex markers that align with their gender identity, the justices are holding their first conference on the Davis v Ermold case. While their deliberations are typically kept private, the court may announce whether it will take the case as early as Monday. The case involves Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who, in 2015, became a cause celebre for religious opposition to same-sex marriage after the US supreme court legalized the practice in the Obergefell v Hodges case. Davis repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and, at the height of her fame, was even briefly jailed for contempt of court. Two men, David Ermold and David Moore, sued Davis after she refused to give them a marriage license. After a trial, a jury awarded the couple $100,000 in damages. Davis appealed that decision, arguing that her conduct was protected by the first amendment’s guarantee of free exercise of religion. The US court of appeals for the sixth circuit, however, rejected that argument in March of this year. Because Davis was operating within her capacity as a government official, she was not entitled to first amendment protections, the judges ruled. “When an official’s discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the constitution must win out,” the judges wrote. “The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official’s conscience so dictates.” Now Davis wants the 6-3 conservative majority supreme court to overturn that ruling. Much of her petition to the high court focused on her contention that she deserves some form of protection from liability. “Anything less would leave the first amendment’s promises hollow to those who agree to public service and are sued for exercising their religious beliefs during that time,” her brief declared. The brief also urged the supreme court to overturn Obergefell entirely. As part of their argument, attorneys for Davis praised the court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v Wade and claimed that Obergefell is “not grounded in the nation’s history or traditions” – a paraphrase of the reasoning that the court used to demolish Roe and erase the federal right to abortion. Davis is being represented by Liberty Counsel, an organization that has previously represented anti-abortion activists. While at least one advocacy group is planning to protest outside the supreme court on Friday, some legal experts have cautioned that the case remains a legal long shot. Because most of Davis’s arguments deal with the narrower question of her liability rather than the broader debate over same-sex marriage, the justices do not necessarily need to touch Obergefell to reckon with the questions at the heart of her case. There is no guarantee that the supreme court will take up Davis’s case after its conference. Each term, the court receives somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 requests to consider cases, but ultimately hears oral arguments in about 80 and issues orders in another 100, according to official estimates released by the supreme court. Justices also usually consider dozens of cases at each conference and tend to consider cases at multiple conferences before deciding to take them up. Four justices must agree in order for a case to be heard at oral arguments. If the justices do use this case to tamper with Obergefell, Ermold and Moore’s brief in the case argued that it would entice other officials to break laws they do not support in the hopes of being bailed out by the high court. “A decade since Obergefell, there are now nearly 800,000 married same-sex couples living across the United States,” their brief argued. “Overruling Obergefell could call into question the constitutional status of existing same-sex marriages and disrupt the lives of those who aspire to, plan their affairs around and benefit from same-sex marriage.”","2025-11-07T15:37:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/07/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage"
"abortion","I thought Britain was worlds away from Trump’s America – until I needed to get an abortion","Roughly 36 hours after I first heard about the horrifying Maga taunt “your body, my choice”, I learned that I was pregnant, despite having a contraceptive coil. My relief that I lived in the UK, not the US – where abortion is rapidly becoming illegal or inaccessible at best – was profound. Yet I realised that I had no idea how to access abortion, having complacently assumed that it would always be available if I needed it. Some fraught Googling led me to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. A couple of days later, I had my first appointment and very quickly learned that it wasn’t purely “my choice”, even in Britain. Of all the words you don’t want to hear by surprise, “transvaginal” is up there. I thought the scan to determine how pregnant I was would be the kind where a technician slathers goop on your stomach. I wasn’t told until I arrived that it would be internal, because of the assumed early gestation. A second surprise: the coil was gone, most likely sucked out by my period cup. Later that day, I had a phone consultation. The nurse told me two doctors would have to sign off on the termination and asked me to justify why my life would be negatively affected if I were forced to continue with the pregnancy. Horrified, I said I should just be able to say: I don’t want to. She was extremely kind and agreed, but said this was a legal requirement under the Abortion Act. I told her I lived hundreds of miles from my partner. We hadn’t been together very long and were united on this. I lived in a one-bedroom flat. I could barely afford my own life. My career would suffer. The presence – or so I thought – of a coil should show that I had been actively warding against pregnancy. What more did she want? I am bullish in the face of authority I disagree with, but felt furious for any less headstrong person seeking an abortion – already grappling with guilt and overwhelmed at dealing with the medical establishment – who might doubt their own needs when confronted in this way. Accessing abortion is like a full-time job, one that sent me to three clinics across north, south and deep west London in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible. If I had waited for a local appointment – or if a restrictive job or childcare prevented me from travelling – it would have been another two weeks of increasing nausea, exhaustion and soreness. Termination was not an emotional decision for me and my partner, but the process was beyond draining, even with friends’ loving support. So was dealing with well-meaning people who projected sadness on to the situation. I asked them to talk to me as if I were having a wisdom tooth out (except you don’t need two doctors to sign off on that). On our way to west London for the termination last Monday, I read the Guardian’s interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg, who believes abortion is “morally indefensible” even in cases of rape or incest. I vibrated with rage while we navigated a delayed Northern line in a panic. What is morally indefensible is the notion that any woman or person who can bear children should have to live with the unwitting products of such violence. If doctors must be satisfied that continued pregnancy would cause “grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman”, I defy any situation to more accurately meet those requirements. I had the sense, as a person going through it, that even in the UK the decision to terminate is perceived by some as frivolous, a luxury; not a frankly violating last resort that often leaves you struggling to advocate for yourself in the midst of appalling pain. The male doctor doing my procedure told me period cups were unhygienic and that it was better to use tissue. (The Lancet cites studies that say cups are less likely to cause infection than tampons or pads.) “Spoken like someone who has never had periods,” I said, exchanging a look with the female nurse. “I mean pads,” he stuttered from between my legs. Not that I wasn’t naive: I had no idea that abortion is still technically illegal in Great Britain unless certain conditions are met. You might think: if abortion remains accessible, surely this is just a technicality. But there has been a sudden rise in women being prosecuted for having so-called illegal abortions, with reports of healthcare providers breaching patient confidentiality. This continuing criminalisation enables the erosion of rights. The new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, voted in 2022 against legislation to introduce buffer zones around abortion clinics and hospitals to limit harassment by anti-abortion protesters, and against the government’s “pills by post” scheme to facilitate home abortion without in-person consultation (both laws passed). Another Conservative amendment earlier this year aimed to reduce the abortion limit to 22 weeks. Labour must move forward with decriminalising abortion (a cross-party proposal to decriminalise it up to 24 weeks was shelved after this year’s snap election) and enact rigorous protections for anyone seeking such healthcare as a matter of urgency, particularly as it faces the threat of a Tory party that is an existential concession to Reform UK – one that leans further right, socially, than many people of reproductive age will have experienced in our lifetimes. Any person seeking abortion is already going through enough stress without being subject to a system that legitimises a culture of shame and suspicion. It must also make that fight intersectional. Two days before my abortion, I still ran a 10k that I had entered months prior, determined not to be stopped. Without really thinking about it, I started my playlist with Planningtorock’s Get Your Fkng Laws Off My Body. It’s a techno anthem about transgender rights, but I hadn’t anticipated how Jam Rostron’s lyrics would gut me that morning. It viscerally underscored that denying bodily autonomy to any group legitimises all denial of bodily autonomy – a basic fact missed by anyone who sees the rights of one group as an attack on another. “My body, my choice” is just another empty slogan if it doesn’t apply to everyone. Now on the other side in a state of stunned relief – and still furiously sore boobs – my only lasting shame is for my previous ignorance, at having learned the hard way that obtaining abortion in the UK isn’t that easy at all. I am bottomlessly grateful that I didn’t have to cross state lines, but the process still felt, at points, like touching the hem of powerlessness. It felt awful.

"abortion","‘We’re ready to fight’: activists brace as US anti-rights figures descend on Africa","Advocates for sexual, reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights in Africa are bracing themselves for an influx of some of the most powerful, ultra-conservative campaigners from the US, Poland, Switzerland and the Netherlands over the coming months. The prominent campaigners, who all oppose abortion, transgender and LGBTQ+ rights, and are against sexuality education, are due to speak at a series of conferences focused on African “family values” and “national sovereignty”. Austin Ruse, a former Breitbart columnist and president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam); Bettina Roska, a legal officer based in Geneva at the US conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF); and the Dutch founder of Christian Council International, Henk Jan van Schothorst, are among the most notable figures in the global anti-rights movement scheduled to address the Pan-African Conference on Family Values in Nairobi on 12-17 May. Also appearing will be MPs from Uganda and Malawi, Kenyan lawyers and the Africa campaigns director for CitizenGO, Ann Kioko, who calls herself “the most feared” anti-abortion activist in Africa on X. C-Fam and ADF are designated as hate groups by the US monitoring group Southern Poverty Law Center, as is Family Watch International, another backer. Hosted by the Africa Christian Professionals Forum, with a focus on “promoting and protecting the sanctity of life, family values and religious freedom”, the Nairobi event has sent chills through activists and health workers in Kenya and beyond, who fear their work will become much more difficult at a time when the second Trump term has supercharged a “freefall” of rights globally. Nelly Munyasia, director of Reproductive Health Network Kenya (RHNK), says there is nothing African about the agenda being pushed under the guise of family values. “They claim it is African, and yet it’s not African. Africa values are pegged on love and living together as a community. “They are perpetrators of hate,” she says, with their anti-abortion stance “predisposing women to death”. As a result of her advocacy work and efforts to improve access to health information and services, Munyasia has been attacked online and called a “murderer” and a “killer”, accused of “leading young people to hell” by anti-abortion groups. Okwara Masafu, a human rights lawyer at Kenya’s National Gay &amp; Lesbian Human Rights Commission , fears the conference will catapult Kenya’s family protection bill through parliament. The 2023 bill proposes harsh anti-LGBTQ+ laws including life imprisonment for homosexuality, and a number of bans targeted at the LGBTQ+ community including public displays of “amorous relations”, cross-dressing and protests. “This conference is going to solidify the push-through of the family protection bill,” she says. “We can’t overstate the harm it will do.” The Pan-African Conference on Family Values is one of four significant gatherings taking place in Africa over the next four months. This weekend, Uganda will host the third Interparliamentary Forum on Family, Sovereignty and Values. It is reportedly being sponsored, as it was last year, by Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccination advocacy organisation founded by the US secretary of health, Robert F Kennedy Jr. The first Interparliamentary Forum was attended by Sharon Slater, founder of Family Watch International (FWI), another organisation accused of spreading hate and homophobia, and the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, who signed the draconian Anti-Homosexuality Act weeks later in May 2023. According to a CNN investigation, FWI even helped shape the legislation, which is one of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws with penalties including life in prison or the death penalty in some cases. The group denies that it was involved in lobbying for this law. Kenya’s family protection bill, which aims to outlaw same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ activities, public cross-dressing and related advocacy campaigns, was submitted by the opposition MP Peter Kaluma shortly after he attended the 2023 conference in Uganda, suggesting that such gatherings not only “stunt and reverse rights but also allow for sharing tactics and resources”, according to Joy Asasira, a reproductive and gender justice campaigner in east Africa. In June, the Mormons, or Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will host a conference entitled Strengthening Families in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, with Mormon leaders taking key roles alongside the country’s first lady, Fatima Maada Bio, and Ivory Coast’s minister of family, women and children, Nasseneba Touré Diané. The presence of the first lady is “worrying”, says Ramatu Bangura, co-chief executive at Purposeful, a hub for girls’ activism in Sierra Leone, because Fatima Bio has, in the past, championed the rights of girls and women. Bangura is concerned that the Strengthening Families conference will affect the passing of a landmark bill that could overturn the country’s British colonial-era abortion ban, legalising a termination at up to 14 weeks for any reason and at any stage under certain conditions. Previous attempts at decriminalising abortion in Sierra Leone have failed because of lobbying from religious and anti-abortion groups. Although Bangura believes Sierra Leone’s president, Julius Maada Bio, supports reproductive rights, she describes the pressure from these groups as “intensive”. “Anti-abortion groups have raised their profile, and are much more adept and astute at their efforts. They’ve seen successes in places like Uganda and Ghana, so they feel emboldened,” says Bangura. She suspects the delay to the bill, which is going through parliament, is due to the conference, which will act as a “rallying point” for the anti-rights movement. In August, Advocates Africa, a network of Christian lawyers and law students, is hosting a conference in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, with backing from ADF. ADF’s application for observer status at the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2023 was rejected, but Saoyo Tabitha Griffith, a Kenyan lawyer and activist at a gender rights organisation, says it was a clear example of western actors trying to increase their influence on the continent, as a means to “weaponise morality and other issues like ‘family’ and ‘African’ values to trigger massive legal reforms”. “This is not just an attempt to infiltrate these bodies to export their hateful agenda; it is also intended to give them more credibility within the African continental context,” says Griffith. These conferences are not new, but observers say the support they are getting from leading figures in the global anti-rights movement is a significant development. “This is the first time in the history of our tracking that we are seeing new faces [at these conferences] such as La Manif pour tous [a French anti-transgender and anti LGBTQ+ group], Ordo luris [a ultra-conservative Polish Catholic group] and Political Network for Values [a global far-right network that rejects abortion and equal marriage] openly advertising themselves as sponsors and speakers at an African conference,” says Griffith. At one point the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was rumoured to be attending the Nairobi conference in a move activists believe was calculated to give credibility and weight to the event. “[These conferences are] an opportunity for back-channel advocacy,” says Sarah Shaw, associate director of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, an organisation that provides safe abortion services around the world. “All it takes is an invitation letter to go out and they can list Rubio as a speaker tbc, and if they are lucky it will get kicked down the chain. It is a tactic, but one that would not have been possible before Trump’s second term. It sends a very clear message to other governments in the region that this is now the mainstream.” All four conferences are framed around family values, protecting religious rights and national sovereignty. “It’s only when you start digging and you look at the narrative surrounding them,” says Shaw. “It’s family, but it’s a very heteronormative version of the family.” Activists across the region are mobilising to counter the idea that African cultural values are under threat, as suggested by the anti-rights movement, and expose it for what it is: an attempt to maintain colonial-era laws that, in Bangura’s words, “were never in the interest of our people in our communities”. Munyasia says: “Debunking their disinformation and providing the right information for everyone is essential.” The Women’s Probono Initiative, a legal and advocacy organisation for women and girls in Uganda, has issued a statement expressing its alarm at the conferences in Uganda and Kenya, and warning that “family protection” policies are a smokescreen for oppressing women. “While we welcome critical discussions around strengthening families … we recognise from prior similar ‘family conferences’’ that what they seek to do is strip women of their basic human rights and dignity and reinforce the dominance of men within our society using family values as a vehicle,” it says. Munyasia’s organisation is among the signatories of a petition criticising the venue for hosting the Pan-African Conference on Family Values. Boma hotel is co-owned by Red Cross Kenya, and is “complicit in enabling this harmful gathering”, it says. The Guardian has approached Red Cross Kenya for comment, but has yet to receive a response. Purposeful has been collaborating with women’s rights activists and organisations across Africa to strategise and learn from one another. On 25 May it will co-publish a report, Until Everybody Is Free, aimed at African feminists and young activists with information on networks, strategies and funding of organised opposition to rights and gender justice on the continent. “We’re ready for a battle; we’re ready to fight, and we understand what the stakes are,” says Bangura. “These forces that are coming into our country from outside are designed to take us back to a colonial era that we’re not interested in going back to.”","2025-05-09T11:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/09/africa-family-values-anti-rights-conferences-conservative-christian-abortion-lgbtq-gender-uganda-kenya-rwanda"
"abortion","This play’s abortion scene made grown men faint – and I’m thrilled it’s about to get a bigger audience","Following a sold-out run at the Almeida theatre, this month The Years – a stage adaptation of Annie Ernaux’s choral novel of 21st-century womanhood – transfers to the West End. The play became somewhat notorious because of the impact that its abortion scene was having on audience members. In the scene, a bloodied Romola Garai recounts passing a dead foetus after an illegal backstreet abortion, a performance our theatre critic described as “devastating”. A preview last summer had to be stopped as several audience members requested medical assistance, while another shouted at the cast that the scene had been “a disgrace” and protested that “there was no warning” (content notes were, in fact, provided). As I wrote in the autumn, I had assumed these fainters were women, triggered by the trauma of past experiences, but that was sexist of me. It was in fact mostly men who were passing out, and a man who yelled at the cast. No one fainted when I saw the play, but someone did leave, and another audience member, head in hands, looked distinctly green about the gills. As the play opens to even larger audiences and more exposure, it will be interesting to see if the faintings – and the headlines – continue, or if staging the play in a less intimate theatre changes the scene’s impact. Personally, I have a feeling we’ll see more swooning men before the run is out. I think the reaction goes beyond simple haemophobia. In the scene, Garai’s character says of the procedure: “This thing has no place in language”, making explicit Ernaux’s artistic endeavour to create precisely that: a language of abortion. She set out to bring light to a subject that for so long had been considered a hidden, private “women’s problem” cloaked in silence and shame. It is in her short work Happening, her account of her own backstreet abortion, that she approached this linguistic and artistic vacuum, and it is from this short, autobiographical piece of writing, rather than from The Years, that the scene has been taken. In Happening, Ernaux writes: “I don’t believe there is a single museum in the world whose collections feature a work called The Abortionist’s Studio.” Is it because of this vacuum, this absence of depiction and therefore exposure, that men are fainting in their seats? Historically, artistically, they have not been encouraged to put themselves in our shoes, to conceptualise and empathise with living in a female body – or the work that has attempted to do so has been marginalised and mocked. Throughout the 20th century, pioneering female artists have attempted to translate their bodily experience into art, from Frida Kahlo – who wanted to draw her baby’s body after her miscarriage but had to make do with medical drawings – to Paula Rego and Tracey Emin, whose film How it Feels recounts her own traumatic abortion. Getting to the point we are at now has been the work of decades. That an experience that is the lived reality of millions of women should still, in 2024, have such a visceral effect on some men speaks volumes. But then I have long suspected that not all men have theory of mind when the subject is female. Watching Killers of the Flower Moon recently, I found myself marvelling at how one of the leading figures, Mollie, has a child (and eventually more than one) who seemingly appears from nowhere. “Wait, what?” I said. “When did she give birth?” I love Scorsese as much as anyone else, but this film is three hours and 26 minutes long, and yet this highly significant bodily event barely registers. Why? I’m left wondering if it’s because Scorsese, like so many male creators, simply just didn’t think about childbirth, or how it must have felt for a Native American woman in the 1920s, in any real depth. Perhaps this is what is so shocking about The Years: could this be the first time that some audience members have actually really confronted what the reality of an abortion involves? There are of course many men who will have accompanied their partners to and supported them through abortions, and who have needed support themselves. Yet one wonders how many others, in that moment Garai stands on stage, are imagining the experience in detail for the very first time in their lives. Such is the powerful quality of the writing and the performance. In this current moment, such work is explicitly political. Moreover, in decrying this absence, Ernaux has created something of a chain reaction. Céline Sciamma’s film Portrait of a Lady on Fire has a scene that is a direct response to Ernaux’s statement about painting, the film Saint Frances was another nuanced depiction and Happening was turned into a film. Across poetry, prose and visual art there is also more and more exploration of the theme of abortion, and of the experience of living in a female body more generally. That’s already far more light being let in than when those in my generation were teenagers. Girls I knew were having abortions – and describing them to each other. I was 13 when I first heard a girl talk about what Garai talks about on stage – but on television there was little beyond Vera Drake. Sex education was rudimentary and came far too late, and period blood in advertisements was still blue. As one comment piece in response to the play argued, women play a part, too, in hiding their blood from their partners and sons. It’s not just about seeing it, though, it’s about being made to feel it. If that feels shocking, or even disgraceful, then it’s probably high time it happened.

"abortion","Florida sued over attempts to shut down TV ad in favor of abortion rights","The coalition behind a Florida ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution sued the state’s health department on Wednesday over its attempts to shut down an television advertisement supporting the measure. The lawsuit is the latest volley in an escalating war between the coalition, Floridians Protecting Freedom, and Florida’s rightwing government, which has alarmed civil rights groups, fair elections organizations and even the Federal Communications Commission over its tactics to undermine the ballot initiative, which will appear before voters in November. Earlier this month, the Florida health department sent cease-and-desist letters to local news stations over an ad featuring a woman, identified as Caroline from Tampa, Florida, who speaks about being diagnosed with brain cancer while pregnant. “The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,” Caroline says in the ad. “Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.” The letters, which were signed by John Wilson, Florida health department general counsel, said the claim that women can’t get life-saving abortions in Florida was “categorically false” and the state had the authority to criminally prosecute media outlets that continued to run Caroline’s ad. (Wilson left that job days after sending those letters.) At least one TV station stopped airing it, according to the lawsuit filed by Floridians Protecting Freedom. Although Florida’s six-week abortion ban permits the procedure in medical emergencies, doctors across the country say such exceptions are worded so vaguely that they force doctors to deny patients abortions or wait until they get sick enough to treat them legally. A New York doctor recently told the Guardian that she had treated a woman with an ectopic pregnancy – which is nonviable and potentially life-threatening if left untreated – who had been turned away from a Florida hospital. If Floridians successfully pass the pro-abortion rights ballot measure – which needs 60% of the vote to succeed – the state’s ban would be overturned. “The state of Florida’s crusade against amendment 4 is unconstitutional government interference – full stop,” Lauren Brenzel, director of the campaign for the ballot measure, said in a statement on Wednesday. “The state cannot coerce television stations into removing political speech from the airwaves in an attempt to keep their abortion ban in place.” Over the last several weeks, Florida’s government, led by its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has levied a series of attacks on the measure and its backers. Law enforcement officials have investigated people who signed a petition to get the measure on the ballot, while the Florida agency for healthcare administration created a website attacking the amendment. Floridians Protecting Freedom sued over that website, but a judge ruled it could remain up. On Friday, the Florida office of election crimes and security issued a report claiming that the agency believed Floridians Protecting Freedom may have “submitted a large number of forged signatures or fraudulent petitions” in support of the measure. In a statement, Brenzel denied the claims and said: “What we are seeing now is nothing more than dishonest distractions and desperate attempts to silence voters.” In its Wednesday lawsuit, which was filed in the US district court for the northern district of Florida in Tallahassee, Floridians Protecting Freedom asks the court to declare the cease-and-desist letters to be “unconstitutional coercion and viewpoint discrimination” and to block Florida’s government from following through on their threats of prosecution of media outlets. “Opponents of the measure are, of course, free to engage in their own oppositional speech,” the lawsuit reads, “but the state cannot use its coercive powers as the state to attempt to chill or suppress the speech of FPF or others who would speak in support of the amendment or facilitate that speech”. The lawsuit names Wilson as a defendant in his individual capacity, as well as the Florida surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo. Florida’s health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Florida is one of 10 states with an abortion-related measure on the ballot this year. Although Nevada and Arizona – two key presidential battlegrounds – also have similar measures, Florida’s may be the most high-profile, because it would restore abortion access to a state that had become a southern abortion haven after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Its six-week ban went into effect earlier this year.","2024-10-16T15:22:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/florida-pro-abortion-ad-lawsuit"
"abortion","‘One death is too many’: abortion bans usher in US maternal mortality crisis","In Louisiana, doctors will no longer be able to carry a lifesaving medication with them during pregnancy emergencies. In Texas, the infant mortality rate is soaring. In Idaho, pregnant people drive hours just to give birth. And in Oklahoma and Georgia, women are bleeding out in hospital parking lots and facing dangerous infections before they can find care – and sometimes, that care comes too late. The limitations and outright bans on abortion that have taken hold in half of the US in the wake of the Dobbs decision have wreaked enormous changes to the reproductive health landscape. The restrictions put a growing burden on the health and wellbeing of patients and providers, even as more Americans find it difficult to find and access care. “The United States is, and has been for quite some time, in the midst of a maternal and infant mortality crisis,” said Dr Jamila Perritt, a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist and president of Physicians for Reproductive Health. Banning access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion care, is “directly causing an increase in morbidity and mortality in our community”, she said. “We have really robust evidence that shows us that when people have sought abortion care and are unable to obtain it, their psychological, social, physical and emotional health is harmed.” Maternal and infant mortality will probably increase because of the restrictions – especially if national limitations, like enforcement of the Comstock Act, are put into place. “I expect in the next few years, we’re going to start to see the infant mortality, pre-term birth, maternal mortality, and maternal morbidity numbers rise for everyone, and particularly for folks from racially marginalized and low-socioeconomic communities,” said Rachel Hardeman, professor of reproductive health and founding director of the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity at the University of Minnesota. Calculating mortality is often a complicated and controversial endeavor. When maternal mortality dropped in 2022, anti-abortion advocates credited the success to the Dobbs decision. But that’s not the case, according to new research in Jama Network Open. Maternal deaths surged during the first two years of the pandemic, when Covid, a deadly illness during pregnancy, accounted for one-quarter of all maternal deaths. But in 2022, that rate dropped to levels similar to pre-pandemic levels, from 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2021 to 22.3 in 2022. That rate is still higher than maternal mortality rates in peer nations, and research indicates it will increase if officials clamp down on abortion nationally – which, with the Comstock Act, would require no additional anti-abortion legislation or bans. Right now, “people can still travel to other states, but once there’s a federal ban, that won’t be an option any more,” says Amanda Jean Stevenson, co-author of the new Jama research and a sociologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “And there could be this very different set of outcomes when people’s options are gone.” In the United States, more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths and more than 60% of infant deaths in the first week are preventable – and those figures were estimated before the Dobbs decision. Because of abortion restrictions, there are already significant challenges to accessing reproductive healthcare – and it’s not just abortion care. In Louisiana, misoprostol – a drug used for medication abortion and other lifesaving purposes – will be labeled a controlled substance beginning on 1 October. One of its uses is keeping patients from bleeding out after childbirth, which is the No 1 cause of postpartum mortality. Yet physicians cannot keep controlled substances in their emergency carts, and they fear they won’t have enough time to fill prescriptions for patients when minutes and even seconds make the difference between life and death. In the year following Texas’s abortion ban, child mortality shot up by 12.9% – compared with a 1.8% increase in the rest of the country, according to a recent study. Congenital anomalies are the leading cause of infant death in the US – but while they went down by 3.1% in the rest of the country, they went up by 22.9% in Texas. “That study was chilling. That is a huge change,” Stevenson said. It echoed previous research finding that states with the most restrictive abortion laws saw 16% more infant deaths between 2014 and 2018. The trauma and costs of carrying to term pregnancies that are incompatible with life inflict an incalculable toll on families and providers. States are closing obstetric units and losing experienced providers who worry about not being able to offer lifesaving care as patients die on the table in front of them, and facing jail time if they provide care. More than two-thirds (68%) of obstetricians and gynecologists say the Dobbs decision has made it harder for them to respond to pregnancy-related emergencies, according to the non-partisan health research organization KFF. They also believe it has worsened mortality in pregnancy while increasing racial and ethnic inequities, and fewer doctors are now interested in entering the field. In 2022, soon after the Dobbs decision, medical residency applications dropped for states with bans. More than half of doctors surveyed in states with bans and limitations said they were very concerned about legal repercussions to providing the standard of care in pregnancy. “That can just exacerbate already pretty large gaps in the workforce,” said Usha Ranji, associate director for women’s health policy at KFF. In the past two years, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units entirely, according to a new March of Dimes report. More than one-third of US counties are now maternity care deserts, with no obstetricians or places to give birth. North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska have the least access to maternity care. The majority of rural hospitals (57%) no longer deliver babies, with more than 100 of the rural hospitals ending labor and delivery services in the past five years. “We’ve created policy and legislation to limit access to abortions and also have closed the exact places that people need to go to get care if they are pregnant,” Hardeman said. That puts pressure on neighboring states that still provide care, she said. “Where you live matters for your health. And I think that the Dobbs decision and the fall of Roe have demonstrated that in a very real and very obvious way, because there are literally places in this country where there is essentially no access to reproductive healthcare,” she said. “It started out in rural spaces, but more and more, there’s reports popping up of labor and delivery units closing in, like, urban Chicago.” In states with restrictions on abortion, women of color and pregnant people from low-income communities often suffer the most, said Hardeman. “Taking away access to reproductive healthcare is exacerbating those disparities.” Black women die because of pregnancy at twice the national rate, and three times more than white women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The fact that black women and birthing people are dying at three to four times greater risk than white women is shameful – and it’s preventable,” Perritt said. It’s important to shore up protections for reproductive health for all Americans before health complications and mortality rise even more, she said. “One death is too much. One is too many.”","2024-09-25T11:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/abortion-bans-healthcare-maternal-mortality"
"abortion","Gaza, abortion, immigration: where Kamala Harris stands on key issues","The first vice-president who is Black, of South Asian descent, or a woman versus a white man. The oldest presidential candidate in US history versus someone almost 20 years younger than him. The property mogul who inherited a fortune from his father versus the daughter of a biologist and a university professor in economics, both of whom are immigrants. If Kamala Harris becomes the nominee, then, as said in a 2020 Harris campaign ad shared widely after Biden resigned, Trump will be up against “the Anti-Trump”. But can she beat Trump? In order to do so, she will not only have to upend a history of American racism and sexism – in 200 years of US democracy, voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman – but get out the vote among a population disaffected with politics, by selling her policies on key issues – including the Israel-Hamas war, inflation, abortion, immigration and more. Gaza Though Harris has technically toed Biden’s line on Gaza, she is viewed as being more forceful when it comes to criticising Israel, and expressing empathy for Palestinians. When she delivered a speech in March in Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, her comments on Gaza were followed by sustained applause. “People in Gaza are starving. The conditions are inhumane. And our common humanity compels us to act,” she said. “Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire.” She added, after stopping for the applause, “for six weeks”. In the presidential primaries, more than 101,000 Michigan Democrats, about 13% of those who voted, cast ballots for “uncommitted”, after campaigning by anti-war organizers, winning two delegates to the Democratic national convention and awakening a modern anti-war movement that forced the president’s attention to Gaza. Abortion Democrats will be hoping that Harris, if she is the nominee, will have gender in her favour among Democratic voters, particularly since Roe v Wade was overturned by a supreme court with three judges appointed by Trump, who boasted this year: “We broke Roe v Wade.” Beginning in late 2023, Harris has embarked on a national tour to highlight the threats to reproductive rights posed by a second Trump administration – an issue that Biden has been criticized for shying away from. Biden has defended Roe v Wade, but has said he is “not big on abortion”. “As a woman on the ticket and the first woman VP and a woman of color, and then secondly, as an AG, she is strongest when her profile is fighting and prosecuting the case. People really like her in that mode,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic party strategist and a lead pollster on the 2020 Biden campaign, told the Guardian in March. “She’s so comfortable saying the word ‘abortion’. She’s so comfortable leaning in and speaking to the repercussions.” Trump has run against and defeated a woman before – Hillary Clinton. After Roe v Wade, more people may be motivated by the possibility of a female president who is clearly in favor of abortion rights. It will probably also motivate people who are anti-abortion to vote for Trump. Immigration Trump will try to show swing voters that his likely new rival has her fingerprints all over two issues he is counting on for victory in November: immigration and the cost of living, Reuters reported. The Trump campaign is already casting Harris as the “co-pilot” of administration policies it says are behind both sources of voter discontent. In anticipation of this moment, the Trump campaign has for weeks been preparing for the prospect of a Harris candidacy should Biden drop out and she win her party’s nomination. Trump’s campaign has signalled it will tie her as tightly as possible to Biden’s immigration policy, which Republicans say is to blame for a sharp increase in the number of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. As vice-president, Harris was charged with addressing the root causes of migration from northern triangle countries in Central America, not border policy as Republicans have long claimed. In that role, Harris announced $950m in 2023 to address the causes of immigration to North America from Latin America. She has been targeted by Republicans who have organised for asylum seekers to be driven on buses to Harris’s home on multiple occasions, including on Christmas Eve. In February this year, Harris said that the US migration system was “broken”, telling New York’s Spectrum News: “We know, and I think many people have known for a long time, that our immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed.” She was speaking after a bipartisan bill that would have seen the border closed if immigration reached a threshold was killed after Trump urged Republicans not to back it, the New York Times reports. As a senator, Harris was a strong advocate in favor of expanding work and legal pathways for Dreamers, people brought to the United States unlawfully as children. Inflation A second major line of attack against Harris by the Trump campaign team will centre on the economy. Public opinion polls consistently show Americans are unhappy with high food and fuel costs as well as interest rates that have made buying a home less affordable. “Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,” Trump said in a statement on Sunday. “They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.” June inflation figures were better than expected, with prices falling, lifting hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon cut interest rates. As inflation fell 0.1% on a monthly basis in June, having been unchanged in May, the consumer price index’s annual increase was also the smallest in a year. But the cost of living remains high, and people’s pockets will be front of mind in this election. The annual increase in consumer prices slowed significantly in June from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, which was their highest level in a generation. In an interview with NBC-affiliated WDSU, a local news channel, on 21 July, Harris addressed the cost of living. “The president and our administration’s probably highest priority is bringing down the price of gas and cost of living,” Harris said. “If it wasn’t clear before the pandemic it was certainly clear after, when people are sick they need to be able to stay home and not juggle that versus their ability to put food on the table,” she said. “So these are some things that we are going to continue to fight for.”","2024-07-22T14:00:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/22/kamala-harris-election-policies"
"abortion","April review – Dea Kulumbegashvili comes into her own with haunting abortion drama","Dea Kulumbegashvili is the much-admired Georgian director whose feature debut, Beginning, won golden opinions, though I confess to having been agnostic on the grounds of mannerisms that were a little derivative – some resemblances there to Carlos Reygadas and Michael Haneke. Her follow-up movie, April, is now presented at Venice. That month has never seemed crueller. The high arthouse influences are still detectable, but Kulumbegashvili has mastered and absorbed them and has an evolving film-language of her own, though still involving extended static takes, long shots in which people have inaudible but important conversations in the far distance, and explicit moments of violence whose shock is tempered and complicated by strangely exalted, if bizarre, visionary sequences. Nina (Ia Sukhitashvili) is an obstetrics doctor in deep trouble for having apparently mishandled a delivery that resulted in the baby’s death. She is well known for supplying under-the-counter contraceptive pills and carrying out unofficial, illegal abortions in outlying villages, and the grieving father – furiously and disapprovingly aware of her reputation – is now demanding an inquiry into her alleged malpractice, suspecting that Nina had secretly made a high-handed decision that his poverty stricken family would better off without another mouth to feed. Nina’s colleague and ex-partner (Kakha Kintsurashvili) is tasked with carrying out the investigation by the senior consultant, played by veteran Georgian actor Merab Ninidze. But this is not the least of it. Nina is deeply troubled by sexual dysfunction; she drives around into the outlying rural areas picking up men with whom she has compulsively violent encounters, a little like the piano teacher of Elfriede Jelinek’s novel and Haneke’s film adaptation. Her own repressed history of sexual and romantic pain and possible pregnancy is clearly being gestured at. Most startlingly of all, conventional dramatic scenes will be interspersed with strange silent sequences in which open landscapes and gloomy interiors appear to be haunted by a contorted wraith or monster. Is this a tormented ghost, an unquiet conscience? Surely not an adult foetus? This is not the usual “abortion” issue movie in which the reactionary anti-abortion authorities are straightforwardly criticised and the pregnant woman is awarded compassionate centre stage status – as in Audrey Diwan’s Happening. Nor does it precisely show the abortionist as oppressive or troubled, as in Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days or Mike Leigh’s Vera Drake. It is far more detached and affectless. However justified Nina is in providing terminations to terrified and victimised young women, her need to do so is not really a principled mission, but clearly a symptomatic part of some larger buried trauma. Yet the power of April is that it shows how very illusory the idea of modernity is. Nina is part of an up-to-date hospital that prides itself on modern medical techniques all-but-guaranteeing safe, hygienic childbirth, and the failure in this regard is a very serious matter that will be investigated using comparably up-to-date rigorous methods: open, transparent, accountable. But in these wide open spaces, the same old male attitudes and prejudices hold sway – effectively unchanged over centuries. Women’s bodies are at the mercy of men and Nina’s resistance to this is also an agonised and self-tormenting kind of submission. It is a deeply unsettling meditation on sexuality and transgression. • April screened at the Venice film festival, and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 25 April.","2024-09-05T14:30:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/05/april-review-dea-kulumbegashvili-abortion"
"abortion","Conspicuously absent from Republican convention was any mention of abortion","When he took the stage four years ago at the 2020 Republican national convention, Donald Trump made sure to rail against Democrats over their support for abortion rights. “Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul?” Trump boomed. “Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a god-given right to life.” But this year, during his Thursday night speech at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Trump did not proudly declare anything about the “unborn”. In fact, he was conspicuously silent on the topic of abortion – as were almost all of the other speakers at the 2024 convention. Even JD Vance, Trump’s outspoken new running mate and an Ohio senator with a history supporting a national abortion ban, did not bring it up in his Wednesday speech. The RNC’s vanishing act on abortion is a reflection of Republicans’ recent uncertainty about how, exactly, to talk about the issue. For decades, opposing the procedure was a pillar of the party. Republicans spent years attacking Roe v Wade and pushing state-level abortion restrictions, a crusade that culminated in the overturning of Roe in 2022. Trump played a pivotal role in ending the national right to abortion: he nominated three of the justices that voted for it. But in the years since, opposition to abortion seems to have become ballot box poison. Outrage over Roe’s downfall is credited with slowing a much-promised “red wave” in the 2022 midterms. Voters in states like Ohio, Vance’s home state, and Michigan, a key battleground in the 2024 elections, have passed ballot measures to enshrine abortion rights in their states’ constitutions. The GOP has taken notice. Many Republicans, including Vance, have started to publicly downplay their anti-abortion stances. In Arizona, a major swing state, a handful of Republicans even defected and voted in favor of repealing a near-total abortion ban. Trump, who likes to intermittently take credit for overturning Roe, has at various points suggested he would support a national abortion ban, said that states should decide and implied they should not go too far. All this has alarmed some anti-abortion activists, who have clocked the Republican party’s retreat. A wing of the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, Students for Life Action, sent out a press release ahead of Trump’s Thursday speech that highlighted Republicans’ silence on the issue. After the anti-abortion movement spent decades amassing votes and dollars for GOP candidates, the group indicated that its members were no longer certain of their welcome at the convention. “The GOP can and must do better,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action and a former Republican National Committee staffer, said in a statement. “Pro-life Americans don’t expect political leaders to have all the answers, which is why we are laying out for the GOP our framework for a new deal to ensure an end to the weaponized pro-abortion policy that has tainted the Biden-Harris record.” Reception to the GOP’s platform has been mixed among anti-abortion activists. Hawkins praised the platform for its opposition to abortions later in pregnancy as well as its citation of the 14th amendment, which some abortion opponents believe should establish full legal rights and protections for embryos and fetuses. Such an interpretation of the 14th amendment would likely rewrite vast swathes of US law, from tax codes to traffic laws around carpool lanes. But, for the first time in 40 years, the Republican party’s platform did not call for a national abortion ban. Instead, it suggested that states should decide their own abortion laws. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, told Politico he had originally wanted to publicly fight over the platform and its lack of federal proposals on abortion. However, he abandoned those plans after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt last weekend. “Don’t take our silence as being indifferent to what took place,” he said. “It’s just timing.” Democrats, meanwhile, are anything but silent on abortion. Since swing states like Arizona and Nevada are set to vote on abortion-related ballot measures in November, Democrats are hoping those measures will boost turnout among their base. Joe Biden’s campaign has also dispatched Kamala Harris on a months-long tour of the country in support of abortion rights – which may well now be Democrats’ most persuasive issue on the campaign trail.","2024-07-19T16:55:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/19/republican-convention-abortion"
"abortion","Child rape survivors face extraordinary barriers in states with abortion bans","As children in Texas, A and her sister were raped multiple times by their stepfather and his friends before she found she was pregnant earlier this year. “We both had STDs because none of them used condoms,” A said. Their stepfather stopped sexually abusing them when he found out the sisters were treated at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. One of his friends did not. The sisters fled to a domestic violence shelter when A found out she was pregnant, and managed from there to find abortion pills through a network of underground activists. “If I couldn’t have an abortion, I would have killed myself,” A said. “The man who raped me was a pig, and I did not want to have his baby inside of me.” Since Roe v Wade was overturned by the US supreme court in 2022, 14 states have passed near-total abortion bans. Ten of those states, including Texas, have no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest. A study published earlier this year estimated that 65,000 rape-related pregnancies probably occurred in states with abortion bans since Roe fell. While there are no studies on the numbers of rape-related pregnancies in minors since Roe was overturned, young people in states with abortion bans face unique barriers, according to doctors and advocates who spoke with the Guardian. “States that ban abortions, both with and without rape exceptions, do not have carve-outs for minors,” Dr Samuel Dickman, one of the authors of the study on rape-related pregnancies since Roe fell, said via email. “Many states where abortion care remains legal impose burdensome additional restrictions on abortion access for minors, such as parental consent or notification laws. And of course, the logistical and financial burdens on people trying to get abortions out of state are often worse for minors, who may not have access to transportation or the funds needed to travel and pay for abortion services.” Eleven states that have banned or restricted abortion since Roe v Wade fell have exceptions for rape and incest – but, as a recent analysis from KFF shows, they are often unworkable in practice due to a lack of abortion providers, requirements that survivors report the crime to police, and strict gestational limits. Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, singles out the law enforcement requirement as a particularly onerous barrier. It is well-known that survivors of rape often avoid going to the police out of fear of retribution or inaction; as the KFF study points out, an estimated 21% of sexual assaults are reported. “We know that sexual assault often goes unreported for various reasons; in states where abortion is banned and clinics have shuttered, everyone, including rape and incest survivors, will likely have to travel out of state to get care,” Smith said. When a minor child is a survivor of incest, it is often the primary caregiver – parent, step-parent or grandparent – that has raped them, Dr Peta-gay Ledbetter, a psychotherapist and former maternity nurse working with low-income populations in Texas, said. That makes it even less likely she or a relative will report the crime to law enforcement. Ledbetter said she had seen a 10-year old become pregnant after her mother’s boyfriend sexually assaulted her, with the mother’s knowledge. “Her little body was unable to carry the pregnancy, and she started to have a uterine rupture before the fetus was at a viable gestation.” The complications of preterm labor and uterine rupture necessitated a C-section to save the child’s life; the fetus did not survive. “An abortion would have saved this 10-year-old child great suffering and trauma for the rest of her life,” Ledbetter said. M, the activist who helped A get abortion pills, says that the minors she comes across seeking help have often resorted to unsafe measures to try to induce their own abortions. In 2023, she was contacted by another 16-year-old from Texas who got pregnant after a stranger raped her. “Like other girls I have met, she tried to overdose on borrowed medications,” M said. Forced to carry to term, she quit school and delivered a baby with a heart defect. M says she remains suicidal. “I’ve met at least three other girls who tried everything from drinking bottles of Nyquil and isopropyl alcohol, to taking Fentanyl,” M added. “One of my colleagues had to call the suicide hotline and poison control.” There is a dearth of literature on the mental health effects of pregnancies caused by rape, says Jennifer Toof, a trauma-informed psychologist based in Pennsylvania who is writing a book about the ethical responsibilities of mental health professionals post-Roe. “We know that rape and incest are significant risk factors for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health disorders, particularly for children, so having pre-existing trauma and mental health struggles on top of being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term when someone is still a child themselves is a dangerous combination.” A sprawling, underground network of activists is trying to fill the gap by providing women and girls with the means to end their pregnancies safely. According to M, who is not sharing her real name given the nature of her work, “we rely on a network of women who live in blue states to keep us ‘supplied’.” These activists often provide support beyond the pills themselves – M told the Guardian that they also provide funds and help minors travel for the care they need. Tightening restrictions The impact of abortion bans on young rape survivors came into national focus in 2022, when a 10-year-old girl from Ohio who was pregnant as the result of a rape was forced to travel to Indiana for an abortion, as her home state banned the procedure after six weeks. (Abortion rights have since been codified in Ohio’s constitution.) The Indiana doctor who performed the abortion, Caitlin Bernard, reported the procedure as required by state law, sparking a campaign against her by a group of anti-abortion activists and politicians. In another highly publicized case, in Mississippi, a 13-year-old girl who was raped by a stranger when she was 12 got pregnant and had to carry the baby to term because her family didn’t have the money to drive to the nearest abortion clinic in Chicago, or to pay for the procedure. While the child and her mother reported the rape to law enforcement, she was unable to terminate the pregnancy due to a lack of clarity around the exception. Today, she is raising the baby with the help of her family; her rapist was caught and charged. Some lawmakers have tried to introduce carve-outs to abortion bans for minors but have faced pushback in conservative states. In May 2024, a legislative committee in Louisiana rejected a bill that would have added cases of rape and incest as exceptions to Louisiana’s abortion ban. They also rejected an amendment brought by the Democratic state representative Delisha Boyd, which would have narrowed the bill to apply only to minors under the age of 17. Other states are seeking to make it even harder for children to access care. Laws in Idaho and Tennessee seek to punish any adult who helps a minor cross state lines for an abortion. Such laws are “falsely presented as ‘parents’ rights’ measures”, says Alison Brysk, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who researches the politics of abortion. “This means that the access to abortion for a child impregnated by parental abuse could depend upon the permission of the very person who abused them.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).

"abortion","Greens accuse Queensland Labor of ‘pure hypocrisy’ on abortion after Katter party election preferences","The Greens say Queensland Labor’s decision to direct preferences to Katter’s Australia Party candidates in north Queensland electorates is “absolute pure hypocrisy”, amid the ongoing debate over abortion laws. Robbie Katter, the KAP leader, has vowed to introduce a private member’s bill to wind back abortion rights and access, that would notionally spark a conscience vote. The prospect of a conscience vote has derailed the Liberal National party’s statewide campaign, as the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, and his candidates repeatedly refuse to detail their personal views, only repeating the party line that reform is “not part of our plans” and has been “ruled out”. Labor decriminalised abortion in 2018 and has sought to put the issue at the forefront of the campaign, saying there is a “very real risk” that reproductive rights will be wound back if the LNP wins government. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email On Tuesday the Greens said Labor should stop volunteers handing out how-to-vote cards in at least eight north and central Queensland electorates that direct preferences to the KAP. “It’s absolute pure hypocrisy for Labor to be talking about defending the right to choose while making it more likely that hard-right, anti-choice MPs get elected,” the Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy McMahon, said. “These are seats where the Katter party has a high chance of winning, Labor preferences could push them over the line in a race against the LNP.” The premier, Steven Miles, has said Labor MPs would also have a conscience vote on any abortion proposal, though the overwhelming majority are on the record supporting abortion rights. The Greens say they have “an ironclad guarantee” that all MPs would vote against re-criminalising abortion. “The Greens will protect abortion rights, and we’ll keep up the pressure on both parties to make sure access is rolled out through the public health system like Labor promised but which they haven’t delivered.” The deputy premier, Cameron Dick, dismissed the claim. “I don’t take political advice from the Queensland Greens political party,” he said. “I never have and I never will.” The Queensland election will be held on 26 October.","2024-10-15T01:30:46Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/15/queensland-state-election-abortion-policy-labor-lnp-robbie-katter"
"abortion","‘Standing up for Christian values’: US evangelicals keep the faith with Trump","When asked about Donald Trump’s Easter morning post wishing a happy holiday to “the Radical Left Lunatics … fighting and scheming so hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners” to the United States, Jackson Lahmeyer, an Oklahoma evangelical Christian pastor, said: “Isn’t it terrible that they are wanting to do that?” Lahmeyer, the founder of the Pastors for Trump organization, was not bothered by Trump’s extreme and divisive message on the Christian religious holiday, because, he said: “You cannot unify with evil.” Lahmeyer’s attitude appears typical of many white evangelical leaders who still strongly support Trump despite what – for many – is violent, extremist-laden language that many would see as unsuitable for any religious occasion, let alone one intimately connected to rebirth, forgiveness and peace. But those leaders in the US say Trump – unlike some past Republican presidents – has followed through on campaign promises concerning core issues such as abortion, immigration, the location of the US embassy in Israel and, more generally, his pledge to “bring back Christianity”. More good things could be in store for that demographic because in a second Easter post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said he would make America “more religious, than it has ever been before!!!” “He has moved the needle for the Christian agenda unlike anyone else, especially in modern times,” said Lahmeyer, who attended an Easter dinner at the White House. “As a pastor, obviously, that is music to my ears.” White evangelical voters also turned out in large numbers for George W Bush when he ran for president in 2000 and 2004, but they were disappointed because they felt he did not do enough to oppose same-sex marriage or to ban abortion. Bush also, when compared to Trump, had a more liberal immigration policy, including supporting providing undocumented immigrants the chance to become citizens, according to John Fea, a history professor at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and the author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump. “Bush wasn’t willing to give them everything that they wanted to be elected,” Fea said. “Trump will do what evangelicals tell him to do for the most part, in order to maintain power.” In addition to appointing supreme court justices who ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, Trump also moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which previous presidents had said they supported but did not implement. “They all said it to get votes. They never did it. The president did it,” said Lahmeyer, who ran for Senate and lost in 2022. During this term, Trump has signed executive orders to establish a faith office and a taskforce to address “anti-Christian bias” in the federal government. To evangelical leaders, that emphasis on Christian values stands in contrast to how they perceive the Biden administration’s actions, including in 2024 declaring 31 March Transgender Day of Visibility, the date when it had been celebrated since its creation in 2009, but last year fell – entirely coincidentally – on Easter Sunday. But in a world where conspiracy theories and misinformation is rife, that sparked anger among rightwing Christians. “Easter was barely mentioned,” said Brad Sherman, an Iowa pastor and Republican now running for governor. “In fact, I think it was more about some kind of LGBTQ awareness day or something, if I remember correctly, so I just feel like President Trump is standing up for Christian values.” In actual fact, Biden continued the tradition of the annual White House Easter egg roll and in a statement said: “As we gather with loved ones, we remember Jesus’s sacrifice … with wars and conflict taking a toll on innocent lives around the world, we renew our commitment to work for peace, security, and dignity for all people.” This year, Trump held an Easter prayer service and dinner with Lahmeyer; prominent pastors such as Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress; and his personal pastor, Paula White-Cain, who now leads the White House faith office, among others. “[Trump] preached the gospel to us pastors, and I thought that was amazing,” Lahmeyer said. While most white evangelicals support Trump, there are Christian leaders, including evangelicals, who have criticized some of the president’s policy decisions, especially to eliminate 83% of US Agency for International Development (USAID) programs. Among the initiatives affected was the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which has saved millions of lives from HIV/Aids and was popular with evangelicals. “We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment,” Emily Chambers Sharpe, the health director at World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, told the Guardian. But the person behind many of the federal government cuts, Elon Musk, head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, called USAID a “criminal organization” and said that it was “time for it to die”. Adam Russell Taylor, the president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice group, said such remarks remind him of “the prophet Isaiah, who forewarned us that woe to you that call evil, good, and good, evil”. The administration is “making these allegations that aren’t backed up by evidence or proof. And they disparage this whole body of work that has created such goodwill around the world and is so aligned with our Christian values,” Russell Taylor said. But many American evangelicals continue to support Trump despite such cuts, because concern for the poor “always takes a back seat in evangelical politics to abortion [and] control of the supreme court, which will allow them to have the religious freedom that they want”, said Fea, the history professor. Tony Suárez, the founder of Revivalmakers Ministries, an evangelical group, said he supports Trump because he is trying to strengthen border security and is restoring “respect for conservative, Judeo-Christian values”. Once the country secures the border and removes “the criminal element”, Suárez, who is also executive vice-president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said he would like to see a pathway to at least legal permanent residency for undocumented immigrants. He thinks that based on some of his comments during his first term, Trump would support that too. But Trump also wants to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents, a guarantee under the 14th amendment. Asked for his position on this, Suárez said that is “a little bit above me to understand what it is specifically that they are arguing”. And on cuts to foreign aid programs, Suárez said he views them “as difficult decisions that any organization, denomination, reformation, might have to take, and they will never be popular”. Suárez joked that the only thing he disagrees with Trump on is him saying that “you may even get tired of winning”. “I’m not tired,” Suárez said. “I’m looking for the next win.”","2025-04-28T11:00:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/28/trump-evangelicals-christians"
"abortion","Jacob Rees-Mogg on abortion, religion and reality TV: ‘I’ve been called worse than a Nazi’","Jacob Rees-Mogg’s townhouse is a stone’s throw from the Houses of Parliament. The family nanny, Veronica Crook, greets me with a smile. Crook was Rees-Mogg’s nanny from the day he was born and is now nanny to him and his six children. There is a huge, handsome portrait of her next to the kitchen. In the large room opposite, huge handsome portraits of family members and historical figures hang on the walls. It wouldn’t take long to work out who lives here if you were playing Through the Keyhole. The loo is plastered with newspaper cartoons about the former Conservative MP and minister, riffing on his scorn for civil servants, lockdown regulations and the EU. Then there are the cartoons celebrating his image as Mr Nasty: Rees-Mogg as a bespectacled cat saying: “I wouldn’t hurt a fly” while his left front paw pins down a petrified mouse; with a baby Boris Johnson in his arms, as a spitting Theresa May says: “Your daddy is a horrible person!” Rees-Mogg, 55, is famous for floccinaucinihilipilification – a word he introduced into parliamentary debate in 2012, meaning the act of considering something to be worthless. With Crook’s blessing, I head up the stairs to a large living room. Rees-Mogg enters – 6ft 2in, paper thin, owlish, with the air of a buoyant undertaker. As always, he is immaculately dressed: a perfectly pressed double-breasted suit, striped shirt, polka-dot tie. “Thank you for coming round. It’s rather chilly in here,” he says apologetically. Rees-Mogg is supremely polite in an old-fashioned way. He was known by some in parliament as the “honourable member for the 18th century”. But for all the politeness, at times he comes across as an unmannerly schoolboy. When he slouched across the frontbench as if bored senseless in a vital 2019 Brexit debate, the then Green MP Caroline Lucas accused him of showing contempt for parliament. Rees-Mogg lost his seat in July when his party was routed in the general election after 14 years in power. Now, he presents State of the Nation, a politics programme on GB News four nights a week. Perhaps more surprisingly, he and his family are starring in a five-part reality show, Meet the Rees-Moggs. As he sits down, so does the show’s publicist. I ask if she intends to stay for the whole interview. “Yes, it’s policy,” she says. “I’m just going to be listening in.” It’s funny that this intrepid champion of free speech is being chaperoned through our talk, not least when the nanny is downstairs. “Don’t worry,” he laughs. “Poppy’s not a spad who’s going to tell me what I’m meant to say.” Meet the Rees-Moggs follows him, his wife, Helena de Chair, and their six children – five sons and one daughter – in the final few weeks of the Tory administration, as it becomes clear that he is likely to lose his seat, despite a whopping majority of 14,729. One of his sons is bemused by the idea that his father could be unemployed. “I’ve never even heard of anyone losing their job, let alone someone in our family,” he says. His boys look like mini-Moggs. We see the family at home in their Somerset mansion, decked out in bow ties at formal suppers, attending the family chapel for Sunday mass, and playing cricket with their father. Rees-Mogg himself was a child TV star of sorts. The precocious son of the then Times editor, William Rees-Mogg, was filmed aged 12 for a documentary. He was shown being chauffeur-driven in a Rolls-Royce, suited and booted, attending the annual general meeting of the General Electric Company (GEC), which he already had shares in. He told the cameras that he hoped to be a millionaire by the age of 20, running GEC by 30 and prime minister by 70. He said he didn’t expect to get married because he had seen too many money-grubbing wives divorce their husbands and end up with half their money. When introducing de Chair at the start of each episode, a caption explains that she is heiress to a £45m fortune. To be fair, Rees-Mogg is also worth tens of millions thanks to the hedge fund business he co-founded, Somerset Capital Management (SCM). The couple’s wealth was estimated at “well over £100m” by Spear’s magazine in 2019, though profits halved at SCM in the year before it was wound down in 2023. Reality TV has boosted the careers of some of the politicians he most admires – notably Donald Trump on The Apprentice and Nigel Farage on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! How did Meet the Rees-Moggs come about? He says he got an email from out of the blue asking if he fancied making a show. “To be perfectly honest, my first thought was that it was a spooooof. Why would anyone want to do this?” Rees-Mogg has a particular way of speaking – chewing on each syllable like a toffee, words randomly stretched with relish. So what convinced him to do it? “To get your message across as a politician you have to be known, and I was quite impressed by the success Nigel Farage had going into the jungle. Now I wouldn’t go into the jungle in a million years. I like my creature comforts too much … So this in a way is my version of the jungle.” And the Kardashians? “Well, I wouldn’t go that far! It’s more like At Home With the Furys, in that Mrs Fury comes across wonderfully. Helena is my Mrs Fury and I’m the grumpy one in the background.” You’re Tyson Fury? “Well, I wouldn’t compare myself to Mr Fury, who has attributes that I couldn’t begin to match up to.” I ask him if there was anything he wouldn’t allow to be shown. “I was very clear from the beginning I wasn’t going to be filmed in a state of undress.” Was he worried about exposing his children? After all, he’s previously said that his oldest son, Peter, 17, received hate mail because he was a Rees-Mogg. “I obviously thought carefully about the children and discussed it with Helena. The basic conclusion is that because our surname is relatively unusual, when people hear their name the children are tarred by my brush, so to speak, and therefore this doesn’t particularly make it any better or any worse.” Did you ask them if they wanted to be part of it? “I did speak to the children. They thought it was quite a good idea and Mary [his teenage daughter] was particularly keen on it.” Why? “She thought it would be fun! And it has been fun.” Mary is eloquent and uninhibited in front of the cameras, talking about how the mother of a fellow pupil told her daughter that Rees-Mogg hates foreigners. Well, he says, that’s the price they pay for being his progeny. “Even the Rees-Mogg nieces and nephews have people be randomly rude to them because they’re called Rees-Mogg. That’s a little bit unfair. They can’t be held responsible for their uncle. So that is part of public life. And in a way, when it came to doing this, it was too late. That was already the situation, and I didn’t think this would make it any better or any worse.” Maybe. Keir Starmer, whom Rees-Mogg sarcastically refers to as the Reverend, is ferociously protective of his children’s privacy. What did he say to Mary when she was told that he hates foreigners? “Well, it’s simply not true. I want immigration to be controlled and these are two totally different concepts. I’ve always explained and discussed politics with my children. Probably, I have no other conversation so there’s nothing else I can talk to them about.” It’s not strictly true when Rees-Mogg says he has no subject but politics. It emerges in the show that he is even more doctrinaire about his Roman Catholicism. I tell him I find it hard to reconcile his religion with his free-market absolutism and obsession with money. As a 12-year-old, he talked about how he loved money just for the sake of it. I quote Matthew 6:24. “You cannot serve both God and money.” He smiles and throws another quote back at me. “And the love of money is also the root of all evil. Yup. But there is also: ‘Wine maketh merry but money cureth all things.’ The devil can quote scripture. I hadn’t thought about it in those terms, but certainly I would say that faith is more important to me now than it was, and in relation to money that faith is ultimately important and money is just a means to an end in this life.” How does he spend his money? Another smile. “School fees! Plus 20% VAT.” Meet the Rees-Moggs repeatedly tells us that he is one of the most divisive politicians in the country. One of his most controversial positions is on abortion, which he has called “morally indefensible”. His opposition to it even applies for pregnancies as a result of rape or incest. “I accept the teaching of the church,” he says. “At the point of which life begins, and the question is whether it’s right to take life, and it’s the importance of the second life. There are two lives, not one to be considered.” He is also vehemently opposed to gay marriage. When asked about it previously, he said: “I take the teaching of the Catholic church seriously. Marriage is a sacrament and the view of what marriage is is taken by the church, not parliament.” Another Roman Catholic view is that sex should wait until after marriage. Can I ask a personal question, I say? “You can ask any question – I may not answer it!’ Well, I say, I’ve been thinking about the fundamentalism of your Catholicism and how deep it goes. I wonder if you were a virgin when you married? His voice rises. “I’m not going to go into personal details of that kind.” I’m asking, I say, because we’re talking about the core tenets of Catholicism and how they impact your political views. “I’m not going to hold myself up as somebody of utter moral rectitude,” he says. “But such sins as I have committed are a matter between me and my father confessor.” Is he opposed to contraception? “I, I, I, certainly,” he stammers bashfully. “Let’s move on from there,” Poppy says. I think it’s an important question, I say. Poppy gives me a look. “We don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable,” she says. Now he comes to my defence. “Nononono, you’re free to ask questions. The teaching of the church is set out in Humanae Vitae, the encyclical of Pope Paul VI. And I accept the church’s teaching on contraception. But I don’t think this is a matter for legislation. This is a matter of private morality rather than public morality.” We change the subject. You pride yourself on your truthfulness, I say. “Well, I certainly try.” And truth is obviously an important tenet in any religion. He nods. How do you accommodate that with the fact that two of your favourite contemporary politicians, Trump and Johnson, are known as liars? “OK. Donald Trump says things that are obviously inaccurate.” That’s a kind word for it, I say. “I use the word deliberately,” he says. “But I don’t think anybody thinks they are accurate when he says them. And I think that’s important.” Ideologically, he and Trump have a lot in common. Do you see anything of him in you? “Nononoono, other than we’ve both been called Nazis by David Lammy. I think that’s the one point we have in common. I was actually called worse than a Nazi.” This was in 2019, after Rees-Mogg tweeted a video of a speech by a senior member of Germany’s far-right AfD party. And Johnson? “Boris in my opinion is a truthful man. He inevitably says things that are spun. All politicians do that. Even I do that. You want to put your policy and views in the best possible light. But if you take the Partygate thing, Boris told the truth. I think the whole Partygate thing is ridiculous. I don’t think Boris lied or misled the House of Commons.” The 2023 report by the privileges committee found that Johnson deliberately misled parliament over Partygate and was part of a campaign to abuse and intimidate MPs investigating him. Have any of his children rebelled against his beliefs? “Are they broadly sympathetic to Conservatism and Catholicism at the moment? Yes, they are.” Would it bother him if they weren’t? “I’d be happier if they changed politics than they changed religion. Religion is fundamentally more important. I would be more concerned about that.” In the show, Rees-Mogg says that, after the general election defeat, it’s time to reflect and people won’t want to hear from the Tories for a while. But now he’s more positive, not least because of Trump’s victory in the US. “It’s very important,” he says. Why? “Because he is challenging the liberal orthodoxy. He’s challenging it on net zero, which is tremendously important.” Rees-Mogg believes that Britain’s net zero aspirations are destroying the economy. He’s even got a kind word for the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. “I think Kemi’s very impressive.” Would he like to see Farage’s Reform and the Tories join forces? “It’s very early days, but the Conservative party and Reform need to come to an accommodation. Nigel is a phenomenal politician. He manages to pick up issues that other people aren’t looking at, and he connects with voters, but I don’t think Nigel can win on his own.” Does he envy Farage’s qualities?” He throws his head back. “Ha! Envy is one of the seven deadly sins. No! But I admire the qualities Nigel has.” As for Johnson, of course, he’s not ruling out another comeback. But, he says, he’s given up on his own dream of leading the country. “As a 12-year-old, one says all sorts of things that no longer apply. I’m not going to be the prime minister, I’m not even in parliament.” Would he like to return? “Yes, I love being involved in politics.” And does he think Meet the Rees-Moggs could be a good platform for his return? “That’s absolutely right. But it’s a risk.” I ask if he’s learned anything about himself from making the show. “That’s a difficult question,” he says. He thinks and thinks. Nothing comes to mind. Has he seen himself in a different light? “Not really, no.” And then an epiphany. “Perhaps one exception actually. When Sara, who helps out in the house, says the first time she saw me she didn’t know what to say, or something like that …” She said she was terrified of you, I offer. “That’s right, that’s right. And that surprises me greatly because I must confess I do not consider myself as a particularly terrifying person.” • Meet the Rees-Moggs streams on discovery+ from 2 December","2024-11-18T05:00:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/18/jacob-rees-mogg-on-abortion-religion-and-reality-tv-ive-been-called-worse-than-a-nazi"
"abortion","UK business secretary denies free speech issue featured in US tariff talks","The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has denied that the issue of free speech has featured in tariff negotiations with the US after reports a deal could be jeopardised by the outcome of a criminal case in Dorset. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), an office within the US Department of State, has met the anti-abortion campaigner Livia Tossici-Bolt, who was prosecuted for an alleged breach of a buffer zone outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic. The verdict is due on Friday following a trial at Poole magistrates court. In a statement after the meeting, posted on X, the bureau said: “US-UK relations share a mutual respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, as Vice President JD Vance has said, we are concerned about freedom of expression in the United Kingdom.” It added: “We are monitoring her case. It is important that the UK respect and protect freedom of expression.” The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday quoted an unnamed US source who the paper said was familiar with trade negotiations as warning there would be “no free trade without free speech”, when asked about the DRL comments. When asked about the reports, Reynolds, who heads the Department for Business and Trade, said free speech had not formed part of the trade negotiations in which he had been involved. He told Times Radio: “Obviously, there are things from different people in the administration that they’ve said in the past about this, but it’s not been part of the trade negotiations that I’ve been part of.” He later added on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that free speech had not been a “material factor” in negotiations and the concerns were coming from the US state department rather than the US commerce department, which leads on trade. Keir Starmer said it was likely that Donald Trump’s tariffs would hit the UK but said the government was working on a deal to mitigate the effects. The prime minister told Sky News on Tuesday: “The likelihood is there will be tariffs. Nobody welcomes that. We are obviously working with the sectors most impacted at pace on that. Nobody wants to see a trade war but I have to act in the national interests.” That meant “all options remain on the table” in response, he added. “We are of course negotiating an economic deal which will, I hope mitigate the tariffs,” Starmer said. Asked if he had been “played” by the US president, who is set to hit the UK with tariffs despite Starmer’s efforts, he said: “The US is our closest ally. Our defence, our security, our intelligence are bound up in a way that no two other countries are. “So it’s obviously in our national interest to have a close working relationship with the US, which we’ve had for decades, and I want to ensure we have for decades to come.” He said talks on an economic deal would normally take “months or years” but “in a matter of weeks we have got well advanced in those discussions”. Downing Street would not comment on Tossici-Bolt’s case. But in relation to measures announced under the last government the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “The government’s clear that it’s vital that a woman who decides to use abortion services has the right to choose to do so without being subject to harassment or distress, and that’s why the previous government announced rules around that.”","2025-04-01T12:43:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/01/uk-business-secretary-denies-free-speech-issue-featured-in-us-tariff-talks"
"abortion","Anti-abortion groups warn Trump’s row back on position risks losing votes","Over the last two weeks, Donald Trump has publicly backed away from multiple anti-abortion positions – a move that Democrats see as hypocritical and that, anti-abortion activists warn, risks alienating voters who have long stood by him. On Thursday, Trump said that, if elected, he would make the government or insurance companies cover in vitro fertilization – a type of fertility assistancethat some in the anti-abortion movement want to see curtailed. Trump also seemed to indicate that he planned to vote in favor of a ballot measure to restore abortion access in Florida, which currently bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” Trump told NBC News in an interview. Trump’s campaign quickly rushed to walk back his remarks on the ballot measure, telling NPR that Trump simply meant that six weeks is too early in pregnancy to ban abortion. “President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida,” his press secretary said. On Friday, in comments to Fox News, Trump also clarified his position on a Florida amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution and overturn the six-week abortion ban, saying he would vote against it. The Republican candidate had previously told NBC News that the six-week window is “too short”, sparking confusion about his stance. “I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks,” Trump said Friday, but added: “At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month … So I’ll be voting no for that reason.” Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, in a decision backed by three justices that the former president appointed, Trump has alternately bragged about toppling Roe and complained that outrage over its fall will cost Republicans elections. But Trump’s comments on Thursday mark his latest attempt to apparently clarify and soften his stance on the controversial procedure. Last week, Trump also suggested that he would not use a 19th century anti-vice law to ban abortion nationwide, while his running mate, JD Vance, said the Republican presidential nominee would not sign a national ban. “I don’t think it tells us necessarily what Trump is or isn’t going to do, because he’s still been leaving himself wiggle room on a lot of critical questions,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis school of law who studies the legal history of reproduction. But, she continued: “What had been a strategy of ‘be ambiguous and then hopefully be everything to everyone’ has tilted more in the direction of Trump trying to assure voters that he doesn’t agree with the anti-abortion movement.” Trump’s new strategy comes as Kamala Harris, a far more effective champion of abortion rights than Joe Biden, has taken over as the Democratic nominee for president, and as polls show the two candidates are neck and neck. But this strategy may leave anti-abortion voters feeling less energized to vote for him, warned Kristan Hawkins, president of the prominent anti-abortion group Students for Life of America. “The pro-life movement didn’t always have a firm place in the Republican party. For many years, we were at the little kids’ table,” Hawkins said. “The young people that we work with, they don’t remember that. And so they’re absolutely shocked and saddened to see someone who they thought was pro-life, or who had always reaffirmed pro-life values, walking back on that.” Although the anti-abortion movement was a critical component of Trump’s success in the 2016 presidential election, Republicans have tried to back away from it in the years since Roe’s demise as abortion rights supporters have repeatedly won ballot measures even in red states. Sixty per cent of American adults believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 70% say access to IVF is a “good thing”. Tresa Undem, who has polled people on abortion for more than 20 years, does not think that Trump’s comments will necessarily win him the support of uncertain or independent voters who support abortion rights. Instead, he may be trying to reassure the segment of his base that also supports access to the procedure. “A third of his voters are pro-choice,” Undem said. “In a recent survey we did, 16% of 2020 Trump voters say abortion rights are a top five issue. So when you have an election that is probably going to be determined based on 1% of people, 16% of Trump voters saying their abortion rights is top in their mind – that’s a problem for him.” Democrats have cast Trump’s new strategy, particularly his comments on IVF, as a sham. In a Friday press call organized by the Harris campaign, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, repeatedly pointed out that Vance had voted against a Senate bill to create federal protections for IVF. “Trump that thinks women are stupid and that we can be gaslighted,” Warren said. “He seems to believe he can do one thing when he talks to his extremist base and then turn around and smile at the overwhelming majority of Americans who want to see access to abortion and IVF protected.” On Friday, the DNC is rolling out billboards in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state, that slam Trump over IVF, according to a strategy shared exclusively with the Guardian. “Trump overturned Roe, threatening the future of IVF,” one billboard reads. Another says: “Donald Trump’s Project 2025 Undermines Reproductive Care and Threatens IVF.” Project 2025, a playbook of conservative policies drawn up by the influential Heritage Foundation, contains a long list of anti-abortion proposals. Trump has tried to distance himself from it over the last several weeks. At least one prominent anti-abortion activist, Lila Rose, has publicly declared she currently does not plan to vote for Trump, given his recent turn away from anti-abortion positions. But Hawkins is still committed to getting people to vote for Trump – not because of Trump himself, but because she fears how a Harris presidency would strengthen abortion access. “I don’t like it. It’s not where I think we should be as a nation, but I think that we’ve had to do this at times within the pro-life movement,” she said. “Folks are asked: if you can’t vote for a candidate, vote against the worst one.” What Hawkins is less sure of is whether Trump’s comments will affect Students for Life’s get out the vote program for the 2024 election. “I think it remains to be seen whether or not we’re also talking about Donald Trump at the doors,” she said.","2024-08-30T17:54:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/30/trump-ivf-anti-abortion-groups"
"abortion","Battle over abortion rights in South Dakota constitution intensifies","Anti-abortion activists in South Dakota have sued over a ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, leading the group behind the measure to ask a federal judge to step in and block the activists’ effort. Last week, South Dakota’s Life Defense Fund filed a lawsuit accusing Dakotans for Health of fraud, turning in invalid signatures and failing to abide by the state rules that govern signature-gathering for ballot measures. Life Defense Fund has asked a South Dakota circuit court to take the abortion-rights measure off the November ballot. In response, Dakotans for Health on Tuesday filed a motion in federal court arguing that Life Defense Fund’s argument is faulty, because it relies on a law that has been blocked by a separate court order. Life Defense Fund “are wrong on the facts and wrong on the law,” Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, said in a statement. “They aren’t even aware that the law they are trying to use to claim our petition should be invalidated was itself invalidated over a year and half ago and no longer exists.” “We’re reviewing the complaint, and we will continue to fight to protect mothers and babies from the atrocities of abortion in our state,” Jon Hansen, co-chair of Life Defense Fund and a Republican South Dakota state legislator, said in a statement. Currently, South Dakota bans abortion except in cases of medical emergencies. The ballot measure would restore the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy, as well as require that “regulation of a pregnant woman’s abortion decision, or of an abortion, during the second trimester must be reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman”. South Dakota would still be allowed to ban abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy, unless a doctor decides that an abortion is necessary to protect a patient’s life or health. Dakotans for Health turned in more than 50,000 signatures in support of putting the measure on the ballot. The lawsuit is only the latest effort to stop the state’s ballot measure from moving forward. In March, the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, signed into law a bill that would allow people to remove their signatures from ballot measure petitions, a move widely seen as an attack on the abortion-rights measure, which had not yet qualified for the ballot. Then, in May, the South Dakota secretary of state, Monae L Johnson, released a statement warning voters about “scammers” calling people and, while pretending to be officials from Johnson’s office, urging them to take their names off petitions supporting the abortion-rights ballot measure. South Dakota is one of at least three states where residents will be able to vote directly on whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Similar ballot measures are still pending in several other states, including electoral battlegrounds like Arizona and Nevada.","2024-06-18T21:56:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/18/abortion-rights-south-dakota-lawsuit"
"abortion","University of Kentucky athlete charged after dead infant found hidden in closet","A University of Kentucky athlete allegedly placed her dead infant inside a trash bag later found in a closet while trying to hide the baby’s birth, leading to her being jailed, according to local authorities and media reporting. Laken Ashlee Snelling, 21, faces charges of corpse abuse, tampering with physical evidence and concealing the birth of an infant after her arrest on Sunday, police in Lexington, Kentucky, said in a statement. Snelling had been a member of the University of Kentucky’s competitive cheer stunt squad for the past three seasons, the school told the local news station WLEX in a statement. Her arrest citation, which was obtained and reviewed by WLEX, says police were called out to Snelling’s home on 27 August to investigate a report of “a deceased infant being located inside … a closet”. The baby was “wrapped in a towel inside … a black trash bag”, prompting police to read Snelling her Miranda rights as well as interrogate her, the citation said. The citation added that Snelling admitted to investigators that she had given birth to the child and then tried to conceal that by “cleaning any evidence, placing all cleaning items used inside of a black trash bag, including the infant”. The local coroner’s office later said an autopsy conducted on the infant yielded inconclusive findings about the baby’s cause of death, and more tests would be needed. Snelling by Tuesday had been released from jail on a bond of $100,000. She pleaded not guilty at a preliminary court appearance on Tuesday and was ordered to live with her parents, WLEX reported. Her next court hearing was tentatively set for 26 September. Information on Kentucky athletics’ website described Snelling as a native of White Pine, Tennessee. The more serious charges against Snelling are corpse abuse and tampering with physical evidence. Under Kentucky state law, both are considered class D felonies, meaning people convicted of those crimes in particular could receive between one and five years in prison as well as a fine of up to $10,000. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, multiple women have faced criminal charges after suffering miscarriages, sparking fears among experts and women that pregnancy losses may now be treated like crime scenes. It was not clear on Tuesday if Snelling gave birth, suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth, or underwent a self-managed abortion. It is legal in most states, including Kentucky, to self-manage your own abortion.","2025-09-02T17:25:59Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/university-kentucky-cheer-charged-dead-infant-closet"
"abortion","‘Women are not stupid’: Warren dismisses Vance’s promise on abortion ban veto","Elizabeth Warren says “American women are not stupid” and therefore do not believe JD Vance’s promise that Donald Trump would veto any nationwide abortion ban passed by Congress if the Republican presidential ticket wins November’s election. “American women are not stupid, and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” Warren said on Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. The Democratic US senator from Massachusetts added that she suspects conservative activists could use the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-obscenity law which bans mailing abortion-related materials, to enforce a federal ban on abortion if the former president clinches a second presidency with Vance as his running mate. She said it would not be all that “hard to accomplish” with “the right person [in] the Department of Justice and one of their extremist judges out in the world”. “Understand this: today 30% of all women live in states that effectively ban abortion,” Warren said, referring to how 14 US states have enacted near-total bans on the procedure since the 2022 US supreme court ruling that eliminated federal abortion rights. “Donald Trump and JD Vance in the White House – it won’t be 30%. It’ll be 100%.” Warren’s remarks came in response to a separate Meet the Press interview with Vance in which he was asked whether Trump, if elected again to the Oval Office, would use the presidency’s veto powers overrule a congressional federal abortion ban. “I think he would,” Vance told Meet the Press host Kristen Welker in a pre-recorded clip which the show began promoting on Saturday. “He said … explicitly that he would.” Trump himself pledged in April that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law, with polling showing a clear majority of Americans favor abortion being legal in all or most cases. But Democrats maintain that he is lying. They point out that Trump has spoken proudly of his three supreme court appointees who formed part of the conservative majority that dissolved the federal abortion rights previously established by the Roe v Wade decision in 1973. And they note how the 900-page Project 2025 plan drafted by a conservative thinktank that supports Trump calls for the Food and Drug Administration to completely revoke its approval of the abortion medication mifepristone. Project 2025 also discusses using the Comstock Act to criminally prosecute people who send abortion pills or tools through the mail. Vance in 2023 joined 40 of his fellow Republican lawmakers calling on US justice department prosecutors to investigate pursuing physicians, pharmacists and others “who break the federal mail-order abortion laws”. In June, Warren – a 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate – helped introduce legislation aiming to repeal the Comstock Act. It has not garnered the 60 votes necessary to advance bills in the Senate. But part of the proposed bill’s strategy was to raise awareness of the Comstock Act’s consequences for the 168 million women living in the US – a country of 333 million. According to Warren on Sunday, the only way to protect abortion access in the US was to elect the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, over Trump – as well as a Congress with a clear liberal majority that would pass laws enshrining the right to access abortion-related care nationwide. “She will sign it into law,” Warren said. “And then we will restore a right to half the population in this country.” • The headline and introduction of this article were amended on 27 and 29 August 2024 to more accurately reflect Elizabeth Warren’s quote.","2024-08-26T10:00:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/elizabeth-warren-jd-vance-nationwide-abortion-ban-veto"
"abortion","‘A Trojan horse’: how the right is using ‘parental rights’ to fight abortion ballot measures","A Maryland ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution is, a Maryland activist claims, a “Trojan horse to trick pro-choice Marylanders into voting away parental rights”. Opponents of a New York referendum, which is meant to cement protections for abortion rights, have started calling it the “Parent Replacement Act” and claim it would expand rights for transgender minors. Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, has said that his state’s ballot measure would “mandate constitutionally, all reproductive health services, and that includes transgender treatments for minors”. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, support for abortion rights has soared. Seven states have voted on abortion-related ballot measures, and in every state, voters have sided with supporters of the procedure, including in deep-red states like Kentucky and Ohio. Now, in the run-up to election day, 10 states are set to vote on their own abortion measures – and anti-abortion activists across the country are trying to disrupt that streak using the specter of “parental rights”. These measures, they say, could strip parents of their right to make decisions for their children – an argument that, in the years since the Covid pandemic broke out, has become an increasingly potent weapon in US culture wars. Legal experts say these claims are overblown. “It’s a vast oversimplification of what’s happening,” said Nicole Huberfeld, a professor who leads the Boston University School of Law’s reproductive law program. More than 30 states say minors cannot obtain an abortion without notifying a parent or obtaining their consent. If a state with such a law – called a “parental involvement law” – passes a measure expanding abortion rights, the law would not immediately be struck down, according to Huberfeld. Instead, a court would need to rule on the issue. And, although the exact wording of each measure would ultimately determine how it was interpreted, Huberfeld said: “I don’t see these issues as being real issues.” She continued: “They are fear and confusion campaigns. There are efforts to try to confuse the people who will be voting on these ballot initiatives, to make it so that they don’t understand what they’re voting on.” Meanwhile, because some forms of gender-affirming care can affect people’s ability to reproduce, opponents have suggested that measures to protect reproductive healthcare would also protect minors’ access to gender-affirming care. But experts say that it has not been firmly established that gender-affirming care legally falls under the banner of reproductive health. “Even if you accept that it could have this wild, expansive meaning, there still are ways within the text of the amendment that allow the government to pass laws around this topic,” one law professor told the Missouri Independent after Hawley’s comments. Nevertheless, touting these claims has become a go-to strategy in the anti-abortion playbook. Michigan and Ohio, which respectively passed abortion-related ballot measures in 2022 and 2023, were both hit with messaging around parental rights and warnings from anti-abortion activists that the measures would erase parental involvement laws around abortion and gender-affirming care. Both states still require minors to obtain consent from their parents before undergoing an abortion. And while Michigan permits gender-affirming care for minors – and did so before the ballot measure passed – a judge recently upheld Ohio’s ban on it. Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is backing abortion-rights measures in several states, believes claims about parental rights are a calculated distraction. “It does reveal that our opponents really do understand that the electorate is not with them on the core, fundamental issue of abortion,” Hall said. “There’s no other reason they would be trying to change the subject so dramatically.” ‘Florida invented this playbook’ The most heated and high-profile abortion-related measure of the election is playing out in Florida, which currently bans the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy – and is arguably the headquarters of the modern-day parental rights movement. “Amendment 4 would remove the requirement for parental consent for minors seeking an abortion,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, posted on X last week. “Amendment 4 would undermine the foundation of parental rights in Florida.” He also shared an ad featuring Dr Grazie Christie, a radiologist, calling Amendment 4 “too extreme and not what it seems”. In the ad, Christie says: “Amendment 4 would make abortion the only medical procedure a minor could undergo without parental consent.” Since the pandemic ignited debates around Covid safety measures in schools, the idea of parental rights has become a rallying cry among activists who claim government institutions are intruding on parents’ rights to make decisions for their children. Moms for Liberty, the far-right group that advocates for book bans and limiting discussions about race and LGBTQ+ identities, calls Florida home. The state also passed the nation’s first “don’t say gay” bill, which aims to block teachers from speaking about sexual orientation and gender identity. (A settlement later allowed teachers to talk about these topics as long as the discussion is not part of formal instruction.) Now, Florida is a battlefield over Amendment 4, which would roll back the state’s six-week abortion ban. More than $70m has been poured into the fight over the amendment, which needs to garner 60% of the vote to pass – a threshold that no post-Roe abortion-related ballot measure has met. “Florida did invent this playbook, and I’m hoping that this is a time where we get to put this playbook to bed,” said Lauren Brenzel, the campaign director of Floridians Protecting Freedom, the coalition spearheading the campaign for the amendment. Floridians Protecting Freedom has sued Florida officials at least twice – once for attempting to block a TV ad in support of abortion rights and once over a state-run website that suggested that, among other things, Amendment 4 could “open discussions about the role of parental involvement in a minor’s decision to have an abortion”. Aaron Bos-Lun, the Florida-based deputy executive director of the abortion-rights group Men4Choice, said he had recently been barraged by anti-abortion ads that talk about Amendment 4 and its alleged impact on Florida’s parental consent law requirements. “When we canvass, when we talk with voters – whether that’s on the phones or at the doors – there’s definitely been an uptick of people who have heard some piece of misinformation about the ballot initiative,” Bos-Lun said. Parental involvement laws involving abortion have long been popular with American voters. In 2022, 70% of Americans said they supported laws requiring minors to notify their parents about their decisions to get abortions, including 57% of self-identified Democrats, the Pew Research Center found. Even since Roe fell, boosting support for abortion rights, activists have struggled to get even their allies in state legislatures to consider repealing them. Amendment 4 explicitly declares that it “does not change the legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion”. Anti-abortion activists claim the amendment would permit Florida minors to only notify their parents that they want an abortion, not to obtain their consent, as Florida law currently requires. But Floridians Protecting Freedom says the amendment does not aim to change Florida’s parental consent law. Louis Virelli, a professor of constitutional law at Florida’s Stetson University College of Law, agreed. “Amendment 4 leaves enough space for courts to say: ‘Yes, legislature, you can regulate parental consent.’ That is a certainty,” Virelli said. “There is no good-faith argument that says it absolutely, unequivocally prohibits them.” With parental rights being invoked in some of the United States’ biggest culture-war issues – abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, vaccines – Huberfeld sees a clear through-line. “This is a new tool in the toolbox of anti-medicine, anti-public health campaigns,” Huberfeld said. “This is just another feature of how that’s playing out.”","2024-10-28T11:00:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/abortion-rights-parental-rights"
"abortion","Judge orders Trump administration to continue Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood","The Trump administration must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics for Medicaid-funded services, a federal judge ruled on Monday, in an escalating legal war between the reproductive health giant and the White House over Republican efforts to “defund” Planned Parenthood. Days after Donald Trump signed his sweeping tax bill, Planned Parenthood sued over a provision in the bill that ended Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, such as Planned Parenthood. The new court order, from US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston, will protect Medicaid funding for all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide while litigation in the case continues. The order also replaces and expands a previous edict handed down by Talwani, which initially granted a preliminary injunction specifically blocking the government from cutting Medicaid payments only to Planned Parenthood affiliates that did not provide abortions or did not receive at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year. “Patients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable,” Talwani wrote in her Monday order. “In particular, restricting members’ ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs.” More than 80 million people rely on Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. It is already illegal to use Medicaid to pay for most abortions, but Planned Parenthood clinics – which treat a disproportionate number of people who use Medicaid – rely on the program to reimburse it for services such as birth control, STI tests and cancer screenings. In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood had argued that it would be at risk of closing nearly 200 clinics in 24 states if it is cut off from Medicaid funds. These closures would probably be felt most strongly in blue states, since they are home to larger numbers of people who use Medicaid. A Planned Parenthood affiliate in California has already been forced to close five clinics as a result of the “defunding” provision. Planned Parenthood estimated that, in all, more than 1 million patients could lose care. “We will keep fighting this cruel law so that everyone can get birth control, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other critical healthcare, no matter their insurance,” the Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s president and CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, said in a statement after the Monday ruling. Planned Parenthood is battling overwhelming political and economic headwinds. Even if it prevails against the Trump administration, its affiliates could still be removed from Medicaid in red states, thanks to a June decision by the US supreme court in favor of South Carolina in a case involving the state’s attempt to kick Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program. On Monday, the state of Missouri also sued the Planned Parenthood Federation of America – the mothership organization that knits together Planned Parenthood’s network of regional affiliates – over accusations that the organization downplayed the medical risks of a common abortion pill, mifepristone, “to cut costs and boost revenue”. The lawsuit, which asks for more than $1m in damages, is part of an ongoing campaign by anti-abortion activists to cut off access to mifepristone. More than 100 studies, conducted across dozens of countries and over more than three decades, have concluded that mifepristone is a safe way to end a pregnancy.

"abortion","Beyoncé brings star power to Harris rally in Texas with abortion law in the spotlight","Beyoncé lent her star power to Kamala Harris at a high-octane rally in Texas on Friday, declaring that the America was on the “brink of history” as the vice-president warned the state’s near-total abortion ban could become the law of the land if Donald Trump is elected. “For all the men and women in this room, and watching around the country, we need you,” Beyoncé told a roaring crowd of 30,000 people at the open-air Shell Energy stadium in her native Houston. With the presidential race effectively deadlocked, Harris detoured briefly from the seven battleground states to appear in deep-red Texas. Here in a place she called “ground zero for the fight for reproductive freedom”, Harris sought to lay out the stakes in November for voters who have yet to make up their minds about the candidates – or whether to cast a ballot at all. “Let us be clear: If Donald Trump wins again, he will ban abortion nationwide,” Harris told the audience, her largest to date. She walked on to the stage, as she has ever since she became the presumptive nominee roughly 100 days ago, to Beyoncé’s hard-charging anthem, Freedom. Harris has framed her campaign on the theme of freedom, painting Trump as a threat to hard-won progress advancing personal liberties and to American democracy itself. Earlier this week, Harris agreed that Trump was a “fascist”. The crowd that turned out for Harris on Friday night was exuberant. Thousands lined up for hours in the sticky Houston heat to attend. Rally-goers wore flashing wristbands in all different colors added to the concert-like atmosphere. A group of women in cowboy hats and boots danced and sang as a DJ spun pop ballads before the event began. But the message Harris came to deliver was sobering. In her remarks, she detailed the cascading effects of abortion bans like the one in Texas, which prohibits physicians from performing abortions after cardiac activity is detected, as early as six weeks. Doctors were being driven out of states, leaving women, particularly in the south, with fewer healthcare options. But it wasn’t just Republican-led states at risk, she said, warning that a second Trump administration would seek to outlaw abortion in every state, even New York, Michigan and California, where it legal. “All that to say, elections matter,” she said. Despite the speculation, the megastar did not perform, but she did offer her endorsement of Harris, a woman “standing in her power”. “I’m here as a mother,” Beyoncé said. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children, and all of our children, live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies.” In the final days before the election, the Harris campaign is tapping the star power of the party’s most popular figures and celebrity supporters. On Friday night, Willie Nelson, the country music star who was introduced as a “Texas voter”, performed a handful of his best-known songs, including On the Road Again and actor Jessica Alba urged women to vote. Beyoncé was joined by her mother, Tina Knowles, and her former bandmate Kelly Rowland, who gave a rousing call to action on Harris’s behalf. “We are grabbing back the pen from those who are trying to write an American story that would deny the right for women to make our own decisions about our bodies,” Rowland said. “Today that means grabbing that pen and casting my vote for Kamala Harris.” The night before, Harris held her first campaign event with Barack Obama. They were joined onstage in Atlanta by rocker Bruce Springsteen, who played a three-song set and branded Trump an “American tyrant.” On Saturday, Harris will rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan. Trump was also in Texas on Friday, where he taped a lengthy podcast interview with Joe Rogan. And, at an earlier stop, he repeated his assertion that migration had turned the US into a “garbage can for the world”. Before sitting for her own podcast interview with vulnerability researcher Brené Brown, Harris responded to Trump’s remark, calling it “another example of how he really belittles our country”. Harris does not expect to win Texas. But Democrats here are suddenly hopeful after polls suggest an unexpectedly close senate race between the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, and the Democrat, Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred. Senate Democrats face a daunting map this cycle. With a loss in West Virginia all but certain, and Montana slipping away, their hopes of maintaining narrow-control of the chamber increasingly rest on an upset in the Lone Star state. In his remarks, Allred taunted his opponent for supporting Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which led to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, and for fleeing to Cancún, Mexico, during a winter storm that devastated the state. “Everything is bigger in Texas. But Ted Cruz is too small for Texas,” Allred said, holding his hand low for emphasis. The emotional heart of the evening was the personal stories of Texas women who had nearly died from pregnancy-related complications because they did not receive proper care. Ondrea Cummings, a Texas woman who appeared in a new Harris campaign, became emotional as she shared her harrowing experience after a miscarriage at 16 weeks and needing an emergency abortion that she was denied under the state’s law. A video played before her remarks showed her with a wound and scars that stretched down her body, from her breast to her pelvis, after a six-hour surgery in which she said doctors had to cut open her torso in order to save her life. “Texas’ abortion bans unleashed by Donald Trump almost cost me my life and have left me with physical and emotional scars,” she said. Amanda and Josh Zurawski, residents of Austin, Texas, also shared their story. At 18 weeks pregnant with a girl she planned to name Willow, Amanda Zurawski began to suffer complications and needed an abortion. There was no chance the fetus would survive, but doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy until she eventually developed sepsis, days later. “I was finally close enough to death to deserve healthcare in Texas,” said Amanda Zurawski, who has been a powerful surrogate for Harris on the campaign trail. Todd Ivey, an OB-GYN in Houston, addressed the crowd surrounded by a team of doctors and medical professionals in white coats. He emphasized the challenges of administering care to patients under a law that threatens physicians with jail time for performing abortions. Since the Texas’s abortion law took effect the state’s infant mortality has risen. “These laws are designed to handcuff me – literally,” he said, declaring: “There is no place for Donald Trump in my exam room.” Among those in the crowd was Sara Gonzales, of Splendora, Texas, who rescheduled her work schedule so that she could drive straight to the stadium after finishing an early-morning shift at Starbucks. The 32-year-old said she considers herself an independent and in 2020, wrote in a candidate for president. But the political stakes changed, Gonzales said, the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, and Texas enacted its near-total ban on abortion. She plans to vote for Harris in the 5 November election. “Being a woman in Texas right now, it’s not OK,” she said. “I should have freedom over my own body.”","2024-10-26T13:48:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/26/beyonce-brings-star-power-to-harris-rally-in-texas-with-abortion-law-in-the-spotlight"
"abortion","No surgical abortion providers in seven out of 10 Victorian local government areas, report finds","Seven out of 10 Victorian local government areas have no surgical abortion provider and one in five have no medical abortion provider, a new report shows. The Realising Access report released on Thursday by the not-for-profit Women’s Health Victoria also found “service deserts” most profoundly affect women in high-disadvantage regional areas. Women in such areas are 300% more likely to seek abortion services later than nine weeks, meaning they require a surgical abortion for which there are even fewer providers. The WHV report is the first time that data at this scale from abortion and sexual and reproductive health service seekers has been published in Australia. There is no specific Medicare number for abortions, meaning there is no accurate information about the rate of abortions in Australia. Dr Nisha Khot, the vice-president of the peak body for obstetricians and gynaecologists, said the report was all the more worrying because Victoria was the leader in Australia when it comes to access to sexual and reproductive health services. “If the leader has these problems, imagine what these other states might be going through,” Khot said. The report analysed the de-identified data from all calls between 2018 and 2023 to WHV’s phone line 1800 My Options, which offers free and confidential information about contraception and pregnancy options, including abortion, and sexual health. Of those 30,344 calls, 87% were seeking abortion services. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It also analysed the service’s map of 725 registered sexual and reproductive health providers, alongside indicators from the Victorian Women’s Health Atlas and population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Of the 79 local government areas in Victoria, 53 (67%) did not have any listed surgical abortion providers, 31 (39%) did not have any medical abortion dispensing pharmacies, and 15 (19%) did not have any medical abortion providers (practitioners or hospitals). Medical abortions are drug-induced terminations which can be administered up to nine weeks gestation, whereas surgical abortions, a day-surgery procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue, can be performed up to 20 weeks gestation, depending on the state’s legislation. Access to sexual and reproductive services was even worse within Victoria’s 24 regional and rural high disadvantage LGAs, where almost half (45%) did not have any medical abortion providers, more than half (60%) did not have any medical abortion dispensing pharmacies, and nearly a third (29%) did not have any providers of intrauterine devices (a long-acting contraception). Khot said the lack of access to medical abortions was especially concerning because it is safer for women, and endorsed the report’s recommendation for no-cost or low-cost contraception. Compared with abortion seekers living in a metropolitan low disadvantage LGA, those living in high disadvantaged metropolitan areas were 17% more likely to be over nine weeks gestational age, the report found. Those living in low disadvantaged regional areas were 200% more likely, and those living in high disadvantaged regional areas were 300% more likely. Carolyn Mogharbel, the manager of 1800 My Options, said women living in metropolitan low disadvantage LGAs could often access services in nearby LGAs. But in high disadvantage LGAs, particularly in regional areas, which are clustered next to one another, the situation was “profoundly” difficult. “It means that if you’re in one of those regional high disadvantage LGAs you can’t just travel, for example, 200km to the next LGA,” she said. “You’ll have to cross several LGAs to be able to access that service.” Sally Hasler, the chief executive of Women’s Health Victoria, said it was “unacceptable” – but not a coincidence – that the most disadvantaged and marginalised communities with the least access to contraception and abortion were the same which experience an increased demand for abortion over nine weeks. “The lack of choice that women from under-served communities have starts with their access to contraception and goes all the way through to their right to choose if, when and how to have an abortion.” The report comes as several states debate abortion, sparked by conservative politicians seeking to re-examine the issue. Abortion is featuring heavily in the Queensland state election and South Australia’s parliament narrowly rejected a motion last week that would have wound back abortion care. Victoria’s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said the report spoke to the complexities and importance of work under way in Victoria, including expanding access to abortion in public hospitals. “Although we have fabulous support in Victoria in our government for abortion access and abortion rights, when those kind of discussions are happening in other states and internationally, it increases the stigma and the shame around abortion, and it makes people worried about seeking medical care,” Mogharbel said.","2024-10-23T19:00:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/no-surgical-abortion-providers-in-seven-out-of-10-victorian-local-government-areas-report-finds"
"abortion","Ohio Planned Parenthood affiliate rejects Medicaid amid fears over Trump cuts","An Ohio affiliate of Planned Parenthood said it will not accept Medicaid insurance because of uncertainty around a judge’s ruling ordering the Trump administration to continue sending Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood health centers. The operator of four clinics said it was concerned the administration could try to claw those payments back if the ruling is overturned. A second group of a dozen health centers is not offering long-acting contraceptive devices for Medicaid patients for similar reasons. The moves come after US district judge Indira Talwani blocked a provision of the sweeping tax bill that “defunds” abortion providers for one year if they received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in 2023. (The payments would be for non-abortion services like birth control and STI testing, as federal law already prohibits the program from covering abortions outside a few exceptions.) The order prevents the administration from enforcing the law against Planned Parenthood; an independent provider in Maine filed a separate suit and a hearing is scheduled for next week. The Trump administration filed notice on Tuesday that it would appeal the ruling to the first circuit court of appeals; the case will almost certainly make it to the US supreme court. Roughly a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics have announced closures since the bill was signed into law, with the latest including the organization’s only two health centers in Louisiana. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said its New Orleans and Baton Rouge clinics would close on 30 September. Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio (PPSWO), one of two affiliates in the state, said in a statement that, while it was “relieved” to see Talwani’s order, it would not resume accepting Medicaid, though it was seeing Medicaid patients who self-pay. “Unfortunately for many smaller affiliates, the risk of the federal government requesting back pay if the injunction expires is still too great,” a spokesperson said, citing legal filings in which the Trump justice department said it would seek to “claw back” payments if it ultimately wins the case. “We’re trying to mitigate that risk to preserve our capacity to offer the other critical services south-west Ohioans and hundreds of patients from the south come to us for,” a PPSWO spokesperson added, mentioning abortion and gender-affirming care. PPSWO closed two health centers at the end of July, leaving it with four clinics. The spokesperson said the judge’s injunction did not allow it to reopen the shuttered clinics in Springfield and Hamilton. “Across the country and even within a state we may see different strategic approaches to this devastating loss [for affiliates],” the affiliate said. “This course of action was ultimately the best option for us with long-term sustainability in mind.” The other Ohio affiliate, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio (PPGOH), said that, while it was accepting Medicaid at its 12 clinics after the injunction, it would not provide intrauterine devices or birth control implants to Medicaid patients – unless they self-pay for the devices and the insertion appointments. These forms of long-acting reversible contraception are some of the most effective, but they are costly and can be hard for low-income patients to access. Nearly all Planned Parenthood clinics offer same-day insertions of IUDs and implants, compared with 60 to 70% of other family-planning clinics and health departments, per the Guttmacher Institute. In a statement to the Guardian, PPGOH said it would not offer IUDs or Nexplanon implants to patients with Medicaid over fears that the Trump administration will demand that money be repaid if it ultimately wins in court. “These are the most expensive services we provide and to protect the organization from the risk of extreme financial loss, we can’t risk providing these services now and then never having the claims paid,” a PPGOH spokesperson said. Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the umbrella organization that oversees a network of nearly 50 independent regional affiliates, which run roughly 600 clinics across the US. The budget bill defines abortion clinics as “prohibited entities” for Medicaid if they hit the aforementioned reimbursement threshold and perform abortions as of 1 October. During negotiations for the bill, when the “defund” period was 10 years, PPFA’s accreditation board informed affiliates about new waivers to seek approval to cease providing abortions; doing so may allow them to remain in Medicaid. It’s not known if any affiliates have submitted such waivers after the one-year provision was signed into law, but some are changing their billing practices, such as in Ohio. Other affiliates, meanwhile, have said they are back to processing Medicaid insurance claims as they typically would following the preliminary injunction. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s chief strategy officer, Michelle Velasquez, told NPR that the judge’s 28 July ruling “means that there is no doubt about whether or not we can provide that care” to patients with Medicaid. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and Planned Parenthood of Maryland confirmed to the Guardian that they had resumed billing the health insurance program. Some are proceeding with caution. As of Thursday, Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties in California had a notice on its website saying that Planned Parenthood “has been blocked” from receiving Medicaid funds. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson said: “PPOSBC is in the process of carefully resuming its billing for California Medi-Cal services it has provided since the defunding provision was passed, tracking all legal and regulatory updates from the court and the state, and modifying its approach as changes occur to ensure ongoing compliance with currently applicable law.”","2025-08-08T13:00:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/ohio-planned-parenthood-medicaid-trump"
"abortion","Planned Parenthood offices begin rejecting Medicaid after Trump signs bill to defund healthcare organization","At least two regional Planned Parenthood affiliates have notices on their websites telling patients that, thanks to a provision in Republicans’ new tax-and-spending bill that “defunds” the reproductive healthcare giant, they can no longer accept Medicaid. However, this provision – which abortion rights supporters have called a “backdoor abortion ban” – was recently blocked by a court order. Other Planned Parenthood affiliates are continuing to treat patients who use Medicaid to pay for treatment. Although the Planned Parenthood network is overseen by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, it includes dozens of independent affiliates that directly provide care to patients. As of Wednesday afternoon, Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington DC and Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains had notices on their websites alerting patients that they can no longer accept Medicaid, the US government’s insurance program for low-income people. “With the passage of the reconciliation bill into law on July 4, 2025, Planned Parenthood health centers, including Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, DC (PPMW) centers, can no longer accept Medicaid coverage for care,” reads the statement on Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington DC’s website, which lists a number of ways patients can still find funding for care. “This ‘defund’ provision is a cruel, harmful, and inhumane law that will strip health care from thousands of people in the DC metropolitan region and millions across the country.” Neither Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington DC nor Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains immediately responded to a request for comment. “There are no other providers who can fully meet the needs of millions of patients if the ‘defunding’ of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand,” Danika Severino Wynn, vice-president of care and access at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood health centers are committed to doing everything they can to still see patients – and will continue to do so – while complying with all laws amid the chaos, cruelty and confusion intentionally sown by the new law the Trump administration and its backers in Congress passed that seeks to shut down Planned Parenthood and ban abortion nationwide.” Some of these affiliates’ notices were initially flagged by reporter Susan Rinkunas of Autonomy News, an outlet that covers issues related to bodily autonomy. On 4 July, Donald Trump signed into law a sprawling tax-and-spending bill that, in addition to directing trillions of dollars towards tax cuts and immigration enforcement, blocks Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving Medicaid funding for at least one year. This ban, which fulfills conservatives’ long-running pledge to “defund” Planned Parenthood, would force the organization to close roughly 200 health centers. Blue states, which are home to larger numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries, would probably take a disproportionate hit. Planned Parenthood sued over the “defunding” provision on Monday, claiming that it violates the US constitution in multiple ways. A judge agreed to freeze the defunding provision for at least two weeks. A spokesperson for another affiliate, Planned Parenthood of Florida, confirmed that, after the judge’s order, the group was again scheduling patients who rely on Medicaid. “Over the weekend, we had to cancel appointments for patients that used Medicaid coverage to receive care at our health centers, which was an incredibly painful and stressful process for the patients and the staff,” said Michelle Quesada, vice-president of communications for Planned Parenthood of Florida. “It’s a rapidly changing situation.” Since it is illegal to use Medicaid to pay for the vast majority of abortions, Planned Parenthood clinics rely on the insurance program to reimburse them for providing services like birth control, STI tests and cancer screenings. About one in 10 female Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of 15 and 49 go to Planned Parenthood for their family-planning services. “We’re facing a reality of the impact on shutting down almost half of abortion-providing health centers,” Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood Federation of Americas’s CEO, told the Guardian last week. “It does feel existential. Not just for Planned Parenthood, but for communities that are relying on access to this care.”","2025-07-10T15:25:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/planned-parenthood-medicaid"
"abortion","Zodiac Killer Project review – true crime critique rescues aborted documentary","If Laurence Sterne made a true-crime documentary it might resemble this exasperating, sometimes negligible but also often amusing and rather insightful personal work from British film-maker Charlie Shackleton. It is a deconstruction of genre and a meta story of failure from which the director salvages a teaspoonful of success. Shackleton recounts his abortive attempt to make a film about the Zodiac serial killer, who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay Area without being caught, and whose case is still open. It was also the subject of a movie by David Fincher. Shackleton intended to adapt a book entitled The Zodiac Killer Cover-Up: The Silenced Badge by Lyndon E Lafferty, a former California highway patrol cop who died in 2016. Lafferty believed he knew the identity of Zodiac. He once witnessed someone at the wheel of a car behaving suspiciously, who at one stage engaged in a weird stare-out contest with Lafferty in a car-park. Serious criminals are often caught through minor traffic violations so, following a hunch which was to turn into a lifelong obsession, Lafferty recovered a photo of the car’s owner using the licence plate and it resembled the police photofit of the Zodiac’s face. But despite decades of sleuthing and covert surveillance, he never amassed evidence firm enough to persuade law enforcement to follow his lead. He was ordered to drop the case by his infuriated superiors – which Lafferty considered evidence of a cover-up but may just have been their fury at his timewasting. Lafferty later suffered the indignity of his work being mocked in the more authoritative book by Robert Graysmith. Shackleton had what he thought was the go-ahead from Lafferty’s family to adapt his book. He did research, he scouted locations, he incurred expenses – but then they suddenly changed their minds and said he couldn’t proceed. Why? Shackleton thinks it could be down to a more lucrative deal from Netflix or someone similar, or maybe they didn’t like the line Shackleton was taking. Perhaps they suspected he was going to emphasise the tragicomedy of Lafferty’s failure and didn’t want him emerging as the David Brent of the Zodiac conspiracy community. Instead, Shackleton shows us the kind of movie he would have made, almost scene-by-scene, using long static shots of empty locations and his own wry voiceover, with information in the public domain so that he doesn’t get sued for copyright. (This is a familiar move for Shackleton, whose collage films Beyond Clueless (2014) and Fear Itself (2015) used short clips under the “fair use” rule.) I couldn’t help wishing that Shackleton had simply cut his losses and gone on to another project that he could have made properly. However, this one is interspersed with very amusing comments on all the cliches and mannerisms of the true crime genre: the grimly downbeat opening titles, the procedural-fetish small lettering for the credits, the hackneyed Super-8 footage to indicate the killer’s smalltown upbringing, the gloatingly presented crime-scene photos and, hilariously, the almost supernatural confidence of the real-life cops who speak on camera. These moments are very funny and interestingly researched; Shackleton is very shrewd on The Jinx, Andrew Jarecki’s true-crime streamer from 2015, and the way that it was able to withhold crucial facts about guilt until the season finale without getting into trouble. Without this critique, Zodiac Killer Project really would be very thin. Even so, it’s a bit slender but diverting nonetheless. • Zodiac Killer Project screens at the Sundance film festival.","2025-01-28T03:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jan/28/zodiac-killer-project-review-charlie-shackleton-documentary"
"abortion","Queensland Greens vow ban on new deals to outsource hospital services to anti-abortion organisations","The Greens have promised to introduce a bill banning the Queensland government from any new deals to outsource public hospitals to organisations that refuse to provide abortions. The promise, days before the Queensland election, comes amid a heated statewide abortion debate. It follows reporting by Guardian Australia last year revealing concerns that Catholic-run public hospitals would not provide reproductive care. Labor has sought to make abortion a key issue at Saturday’s poll, after the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, repeatedly refused to outline his personal position or say whether Liberal National party MPs would be granted a conscience vote. While the issue is playing out in the mainstream contest between Labor and the LNP, pollsters say the biggest impact could be to bolster the government’s support among progressive voters, including in areas where seats are at risk to the Greens. On Thursday the Greens will announce a “universal access” policy and have sought to draw attention to Labor failures to increase access, including deals with the Catholic organisation Mater to run public hospitals. On the eve of the state election, Labor spruiked $1bn funding for a new “world-class” public hospital at Springfield – the state’s fastest-growing region – that would be built and run by Mater, which refuses on religious grounds to perform abortions or offer birth control. “[The Springfield hospital] will be the only public hospital in town, and thanks to Labor it will be run by an ideologically anti-choice organisation, leaving women and pregnant people to travel away from home to access this basic healthcare,” said the Greens health spokesperson, Amy MacMahon. “Labor should know better. Public hospitals should be publicly run, and never discriminate based on outdated ideological dogma.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Guardian Australia’s reporting on the practices at Catholic-run hospitals prompted criticism of Labor governments for refusing to tie public hospital funding to full reproductive care. The Greens’ proposed ban on any new deals to outsource the running of health or hospital services to “anti-choice” organisations would not apply to existing arrangements, including the Mater public and mothers’ hospitals at South Brisbane, and the under-construction hospital at Springfield. Labor decriminalised abortion in 2018 and last year passed new laws allowing nurses to prescribe medical abortion pills. The Greens say that despite the progress not enough has been done to allow access. The party’s policy would require each of the state’s 15 health and hospital service regions to offer appropriate termination of pregnancy services. It would also make access to medical abortions free at public health clinics, in addition to providing funding for telehealth services and travel subsidies for women who cannot access local services. “Despite legalisation, access to abortion is still a postcode lottery, and for many people, their only option will be a costly private clinic that can cost between $250 and $4,000,” MacMahon said. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that Crisafulli previously told a live audience: “I don’t believe in late-term abortions.” He told a debate on Wednesday night he supported a woman’s right to choose. The issue has gained traction due to Crisafulli’s ongoing refusal to say whether his MPs – including several who are on record opposing abortions – would be given a conscience vote should the matter reach the floor of parliament. Labor says its MPs would be given a conscience vote; the vast majority support the party’s laws, but a handful have supported amendments or abstained from votes in recent years. The Greens say their MPs would vote as a bloc and be bound by the party’s pro-choice position. MacMahon said Greens MPs would “never vote to make it harder to access abortion, or ever vote to make it a crime”. The health minister, Shannon Fentiman, said this month in response to questions about the Springfield hospital deal with Mater that Labor was “leading the nation for termination of pregnancy services and support”. The government says all health and hospital services offer “pathways” for women to access termination of pregnancy services – including via satellite hospitals, nurse-led clinics and a planned virtual clinic – and that these will be available to women in the Springfield area.","2024-10-23T14:00:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/24/queensland-election-abortion-policy-greens-lnp-labor"
"abortion","Anti-abortion activist targets high-profile SA women with ‘baby-killers club’ social media posts","The architect of “forced birth” abortion legislation in South Australia has painted high-profile women as being in a “baby-killers club” on social media. Joanna Howe, who has been credited by politicians in state and federal parliaments for her anti-abortion work, posted artworks of women including the SA Greens leader, Tammy Franks, to Instagram and X. Franks said the posts were “designed to promote hatred”. Howe posted the distorted illustrations of the women’s faces under the title “The Baby-Killers Club”, in a similar style to the popular book series The Baby-Sitters Club. The women depicted voted or argued against legislation Howe helped create, which aimed to make women who sought an abortion after 27 weeks and six days’ gestation instead to be induced and give birth, and either keep the baby or adopt it out. Comments under the post were full of personal vitriol aimed at the women. On Howe’s list were SA’s deputy premier, Susan Close, the minister for women, Katrine Hildyard, the former Liberal deputy premier and attorney general Vickie Chapman, the academic Barbara Baird, the SA Best MLC Connie Bonaros, the public health professor Katina D’Onise and Franks. Howe, an employment law professor at the University of Adelaide, was instrumental in drafting the legislation introduced to parliament by the Liberal frontbencher Ben Hood. He credited her as the legal lead on the bill. It has been described by the Greens and others as “forced birth” legislation. The Howe-Hood bill was narrowly defeated in SA’s upper house last week, 10 votes to nine. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Hood had previously said a woman’s right to end a pregnancy was maintained under the proposal because pregnancy ended when a baby was born. “The innovation of this bill is that it allows a mother to end her pregnancy throughout all nine months and indeed, right up to birth,” he said. Howe runs a website called Justice for the 45 which claims 45 “healthy” and “perfect” babies have been killed “legally” since SA laws were reformed to allow abortions after 22 weeks and six days. SA Health data shows that in 2023, the year after the reforms, there were 47 terminations – less than 1% of all terminations performed – all because of foetal abnormalities or risks to the mother. Fewer than five terminations were performed after 27 weeks over the 18-month period after the reforms. Abortions after 27 weeks and six days are extremely rare. All later terminations must be approved by two doctors and only be carried out if there is significant risk to the woman and the foetus. Examples include if the foetus has severe abnormalities, or if the woman’s life is at risk – or her mental health because, for instance, she is the victim of rape, incest or domestic violence. Pregnancies can proceed to a later stage if women are prevented from seeking earlier help or are incapable of seeking help for various reasons. There are also delays in the system, particularly for women living in rural and remote areas. Testing for abnormalities can also delay the process. Franks said concerned friends and family had drawn her attention to Howe’s Instagram post. “It baffles me why somebody would do that in the first place, and it baffles me further why they’d only target the women members of parliament,” Franks said. Bonaros said she would ask Howe “to reflect on the damage and hurt she has caused – not to me or my colleagues but to the families impacted”. “I’ll sleep comfortably knowing I’ve made the right decision for every woman and family facing the sort of gut-wrenching circumstances that late-term termination brings with it – and my thoughts are with them and only them,” she said. D’Onise said abortion was “clearly a highly emotive matter”. “My focus is on high quality, scientific, evidence-based health law, policy and practice,” she said this week. Howe has said she wanted to make abortion “unthinkable”. She appeared in a video with the rightwing Liberal senator Alex Antic talking about a “born alive” bill he co-sponsored with the LNP senator Matt Canavan and the United Australia party senator Ralph Babet. The “born alive” concept, promoted for years in the US, falsely claims that babies are routinely born alive after abortions. Howe also filmed a video with Robbie Katter, from Katter’s Australian party, about his “born alive” legislation. Katter has said he would consider forcing a vote to recriminalise abortion in Queensland, contributing to abortion becoming a bigger issue in that state’s election campaign. Other politicians have cited Howe when arguing for restricted access to abortion. She is a vocal opponent of women who have abortions being eligible for the federal government’s stillborn baby payment, and told Sky News that women having a later-stage termination were “intentionally inducing a child stillborn”. The Labor MLC Russell Wortley said in the SA parliament during the forced birth debate that there were “no sources or references about the position [Howe] takes” and that it was “not supported by her employer”, the university. Wortley said he had received information debunking “every single item” Howe had raised. Howe did not initially respond to Guardian Australia’s questions directly but said on Instagram that Guardian Australia was writing a “hit piece” on her. Asked why there were only women on the “baby-killers club” list, she said: “I’m not sure there are only women on the list.” There are only women on the list. Guardian Australia asked Howe whether referring to the “baby-killers club” was appropriate, whether the posts were designed to promote hatred, whether she described herself as a feminist, how she thought her posts might affect the women named and women who had abortions, and whether she believed women had abortions to access stillborn payments. Howe did not respond directly to Guardian Australia’s questions but read them out on Instagram and subsequently posted graphic details and animations of abortions and said she thought the “baby-killers club” description was “pretty apt”. She later sent a link to her Instagram post to Guardian Australia.

"abortion","Harris’s powerful abortion stance and Trump’s fact-checks: key takeaways from the debate","The presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Kamala Harris went head to head on Tuesday night in their first – and potentially only – debate before voters head to the polls on 5 November. The candidates went into the event virtually tied in the polls with just weeks to convince a small but mighty minority of unsure voters on how to cast their ballot. After weeks of arguments over the format and rules, the debate aired live on ABC from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a key swing state, with no audience in attendance and each candidate’s microphone muted while their opponent spoke. This was the second presidential debate this year for Trump, who also went up against Joe Biden in June. The latter’s devastating performance triggered an upheaval within the Democratic party that would ultimately push Biden to step down and position Harris to head the ticket, an outcome Trump both takes credit for and complains about at his rallies. With just 55 days until votes are tallied, Harris strived to highlight that she has a plan, and clearly responded to criticisms that she hasn’t shared enough details with voters about her platform and priorities. With focused rhetoric on planning for the future, building the middle class and reframing her record on everything from immigration to climate, Harris was able to show voters how she hopes to lead. Analysts, meanwhile, were watching Trump’s demeanor and clarity. The former president repeated frequent rhetoric from his rallies – including widely disputed claims about abortion, crime and his belief that he won the 2020 election – but shared little about how he would address key problems Americans are facing. Beyond their differences in policy positions, the candidates also displayed diverging visions of the country. Trump promised his base to restore what he sees as the glory of the past, and Harris heralded the hope of a brighter future. Here are the highlights: Trump repeatedly spewed misinformation Throughout the debate Trump spread misinformation to make his points, repeating already debunked rhetoric on everything from the results of the 2020 election to his involvement in Project 2025 – a conservative-backed plan to change the US government from the inside out. The former president distanced himself from the January 6 attack on the Capitol, saying he was there only to make a speech, and blamed the then House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, for not beefing up security. He also incorrectly said crime rates had risen in the US when they have in fact fallen. ... and was frequently fact-checked by the moderators ABC’s moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, were largely praised for delivering a strong performance. They effectively rerouted discussions back to the questions they had asked on key topics including the economy, immigration, abortion rights and the peaceful transfer of power, and made important clarifying fact-check statements when they were warranted. Muir and Davis are veteran journalists who have collectively spent decades helping the American public navigate presidential positions. Feedback for their performance stands in contrast to the CNN debate in June, when moderators frequently missed opportunities to fact-check Trump and Joe Biden. Harris defended Democrats’ position on reproductive rights When challenged on his changing take on access to abortion care, Trump made some alarming – and easily refuted – claims that Democrats supported executing babies after they are born. He also took credit for overturning of Roe v Wade, a decision made by the supreme court after he appointed three members to make a 6-3 conservative majority, that was unpopular with the majority of Americans. Trump did clarify his position, though, that he believes in exceptions for rape, incest and threats to the mother’s life. Harris called his stances “insulting to the women of America”, and countered his statements that he delivered on a promise to bring the issue back to the states by saying “the people of American have voted for freedom”. She highlighted the difficult realities faced by women in states with abortion bans and would-be mothers who would struggle to access IVF care. The candidates both touted their work to improve the economy Harris was quick to tout her “opportunity economy”, a plan that includes tax reductions for those starting small businesses, relief for new parents and first-time homebuyers, and a crackdown on corporate price-gouging. “I am the only person on this stage that is about lifting up the middle class,” Harris said, noting her upbringing in a middle-class household. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that he oversaw the “best economy”, even with the downturn caused by the Covid pandemic, and accused his opponent of increasing costs on American families. “People can’t go out and buy cereal, or bacon, or anything else,” he said. Inflation did spike under the Biden-Harris administration, but it has fallen just as quickly. As of August, the US inflation rate settled at 2.9%. Trump also touted his stance on tariffs, which he plans to prioritize if he regains the White House. Trump spouted sometimes racist claims about immigrants Throughout the debate, Trump pivoted his talking points to immigration, spouting claims about criminals being welcomed into the country and towns where pets are eaten by incoming immigrants. While debate moderators attempted to counter the claims, challenging Trump on the validity and also on how he would execute the deportation of millions as he’s promised to do, Harris took the offensive. Highlighting her record as “the only person on the stage who has prosecuted transnational organizations”, she also accused her opponent of calling on the GOP to oppose legislation to bolster the border. “He preferred to run on a problem rather than fixing a problem,” she said. The candidates sparred over Ukraine and how they would handle the war Harris said that if Trump were currently in office, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, would have taken Kyiv, saying Putin would “eat you for lunch”. “I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up,” Harris also said. When Trump was asked by Muir how he would end the war – and specifically if he wanted Ukraine to win – the former president didnot offer a clear answer. “I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being lost uselessly. People being killed by the millions,” he said. When pressed again on if it was in the US best interest for Ukraine to win he doubled down. “I think it’s the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, all right, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed.” Harris baited Trump by attacking him where it hurts As moderators pushed Harris to respond to criticisms she and Biden have faced over border policy, the vice-president expertly derailed her opponent’s rhetoric on what is perhaps his favorite issue to discuss by deriding his performances at rallies. She invited voters to view the speeches for themselves, saying that attenders can be seen leaving out of exhaustion and boredom, and characterized the events as a platform for Trump’s complaints and not plans that put the American people first. The jab landed well. An offended and flustered Trump jumped on the chance to defend attendance at his rallies, claiming Harris pays attenders at her own campaign events, and then pivoted to insults that failed to hit their mark. He accused Harris of planning to turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids”, and called the US a “failing nation”, before resurfacing false claims that immigrants were eating people’s pets.

Queenslanders gathered outside parliament to protest LNP’s treaty stance. Sydney and Melbourne house prices to keep falling but rate cut will cause bounce, report predicts. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. Leading economists have predicted a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year. Christian lobby welcomes anti-abortion bill stay The Australian Christian Lobby has hailed the failure of a Greens motion aimed at discharging a private senators’ anti-abortion bill as “a victory for the democratic process”. The Greens Senate leader, Larissa Water, wanted the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The ACL CEO, Michelle Pearse, welcomed the Coalition and seven crossbenchers voting down the bill: “The ACL was pleased to see senators afford this Bill an opportunity for proper consideration and debate rather than shutting down the democratic process. We must allow this Bill to go to a proper vote.” The Greens motion to discharge the bill followed the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, telling Coalition MPs recently that they should not seek to restart public debate on abortion ahead of next year’s federal election. NSW avoids power supply issues but still faces ‘tight’ days Without jinxing things, NSW has so far avoided any blackouts as temperatures climb in eastern Australia. Sydney’s top temperature was kept to a bearable 28.2C while about 50km to the west, Penrith reached 39.7C to mark the Sydney basin’s warmest maximum for Tuesday. Penrith and a few other outer suburbs can expect a similar top on Wednesday at 39C, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts. The CBD, though, will be a bit hotter than today, heading form 34C – which would be the hottest there since late February. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, wholesale power prices may yet hit their ceiling of $17,500 a megawatt-hour (compared to more typical prices of $125/MWh) later on Tuesday as an indication of a “tight” or strained market. And tomorrow evening there will be more of the same, with a sign that an administered price cap of $600/MWh may kick in too: Aemo has been busy issuing its so-called lack of reserve alerts for NSW and Queensland in the past couple of days. They are intended to highlight when it wants more capacity brought on to ensure “the lights stay on”. The market does tend to respond (hence the absence of blackouts) but the fact Aemo is issuing them from lengthy periods for NSW for parts of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (before they get cancelled) point to the lingering impacts of the heatwave on the grid. And there are storms to look forward to, too. Bubble tea franchise Chatime fined $132,840 for underpaying workers The Fair Work Ombudsman has fined bubble tea franchise Chatime and its managing director $132,840 for the underpayments of more than $160,000 to vulnerable employees at 19 stores across Sydney and Melbourne. Earlier today, the federal circuit and family court imposed a $120,960 penalty against Chatime Australia, and a fine of $11,880 against Chatime Australia managing director, Chen “Charlley” Zhao, for his involvement in some of the underpayments. The court found that between August and December 2016, Chatime Australia paid employees at stores it directly operated flat rates as low as $7.59 to $24.30 an hour and adopted a practice of not paying Fast Food Industry Award entitlements such as loadings and penalty rates. As a result, 152 employees, including 41 junior workers aged below 21 and 95 visa holders, were underpaid a total amount of $162,533. Many of the visa holders were international students. The underpaid staff worked at 10 Chatime outlets across Sydney in Bondi Junction, Chatswood, Wetherill Park and the CBD; and nine Chatime outlets across Melbourne, in Dandenong, Doncaster, Glen Waverley, Cheltenham and the CBD. In his judgment, Judge Nicholas Manousaridis rejected Chatime Australia’s submission that the contraventions should not fall into the category of being either “serious” or “substantial”, and found that the matter involved a large number of employees who were underpaid basic Award entitlements. “Penalties should be set to signal to persons who manage companies that they will be met with substantial penalties if, through their neglect, they permit companies they manage to contravene terms of an award or any other industrial laws or instruments that might apply.” An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Greens indicated earlier on Tuesday that the motion would be deferred until February but the party’s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, suddenly brought on the vote on Tuesday afternoon. Waters was asking the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The Greens decided to ask the Senate to discharge the bill after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election. The Greens had hoped to secure the numbers to remove the bill and put pressure on the Coalition on a sensitive issue which the major parties usually consider a matter of conscience. But the opposition leadership pushed back, arguing it would set a bad precedent to use a majority vote to discharge a private senators’ bill – and implying it could happen to others. The opposition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, said he “would not and will not ever vote for this bill or any measures that restrict women’s reproductive rights”. But he said removing it would impede private senators’ rights and was a precedent that could be used against other bills. “Senators in particular should reflect on the precedent this motion sets that could see other bills discharged just because a majority opposed them,” Birmingham said. “Given this bill has been on the notice paper for almost two years, the decision of the Greens to pursue this at this time is clearly about politics, not the substantive issue.” The motion was lost, 30 votes to 28, with 18 senators not present. ACT independent senator David Pocock, two One Nation senators, former Liberal turned independent Gerard Rennick, United Australia party senator Ralph Babet and Tasmanian independents Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell joined the Coalition in opposing the motion. Pocock and Tyrrell both spoke in the chamber, saying they opposed the bill itself but supported the principle of allowing a private senators’ bill to remain and be debated. Larissa Waters suggested the Coalition’s move in defeating the motion contradicted Dutton’s edict to his partyroom. “By threatening crossbenchers with retaliation if they supported a Greens move to protect women’s rights, the Liberals … kept an anti-abortion bill on the Senate notice paper,” Waters told Guardian Australia. “The Liberal game-playing has confirmed that Mr Dutton does not want to talk about abortion because it would reveal that his party wants to restrict women’s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.” The NSW government will refund $5.5m worth of fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. More than 23,000 penalty notices will be withdrawn and the refunds will include any total or partial payments on the fines. The government committed to withdraw and refund the fines after a legal campaign by the Redfern Legal Centre (RLC) and Maurice Blackburn who asserted that the fines were improperly issued and invalid. Maurice Blackburn valued the more than 23,000 fines, some of which had not been repaid, at approximately $15m. In a statement, from RLC and Maurice Blackburn, they said the announcement came after Maurice Blakcburn notified the government it would file a class action if Revenue NSW did not withdraw and refund the fines. The RLC said the fines, which were typically worth $1,000 to $5,000, were disproportionately issued to socioeconomically disadvantaged people living in western and south-western Sydney. RLC found that among those fined were Indigenous children, children with cognitive impairments, and children experiencing homelessness. In 2022, the NSW government withdrew 33,000 fines related to Covid-19 health measures after it lost a legal challenge by RLC. The court found the fines were invalid because they did not include sufficient information about the offence. On Tuesday, the department of customer service said the remaining 23,000 fines also lacked details “which may render them technically deficient and place their validity in doubt”. Samantha Lee, supervising solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre, said: This outcome is the result of a significant and lengthy effort by Redfern Legal Centre, a team of dedicated counsel and Maurice Blackburn. The impact of Covid fines on marginalised communities and on children – was disproportionate, unreasonable, and unjust. ‘Nitazenes are extremely potent’: two opioid overdoses in NSW Two people in NSW have been hospitalised with severe opioid overdoses, prompting health authorities to warn about the dangers of synthetic opioids in fake oxycodone. The two people suffered overdoses after taking what they believed to be oxycodone tablets described as yellow unmarked round tablets, sold as OxyContin 40 mg. However, NSW health says they contained nitazenes – extremely potent synthetic opioids which are more likely to stop breathing than other opioids. NSW Poisons Information Centre medical director, Dr Darren Roberts, said these drugs can be hundreds of times more potent than oxycodone and can cause severe overdose or death. He said: “Nitazenes are extremely potent and can vary widely in their strength.” “As they are illicit and unregulated, there is no way of knowing what type of nitazene is present or what dosage is being taken. The strength and contents can vary widely, even within the same batch.” NSW Health said nitazenes have been detected in vapes and in fake tablets, such as benzodiazepines, and in drugs thought to be heroin or MDMA. Roberts said it was strongly recommended that anyone who uses illicit drugs carry naloxone. Nitazenes can last longer in the body than oxycodone, heroin and naloxone, meaning higher and repeated doses of naloxone may be required as well as hospital treatment. Teens need better protection from sex offenders: report Teenagers working alongside adults in Australia need to be better protected from sex offenders, a report says. The report into retailers has outlined a plan it hopes will ensure teens are not exposed to workplace predators across the country, AAP reports. The ‘‘Safety Not Guaranteed’ report by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and non-for-profit McKell Institute has recommended law changes to better protect children. The report found more than 500,000 children aged 17 and under were working across Australia mostly in retail but the majority were not adequately protected by law. It said only South Australia provided proper safeguards, after the state government passed laws in March banning child sex offenders from working with kids. The report has recommended other states and territories follow suit. It has called for legislation to be amended to ban accused and convicted sex offenders from working alongside children. The report also called for bail conditions to be tightened for convicted or accused sex offenders and reforms made to offender registries. The report said requirements for adults working alongside children were not strict in Australia. “Most Australians would be surprised to learn that there are few requirements for adults working alongside children to get ‘working with children’ checks,” it said. “This has led to incidences where adults charged, or even convicted, with child sex offences are working alongside children in retail, fast food and hospitality settings.” The report recommended that adults across the nation working alongside children be required to access the checks, in which they are screened for suitability. All states and territories should also ensure eligibility for “working with children” checks be expanded so that businesses voluntarily seeking them do so without a cost increase to workers. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on today’s blog – we’re nearly at the halfway point of this final sitting week, with two more jam-packed days ahead. But there’s still more to come this evening, so I’ll handover to Mostafa Rachwani to continue bringing you the latest. Take care. Explainer on Victorian government’s overhauled anti-vilification laws Earlier today, Benita Kolovos brought us news the Victorian government had unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the state’s anti-vilification laws. How will they change, and who will they protect? You can read her full explainer below: Gormon says Deloitte outlook ‘not government’s numbers’ Patrick Gorman was also asked to weigh in on the latest economic outlook from Deloitte – predicting a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year (see our earlier post). He answered that it’s “not the government’s numbers”: We understand that people will try and get the jump or guess what the numbers might be or in Deloitte’s case, modelling, but they are not our numbers. Gorman was asked whether the government has given up on increasing the tax rate on higher balanced superannuation accounts – as was promised a couple of budgets ago? Gorman said he couldn’t “tell you what decision the Senate will make over the next couple of days”. I wish I could. I wish we did not have a system where the opposition parties try to run things down until the last minute or the last hours of the Senate, but that is the system we have and we will see that play out on Wednesday and Thursday. But would you make it a number one item of debate on Wednesday morning? Gorman said “it remains part of our budget plan” but “we recognise the Australian people have given us a Senate that sometimes uses to prioritise things in different ways, and we have to work within that democratic system”. Labor MP welcomes passage of Help to Buy bill through senate The assistant minister to the PM, Patrick Gorman, is speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about the Greens’ concession to help Labor pass its housing bill. Asked if there were more deals to be cut, with a raft of legislation yet to make it through the Senate, he argued that these bills “stand on their own merits”. Of course people are frustrated that it took the Greens in particular so long, so much political gameplay, so many interviews with yourself and others about how they were here and in there and all over the place, finally it is done. As Paul Karp reports, the Help to Buy scheme – which passed the senate this afternoon – allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home or 40% for a new build for those who earn under the income thresholds of $90,000 for a single applicant, or $120,000 for a couple. The government share reduces the cost for the homebuyer, although it must be paid back upon sale. Temperatures climb towards 40C in parts of Sydney as power supplies remain tight Parts of Sydney have touched the 39C level forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology while sea breezes are so far keeping the CBD and other parts of the city’s east about 10C cooler. Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, chose to give a media conference at Canberra airport just before 2pm (AEST), to reassure the public that electricity suppliers were sufficient. Aemo had acted early to bring on generation capacity that was “potentially available” and to restore transmission lines, he said. (The latter was mostly to ensure NSW can import a lot of electricity.) Authorities were working to ensure generation remained adequate over the coming days, he said. As it happened, Aemo had issued another lack of reserve level 3 forecast at about noon (AEDT), implying that there was the possibility of “interruptible loads” now for Thursday at about 3.30pm (AEDT). As with previous LOR3 alerts, the market answered Aemo’s call, and the alert was cancelled at 1.54pm (AEDT) just as Westerman was wrapping up his slightly chaotic media conference (as some questioners phoned in questions he struggled to hear). Still, expect conditions to remain “tight” and hopefully no more of those ageing power units will conk out over the next couple of days. Nationals MP continues to voice concern over social media age ban Nationals MP Keith Pitt has been speaking to Sky News about his concerns regarding Labor’s under-16 social media ban bill. Yesterday, he became the latest to voice hesitation about the bill, joining his colleague Matt Canavan, the Greens and other Senate crossbenchers in alarm at the speed by which the bill is likely to be passed this week. Speaking just now, Pitt told the program: If you can’t actually fine anyone for not taking action [until 2026], then what difference will it make to take a few weeks to look at this in detail – this is one of the rare occasions I agree with my colleagues in the Senate where this is something that should be looked at more … My job as a backbencher is to make sure that people are doing this right. It’s not simply to trundle along and agree with everything that’s put before me. His main argument was that teenagers will be able to work around the ban – along with wanting more time to scrutinise the legislation. Analysis on government’s under-16s social media ban bill In case you missed it amid question time this afternoon, Josh Taylor has written a fantastic piece of analysis on the under-16s social media ban bill – asking why Labor is so intent on rushing it through? You can have a read of that below: Watch: China’s ambassador to Australia urges closer military ties Earlier today, China’s ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian spoke to reporters in Canberra and suggested Australia should do more to improve military ties with the People’s Liberation Army. We covered his remarks earlier in the blog, and you can now watch some of his remarks below, thanks to our video team: Going back to the under-16s social media ban, opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, says the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. We’ve asked Michelle Rowland’s office for comment but haven’t heard back yet. Coleman told the House of Representatives that the changes would be “significant improvements” to the bill. Firstly, the legislation will include a specific provision that nothing allows a social media to compel the provision of digital ID or government issued identity documents, such as passports, or drivers licenses. This is an important addition and further strengthens the privacy provisions in the legislation. Coleman said the second amendment was a clear power for the minister to specify steps which are not needed to be taken by social media companies to comply with the legislation – that is, the minister would be able to tell big tech what not to do in enforcing the age limit. With the use of identification documents now ruled out, supporters of the bill say platforms may look to biometric forms of age assurance, such as facial scanning, to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Coleman said: While the eSafety Commissioner will be responsible for formulating guidelines on what constitutes reasonable steps under the bill, the minister may direct that specific actions are not required in order for the platform to satisfy that reasonable steps test. This is also an important addition, as it allows the Minister to ensure that enforcement of the legislation is always appropriate and proportionate. With that, question time has wrapped up in the House of Representatives. Domestic violence payments The independent MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, is asking about the crisis payment for women leaving domestic violence – she said conditions exclude half the women who apply, and the payment is only available if a woman can show she fits the “narrow criteria” within seven days of leaving. Will the government review the conditions? The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, responded: While legislation requires that that person has seven days from the traumatic event to lodge a claim for crisis payment, there’s flexibility to support people in this circumstance. Services Australia provides an additional 14 days after contact to lodge a claim if they have experienced family and domestic violence. Notwithstanding that, we know as a government too often perpetrators of family domestic violence can exploit and manipulate government systems to control, harass, or threaten a current or former partner. Rishworth said the government would continue to look at the systems “across the board” on this. Liberal MP Henry Pike has asked another question along the lines of – how can Australians afford another three years of Labor? (The opposition has been finishing most of their questions with this line today). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded like he did with previous questions – by listing cost-of-living measures the government is taking, and criticising the opposition for voting against them. Because if things are free, apparently – according to the Liberal party philosophy – they’re not valued, which explains why you don’t support Medicare, and never have, why you don’t support public schools, and why you continue to just say what your against and not put anything forward constructively that will help. Just after Jim Chalmers wrapped up answering a dixer, the MP for Herbert Phillip Thompson was sent out under 94a. What is standing order 94a? You can have a read of this explainer for more information. Private health system accountability Independent MP Sophie Scamps has asked whether the government will support the call from the AMA for a private health system authority? She said her community is served by the only public-private partnership hospital in NSW, which recently terminated the contracts of private health insurers they believe are failing to adequately reimburse patients. The health minister, Mark Butler, said the sector had “suffered a price shock from Covid” amid other factors, “which impacts the business model of many hospitals and other things as well”. As a result, I asked the secretary of the department to conduct a health check on this sector – insurers, private hospital operators, [and] the AMA and patient groups were part of that. It was very constructive. I’ve published a version of that health check and asked the secretary to keep that forum going. It [will] discuss short-term options for reform of this sector soon, as well as long-term ideas that include the AMA idea, which they’ve been touting really for some time now, a different regulatory system. Question on food insecurity Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked the PM about growing rates of food insecurity. The minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, answered by listing measures the government has taken, and said: We will keep looking at all the ways that we can support people with cost of living, whether there’s that’s through emergency relief, food relief but importantly, through the cost-of-living measures, including tax cuts to every single taxpayer – something those opposite were never going to do. PM says opposition’s figures on insolvency are wrong The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked about the rate of business insolvencies. Anthony Albanese said the figures put forward by Ley – that more than 25,000 businesses have gone bust since Labor took office – are wrong. The minutes of the RBA’s monetary policy meeting [on] 24 September, said this – “The cumulative level of insolvencies was still below the pre-pandemic trend”. Who was in government pre-pandemic? … Those opposite. Labor ‘looking more like Whitlam government every day’: Dutton The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was up next to ask how Australian families and businesses “can possibly afford another three years of Labor”. He pointed to changes to the Future Fund, and said the Albanese government is “looking more like the Whitlam government every day”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded echoed earlier sentiments about the state of the economy when his government came to office, and the measures they have taken since. The fact is that the measures that we have introduced have all been opposed by those opposite … The difference between us and them is that they acknowledge people are under pressure, but want it to be worse. Albanese posed another question: how would any Australian have been better off under those opposite? They have no positive plans whatsoever, just reckless arrogance in their approach to the pressures that Australians are under. ‘They’re not’: Chris Bowen on why climate emissions are higher Greens MP Stephen Bates was next up to ask a question, asking the PM why climate emissions are higher under his government than when Scott Morrison went to office? The minister for climate change, Chris Bowen, responded that “they’re not”. That will be evident this week when we release the annual climate change statement, which is world’s best practice when it comes to accountability. Bowen also took aim at the opposition, saying: A government actually setting a clear policy agenda from the beginning, set by the Climate Change Act, supported by the safeguards reforms, supported by the new vehicle efficiency standards, supported by our capacity investment scheme, all of which has been done by this government – all of which has been opposed by the opposition, who want to stop all that while they wait for their nuclear fantasy to become a reality. Shadow treasurer asks question on latest Deloitte outlook The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question on the economy, pointing to the latest Deloitte outlook and changes to the Future Fund. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded by criticising the opposition’s economic track record: We have a plan for getting wages up. Increases, three of them, for people on the minimum wage. Remember back to the election campaign, Mr Speaker, when I took out that $1 coin and argued that a $1 coin, a $1 increase per hour … was something that we would support if the Fair Work Commission chose to do so. And those opposite said it would wreck the economy, the sky would fall in if that occurred. While taking a dixer on housing, the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, noted that Labor’s Help to Buy legislation had passed the Senate this afternoon. She said the government appreciates the support of those who voted in favour of the bill, “including the Australian Greens”. I’ve had a little bit of constructive criticism to offer the Greens in recent days, speaker, but let’s all agree, speaker, that at least the Greens are showing a modicum of interest in housing policy in this country. O’Neil said she had made “a number of attempts” to brief the shadow housing minister on “the policy offerings we’ve brought before this parliament”. It’s not that he can’t find the time to come to the briefings, speaker. He won’t even respond to our requests for a discussion. After a condolence motion for former Liberal minister John Hodges, question time has begun in the House of Representatives. First up is the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, asking about the latest financial outlook (from a Deloitte report, see earlier post). The prime minister said the government came to office “with a number of challenges that we were facing” – economic uncertainty, inflation and energy prices. He then listed a number of measures the government is taking, saying “they were all opposed by those opposite”. So certainly things, if they had’ve had their way, this reckless and arrogant opposition, things would have been worse. Just circling back to some comments Michael Sukkar made at the National Press Club, when asked if the Coalition would repeal Help to Buy if elected to government – noting this has just passed the senate. Sukkar backed repeal, and said: They’re terrible policies which is why we are in many respects, we’re unsurprised but dismayed that the Greens are now supporting it. On Build to Rent - the Greens have sold out ... they’ll vote with Labor to give preferential tax treatment to foreign corporates to own housing stock in this country for build to rent developments. We don’t think that the most beneficial tax arrangements for housing in this country should be the province of foreign fund managers ...As for the shared equity scheme, the fiddling while Rome burns, quite frankly, these schemes have been rejected by Australians and at a cost of $5.5bn - I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. Greens defer bid to dump Senate anti-abortion bill A Greens motion urging the Senate to discharge a controversial anti-abortion bill is being deferred until February, as the party focuses on negotiations with the government on a raft of stalled legislation in the final parliamentary week. Last week, Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters notified the Senate that she would move a motion today seeking to have the bill discharged. But Guardian Australia has been told the Greens have now opted to defer the motion until the parliament’s next sitting. The Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic that would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. It has been on the Senate notice paper for two years. But after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election, the Greens want the Senate to formally vote to remove the bill – something that would probably expose a split in the Coalition and possibly also Labor senators on what has traditionally been a conscience issue in the major parties. As expected, Labor’s housing bill has passed the Senate this afternoon, about 20 minutes ago. This comes after the Greens backed down on its concessions yesterday, and said it would help pass the legislation: Question time about to begin Question time is beginning in the House of Representatives in about five minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready – we’ll bring you all the key moments here on the blog. Cash says Dreyfus’ actions raise questions about independence of INSLM office Continuing from our last post, the shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash has told Guardian Australia that Mark Dreyfus’ actions raised questions about the independence of the INSLM office: The Attorney-General has extremely serious questions to answer. Mr Blight has confirmed that this alleged “ambiguity” was raised by the attorney’s office, and at one point was raised by the Attorney himself. To be clear, the “ambiguity” in question was a direct criticism of Mr Dreyfus. What did the Attorney think would happen? Does he seriously expect Australians to believe that he spoke to Mr Blight, pointed out the ambiguity, but expected nothing to happen? The Attorney needs to explain how this is a proper use of his power as Attorney-General. Mr Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC, who wrote the report, has been crystal clear that his report didn’t need “clarification”. What Attorney Dreyfus has done through his conduct is call into question whether our independent national security legislation monitor is truly independent. He needs to explain himself immediately. Opposition demands attorney general explain private talks with security watchdog The opposition is demanding the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explain a private discussion he had with Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) Jake Blight before Blight published a clarification to an old annual report that had criticised Dreyfus. As reported by Guardian Australia, Blight has confirmed that Dreyfus and one of his advisers separately raised concerns with him about what they argued was “ambiguity” in the watchdog agency’s 2022-23 annual report, which was produced by Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC. Blight has said he was neither asked nor directed to publish a clarification but that he decided to do so of his own accord. The clarification appeared in the 2023-24 annual report, published last month. Donaldson’s annual report contained criticisms of the federal government for failing to produce evidence in 2020 that was material to a court application by convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika opposing being subjected to a continuing detention order after his 20-year jail term ended in 2020. Donaldson discovered the evidence and made its existence public in 2022, prompting Benbrika to make another application – which ultimately succeeded. Donaldson’s annual report criticised the Department of Home Affairs for not providing the evidence to either Benbrika or the court in 2020 and the current attorney general, who inherited responsibility for the case after the 2022 federal election, for the fact that it was then only provided in full after a court order. It did not specifically mention the minister who had been responsible for home affairs at the time the evidence was first withheld, Peter Dutton. Donaldson said Dreyfus’s staff had raised “ambiguity” concerns with him before he finished his term as INSLM last year and that he had refused to change the report. We’ll bring you more on this in a moment. Greens won’t join race to ‘demonise migrants’ At the National Press Club, Max Chandler-Mather said the Greens wouldn’t participate in a “race to the bottom on who can demonise migrants more”, between the Liberals and Labor. Why is it every time there’s a crisis, that the rich and powerful in the major parties – backed by their big corporate donors – facilitate a debate in a race to the bottom in going after migrants? The Greens will not participate in that. We just won’t. The real solution to this is taking on those big corporations who are getting away with paying no tax, taking on those property investors and phasing out those tax handouts and getting back to a more fair and equitable system… He and Michael Sukkar just made their closing remarks, and the debate has wrapped up. Guardian asks Greens about their track record on housing supply Our own Paul Karp has asked about the Greens and Liberals track record on supply, and what commitment could they both give that at every level – federal, state and local – that their parties will be part of the solution and break their addiction to nimby votes? Max Chandler-Mather answered first, and said: I have been asked personally one time about what I thought about a social housing development in my electorate, and I wrote a letter supporting it. When we have written submissions on developments, our primary criticism is that a portion of that development is not being provided as social or affordable housing. Michael Sukkar responded next, and turned the lens on Labor instead: I would challenge you in one aspect – don’t give Labor state governments a leave pass for belatedly now trying to come up with solutions to a problem they created. He said many Australians living in the suburbs are very happy with some form of density, but “they shouldn’t be demonised for wanting to retain the essential character of the communities that they live in.” Max Chandler-Mather was asked why he hasn’t bought a home yet, and is still a renter, despite his earnings as an MP? He said he had a small, single-income family and gives up about $50,000 from his annual salary to fund a free meal program in his electorate: Because of that, giving up that money, and being on a single income and in an inner-city electorate with a very, very high median house price, it is actually sort of difficult at the moment to buy a house there. I want to be clear, though, I am not the one doing it tough – but I’m answering your question. Chandler-Mather says he doesn’t want to be a minister, prefers the crossbench Back at the National Press Club, the Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said he wouldn’t be defending Labor’s housing legislation – “and it is disappointing that the Labor housing minister isn’t here to defend them”. We’re not like the Liberals. We’re not just going to destroy, cut and block, and destroy any hope of actually fixing this housing crisis. We are trying to build public consensus for a large-scale action on this housing crisis. It has been our goal for the last few years, and indeed, for the entirety of the existence of the Greens. And I think that we’ve got some of the way there. Chandler-Mather was asked whether he would want to be a minister in a future minority government – noting Nick McKim was a minister in a Labor-Greens agreement in Tasmania. He responded: I think that personally, I would prefer to be on the crossbench and deciding on good pieces of legislation and pushing further after the next election. Dutton boosts Coalition MPs in final partyroom address Peter Dutton has told Coalition MPs that the Liberal and National parties are finishing the political year strongly, using his address to the final joint parties meeting for 2024 to rev them up ahead of an election year. Reminding them to focus on their electorates – citing the work of long-serving retiring MPs as an example – Dutton criticised the government’s priorities. The government is faltering and taking decisions that are making it even, even harder for families people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, but they also understand that if you get the economics right, you support families, and if you focus on what matters, that the country can get back on track. But you can only imagine what would happen under the chaos of a Greens Labor coalition. His deputy, Sussan Ley, urged MPs to maintain the “unity and discipline” over the summer, and determination to get things done, that they had shown in the past. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared that the next few days “indeed, the next few months” would determine the election result and when people’s credit card bills came rolling in around February, they should be reminded the pressure they felt was homegrown and “it wasn’t Vladimir Putin who created that problem”. The meeting was dominated by a lengthy debate on the government’s legislation to introduce a minimum age for social media use. The electoral reform bill, which the Coalition is supporting, was not discussed. Shadow housing minister says Liberals ‘unashamedly oppose’ Labor’s housing measures A reporter asked Michael Sukkar if the Coalition would repeal the Help to Buy and Help to Rent bills? He argued “these schemes have been rejected by Australians”, and said: I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. You don’t give any credit to the Labor party for coming up with new ideas – just like the housing minister couldn’t show up today to explain herself and the Labor party position. They have no ideas, no new policies … and that’s why we unashamedly oppose both of those measures, and will not do what the Greens have done, which is go back on all of the arguments and critiques [they made]. Sukkar and Chandler-Mather on how they would address labour shortage A reporter asked both Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Mather how they plan to address the labour shortage – with the former wanting to slash migration, and the latter wanting to build a large amount of public housing. Chandler-Mather pointed to the Greens’ push for a government-owned developer, which he said would signal to the construction industry how many homes need to be built. You can plan how many construction workers we need in that area and that area. The federal government used to employ architects and town planners and project managers in a genuine federal Housing Department, which is what we’re planning to establish. And Sukkar, responding to the question, said “the truth is that we need to rebalance our migration program”. Yes, we need less migrants, fewer migration from the rorted levels we’re at. By no means is the Coalition suggesting that we won’t have a healthy migration program, but it won’t be the reckless migration we’ve seen in recent years. Sukkar said “you don’t improve housing in this country by bringing in more yoga or fitness instructors” and argued that in this financial year alone only nine bricklayers were brought in. Shadow housing minister: ‘We’ll build more homes than Labor’ Labor has said that it has a target to build 1.2m new homes by the end of the decade – will the Coalition recommit to this goal if re-elected? At the National Press Club, shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar said that “we’ll build more homes than Labor”. It’s almost industry consensus now that not only will Labor not meet their 1.2m homes … they won’t get close, they’ll miss it by more than 400,000 homes. Around 800,000 homes is what the industry expects will be built based on the current trajectory, and may I add, that trajectory is still getting worse. So it could even be worse than 800,000. Some Coalition members may vote against the under-16s social media ban when it is voted on in parliament, with some 20 opposition members debating the online legislation in a marathon partyroom meeting this morning. The opposition “overwhelmingly” backed the bill, according to a party room spokesperson, but it’s understood a small handful spoke against it. Guardian Australia revealed recently that Matt Canavan and Keith Pitt, the Queensland Nationals members, had strong reservations about privacy elements of the bill. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke strongly for the bill, praising the campaigning of communications spokesperson David Coleman for pushing the issue as far as it has gone. The party room spokesperson said Dutton had negotiated “concessions” on the legislation, including an amendment to the legislation that would ensure there is no compulsion for people to hand over any form of government ID to social media platforms to verify their age. That’s understood to include drivers licenses and passports. About 19 Coalition members spoke in favour of the bill, but “two or three” spoke against it. At least one told the meeting they would vote against the legislation, while two others reserved their right to potentially vote against it. Chandler-Mather criticises Liberals for focus on migration amid housing debate Max Chandler-Mather has accused the Liberals of bringing up migration in the housing debate to “distract” from the fact the “real winners” are large property investors and the banks. He told the National Press Club: Of course the Liberals bring up migrants. Of course they do, because it is such a useful tool for them to distract from the fact that the real winners out of the housing crisis – the ones really hurting people right now – are the large property investors and the bank, and the property industry who benefit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. The Liberals were in power for nine years. What did they do? Give tax handouts to property investors, build less public housing than any government in Australian history since World War II, help to screw over renters. It is genuinely remarkable that the Liberals won’t take any responsibility for this housing crisis. It hardly gives me any confidence that they are going to be able to fix it. Shadow housing minister accuses Labor and Greens of being in a coalition The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has weighed in on the Greens’ capitulation to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy legislation, and said: The theatre of the Greens and Labor fighting in the parliament really betrays the truth, which is Labor and the Greens are in an unholy alliance – a Coalition. On housing, the government has repeatedly accused the Greens of working with the Coalition and Peter Dutton. Max Chandler-Mather addresses housing debate at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has wrapped up his opening remarks, and now the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather is up. He has told the National Press Club that “the barrier to fixing this housing crisis is not economic, it’s not technical – it’s political”. He argued Australia’s political system “has been corrupted by the power of the banking and property industry”, and said Labor and the Liberals “pursue policies that either push up house prices or give more money to property developers.” Chandler-Mather said today’s housing crisis can be linked to two changes in the 1990s – cuts to funding for public housing, and the introduction of capital gains tax by John Howard. Over the next 10 years, the Australian government will give property investors $176bn in tax handouts in the form of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. The housing crisis we find ourselves in right now is enormous but we can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. He is outlining measures the Greens would push for, including: Phasing out tax handouts such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, and using the money to create a government-owned property developer Develop new national tenancy standards, including long-term caps on rent increases A national renter’s protection authority to enforce the tenancy standards and issue fines to those who break the law Housing debate begins at National Press Club At the National Press Club in Canberra, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens’ housing and homelessness spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, are about to begin a debate. Club director Andrew Probyn told the crowd that the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, was also asked to appear but declined. Paul Karp flagged some details of what Sukkar will say, which you can read earlier in the blog here. We’ll bring you the key takeaways as the debate gets under way. Electricity strains ‘manageable’ but risks remain as mercury soars, Aemo says As we flagged last week, the arrival of sustained days of heat for eastern Australia (especially around Sydney) had authorities scrambling to make sure electricity supplies would suffice. The Australian Energy Market Operator has followed its usual procedure of sending out alerts and seeking a market response. What was unusual was the series of so-called level 3 lack of reserve notes for NSW, which implied the potential for blackouts if generators didn’t respond. (Cue some scary headlines.) Anyway, Aemo has issued a statement lately stating that “based on current forecast conditions”, they reckon reserves “are manageable” in NSW today despite the mercury climbing. (Parts of western Sydney are nudging 35C just now.) Still, Aemo doesn’t want to imply complacency: [Ongoing] heatwave conditions combined with significant generation outages in NSW tomorrow and Thursday remain a risk. Additional measures may be necessary if supply forecasts worsen due to unexpected generation or transmission outages, or if demand rises beyond current expectations. Nobody is being asked to reduce consumption – but for the sake of the planet (and our pockets) – why waste energy? Meanwhile, for Queensland “currently reserves are forecast to be manageable for tomorrow and Thursday”. Shorten said he thinks federal election is ‘winnable’ for Labor Bill Shorten also spoke about this morning’s caucus meeting, which will be his last – as he retired from politics next year to take up the role of vice chancellor at the University of Canberra. He told Sky News he has attended about 400 in his 17 years in politics. You know, they have on the wall pictures of all the former leaders. And I said, the only way that someone gets to have their picture on the wall is because of the faces in the room. And the Labor party, what it has, when … all the chips are down, is we have to learn to stick together. Shorten said he thinks the election is “winnable” but “it’s a contest.” What we think about when we get up in the morning as the government is ‘how do we help everyday Aussies?’. I think the opposition hasn’t done enough homework on their policy other than that sort of bizarre Soviet Union nuclear policy. Shorten lashes Greens over housing debacle Bill Shorten was also asked about the Greens’ backdown on its housing concessions – a rent freeze and negative gearing changes – to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy bill. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said earlier (see post) the party would wave Labor’s housing bills through and return to its fight at the next election. Speaking to Sky News, Shorten said he was pleased the bill was passed with a bit of “momentum” during the last week of parliament this year. The Greens have really, in my opinion, lost the plot. They have just been oppositionalist, and they’ve made the perfect the enemy of the good. I think the Greens think that, if they can sabotage Labor, then they can harvest our vote and say, ‘we should be the only really fair dinkum people because we’re so pure’. He argued the Greens’ “opposition mentality” was “turning people off”. Shorten says path to make NDIS long-term is ‘making sure we’re paying for outcomes’ The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has been speaking to Sky News about the NDIS. Speaking about art and music therapy funded through the scheme, he said “we are asking for some outcome for the dollars”. The path to making the scheme long term is to make sure that we’re paying for outcomes … What we want to do is focus on the participant. So this is a classic example. I like music therapy, I’ve seen it work where it demonstrates … it’s maintaining or improving highly disabled people’s functional capability. Great, keep charging. But if it’s something more as an activity, you can still charge at $68 bucks an hour, and if you’re getting four people in your class doing music or doing painting, $193 bucks, which is, I think, reasonable. Queensland opposition leader makes impassioned plea to government over truth-telling inquiry The Queensland opposition leader, Steven Miles, has made an impassioned plea to the government not to cancel the state’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry. Most of the Labor frontbench attended a rally outside parliament, for the first sitting day of the new government. Miles said the government was “refusing to listen” by ending the inquiry. I think that is a real shame. But the commitment I make to you, though, is that if you succeed, if you get your meeting, if you change his mind, if the truth-telling inquiry continues, then there will be nothing but praise from us. We will not criticise him [Crisafulli]. In fact, we will welcome it, because the truth is more important than politics and more important than point-scoring. The shadow minister for Closing the Gap and reconciliation, Leanne Enoch, also spoke at the rally and said: There is nothing to be afraid of in telling the truth. What is there to be afraid of? The data, the history, the evidence? There’s nothing to be afraid of. Truth-telling has happened all over the world, all over the world. Why can’t it happen here? Why can’t it happen here? The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, dismissed the protests this morning: There might be 150 protesters, but 5 million Queenslanders passed a vote on the 26th of October for the government to scrap [the path to a] treaty, and we have a mandate, and that’s what we’re going to do. He said the government could introduce repeal legislation as early as this week. LinkedIn tells parliamentary committee it is not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use it If you’re a social media platform trying to avoid having to verify the ages of your users, you might consider trying what LinkedIn has told a parliamentary committee: we’re not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use us. A few people on social media noticed a couple of months ago that one of the campaigns calling for the ban for under-16s had included the LinkedIn logo among the usual suspects of social media sites as an odd addition. LinkedIn has now told the parliament that it is definitely not a site teenagers want to use as it is “entirely professional” and “not popular with minors”. Additionally, LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors. As noted above, it is entirely professionally focused, providing members the ability to connect and engage on topics relevant to the world of work. Unsurprisingly, therefore, LinkedIn does not direct or market any of its products or features toward minors – including the 16 and 17-year-olds that are technically permitted on the platform – through content, design, marketing, or advertising. Human Rights Law Centre says under-16 social media ban bill raises constitutional concerns The Australian Human Rights Law Centre has said the bill to ban social media for under-16s raises constitutional concerns. In a submission, the centre says while not having sufficient time to fully consider the potential constitutional implications, “on its face, the bill burdens the implied freedom of political communication protected by the Australian constitution.” It imposes a blanket prohibition on those under 16 from accessing various social media platforms. In the modern era, social media platforms are one of the primary tools for political communication. It is likely to also burden the ability of all people in Australia to communicate, by potentially requiring any user of a social media platform to undertake age verification. Those over 16 may have legitimate reasons for being concerned about consenting to age verification. There are real questions about whether such a burden is proportionate to the purpose of protecting children from online harm. We would encourage the committee to seek further input regarding the constitutional validity of the Bill. The centre is one of many of the submissions to the inquiry recommending against the bill being passed in its current form. Elon Musk’s X also yesterday said there were questions around the lawfulness of the bill. More information on Victorian anti-vilification bill Just circling back to the earlier news that Victorian Labor would introduce an anti-vilification bill to the state parliament today: The state attorney general Jaclyn Symes says the bill retains current exceptions in the law that protect activities done for genuine religious, academic, artistic, public interest or scientific reasons. It also protects people “genuine and legitimate religious activities, such as worshipping, practising, proselytising and teaching religion”. She said: We want to make it clear that what you believe … what you what your religion stands for, is unaffected by this bill. It can’t be used as a cloak for unabated abuse. But in relation to what people believe, what they talk about, what they teach. Religion is important. Your ability to practice your religion free of hate is protected in this bill. The bill also introduces a new “political expression” defence for the criminal incitement offence, to protect political communication. Greens still negotiating with government over Nature Positive environmental legislation On the issue of legislation still stalled in the Senate, and as the clock is ticking on the end of the parliamentary year, the Greens are still negotiating with the government over its Nature Positive environmental legislation after dropping their demand that climate impact be included among the assessments for development projects. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, had talks with minister Tanya Plibersek yesterday but they have not yet reached a compromise. It is likely there will be further talks today as the government seeks to clear its legislative logjam. Australia and China have ‘interdependent’ economies: Chinese ambassador Back at his press conference, the Chinese ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian has described the economies of each country as “interdependent”. He said: We are two big economies. We are so much – let me use the word – interdependent. I don’t think it’s a negative word. The Chinese and Australian economies are strongly connected with each other. Our two economies are interwoven with each other. In a certain sense … we are interdependent with each other. China is the major importer from Australia, and Australia relies on China as its biggest market. And no other country can single-handedly take the place of China in this respect. And we do not see any other country can take the place of Australia. So we have confidence that, as we manage our relationship, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship. Labor has held its last caucus meeting for the parliamentary year. Anthony Albanese thanked a number of MPs and senators: Michelle Ananda-Rajah, whose seat of Higgins is being abolished but is contesting the Senate at the number 3 spot; senator Anne Urquhart, who is contesting the lower house seat of Braddon; Brian Mitchell, who stood aside to let former Tasmanian opposition leader Rebecca White run in Lyons; and Catryna Bilyk, who is retiring. Albanese noted the Greens had changed their position on Labor’s housing bills, saying their party had “folded in on itself” and this is “hopefully the first of many” bills to be passed this week. He took aim at Peter Dutton, for opposing government bills to prevent privatisation of the NBN, introduce a power to cap student numbers, and extend free Tafe. The prime minister said he would leave “nothing on the field” when it came to ensuring Labor stayed in majority government after the next election. On the social media age ban, communications minister Michelle Rowland said it was important to know that social media companies cannot compel people to hand over their ID. She noted while it is good that opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is on board it was concerning that their party room was split. A long list of legislation was approved: on authorising surcharges charged by commonwealth entities; the Future Made in Australia production tax credits; and the migration prohibited items bill. Chinese ambassador: ‘No reason for us to compromise our respective national interests’ Does Xiao Qian have any concerns that Donald Trump’s election in the US will alter or undermine the stabilised Australia-China relationship? He responded that “there is no reason for us to compromise our respective national interests for the sake of a third party.” We are responsible for our own people, the Australian government is responsible for Australian people. We have common ground and this has been the foundation for a good relationship over the decades, bringing so many benefits to our two countries and peoples and there are reasons to responsibly manage our relationship bilaterally so our people can benefit. On the US, as he mentioned a moment ago, the ambassador said “we are still in a transition period … so perhaps we need to be a little patient until the new administration comes into office … to see what bilaterally we can do between China and the US”. Ambassador says China respects ‘the choice of the American people’ Xiao Qian was asked about the incoming Donald Trump administration, and how this may impact trade. He said China “respect[s] the choice of the American people”, and the relationship between China and the US “is now in transition”, with Biden and Xi meting on the sidelines of Apec. Bilaterally, as ambassador in Australia, what I can say at this moment is I expect China and the United States to engage with each other to talk about each other’s policies on how to manage our relationship … at the proper time for them when the new administration comes into office in January. Asked about the Australia-China relationship, Xiao Qian said “we are in a very good shape – also at a very critical period of time”. We experienced a difficult time for several years until two years ago and since then we have been successfully changing that situation. The year of 2022 was a year of stabilisation. President Xi [Jinping] met with prime minister Anthony Albanese, they agreed to define the relationship … And the year of 2023 was a year of immense improvement, a lot of bilateral meetings … dialogues and consultations. That year was highlighted by prime minister Albanese’s visit to China. He said that 2024 has been a year of “consolidation” and “symbolised a complete turnaround of the relationship”. With efforts from both sides we have successfully turned around the relationship through the two years … Looking forward into the future, we are expecting – at least I am expecting – a move beyond stabilisation, moving further into development because we have so many areas that we share, contributing to the fundamental interests of our two countries. Chinese ambassador calls for Australia to support ‘One China’ policy The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has been speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in Canberra. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a province of China … I hope the Australian side would respect China’s sovereignty and practice its commitment of the One China policy in words and deeds, and to support openly the peaceful reunification of China. Rabbi welcomes new anti-vilification laws in Victoria Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann has welcomed the laws, describing today as a “great day for all Victorians”. It doesn’t matter whether you wear a kippa or a hijab, if someone vilifies you, if someone wants to go after you, your faith, your background, your belief, your sexuality, the chances are that they will be charged and go to jail or be heavily fined. We all become safer. Sadly, what we have seen on the streets the CBD and around Victoria is people feeling emboldened lately to go after minority groups to go after Jews, to go after people from the Islamic community, members of the LGBTQI+ community, people with a disability – they feel that they can get away with vilifying bigotry, racism, all types of phobias. Today the Allan government says enough is enough. He is urging other religious leaders to support the reforms, and said: There’s been a little bit of chatter about the religious community. I’m an orthodox rabbi. I teach the Hebrew Bible scripture. I know the different nuances within it, but I also know that as a religious person, someone with fundamental beliefs, that we are all equal in the eyes of God. We all created in the image of God, and that means honouring, respecting people, of people, religion, beliefs, sexualities and the like. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the bill has been years in the making, and that she’s undergone significant consultation with the community over two years: These laws are for the Muslim woman who told me she was scared to get on public transport because she was wearing hijab … These laws are for the parents of Jewish kids, who are not allowed to come into the CBD anymore because they are scared that when they wearing their uniform or they have a Star of David necklace or a kippa on, because their parents are scared they attacked because of the rising antisemitism. These laws for the young man who told me, because he’s queer, he has to take time out from school because he’s viciously bullied because of who he is and what he looks like. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that will be introduced to parliament today. There are plenty of details in the bill, but the main element will be to expand the state’s existing legal protections against vilification – which currently only cover race and religion – to cover disability, gender identity, sex and sexual orientation. It also protects people with a personal association with a person who has a protected attribute, such as being the parent of a disabled child. The bill will also create two criminal offences to be contained in the Crimes Act, to respond to serious vilification: It will be an offence to incite hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group based on their protected attribute. It will be an offence to threaten physical harm or property damage against a person or a group based on their protected attribute. They will apply when incitement or threats occur in Victoria in any context – private, public or online. Party room meetings taking place Party room meetings have been taking place this morning in Parliament House. They are held every Tuesday during sitting weeks, and with so much legislation left to address and only three sitting days left, they could prove quite important. There’s an off-the-record briefing after each party room meeting, and my colleagues here in Canberra will bring us the key takeaways as we learn more. Circling back to news that the Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight: O’Brien is holding a press conference at state parliament after being selected as Victoria Nationals leader, saying the party would retain “our laser-like focus on the interests of rural and regional Victoria going forward.” Particularly at the moment when we’ve got a terrible government that is very city centric and focused on the urban areas, at the expense of rural and regional Victoria. After the 2022 election, O’Brien said his party should review its agreement with the Liberals. But today, he said the Coalition was strong: The Coalition remains very strong and will continue to remain very strong under my leadership. John Pesutto is doing a fantastic job in turning around the fortunes of the opposition and making sure that come 2026 that Victorians will have a strong alternative to the current terrible Labor government. And I’m very pleased and very strongly committed to ensuring that that Coalition continues to ensure that we get rid of this very bad Labor government. Asked what would happen to the agreement if the Liberals decide to dump Pesutto as Liberal leader, O’Brien dismissed the question as a hypothetical. He confirmed his predecessor, Peter Walsh, will step down from his shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs but said the party’s position on treaty wouldn’t change. O’Brien said there would be a shuffle of portfolios shortly, with upper house MP Melina Bath to be elevated to shadow cabinet. It’s just the first sitting day of Queensland’s new Liberal National government. But as new MPs are sworn in inside the parliament building, hundreds of protestors have rallied outside. Signs demand the government abandon its plans to repeal a plan to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous Queenslanders and end an inquiry into colonialism. One sign reads: What are you afraid of? The truth? Most of the frontbench of the Labor opposition is attending, including opposition leader Steven Miles. Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Green to debate housing at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, will debate at the National Press Club today. And it might actually be a debate now the Greens have decided to pass Labor’s housing bills (which the Coalition oppose). In an advance copy of Sukkar’s speech, the shadow minister is long on the problems in the housing market but a bit shorter on the solutions. On the problems, he says: First home buyer loans have plummeted from 171,218 in 2020–21 under the Coalition to just 108,599 in 2022–23. Home completions dropped to 177,185 last year—40,000 fewer than the 216,707 under the Coalition in 2016–17. Approvals for new homes have also crashed, falling to 167,287 over the past year, compared to 233,247 when the Coalition was in government. Meanwhile, national median rents have skyrocketed by 23%, reaching $632 per week from $512 in May 2022. Labor’s promise to build 1.2m homes over five years will never see the light of day, with industry experts predicting a shortfall of over 400,000 homes. On solutions, Sukkar promises: a “a comprehensive package” to tackle barriers to getting a loan to “make homeownership more achievable for all Australians”; a $5bn fund for enabling infrastructure; and a freeze on changes to the national construction code. He will conclude: Australians can continue to expect a Coalition government will be singularly focussed on home ownership. We are the only party that still believes in the Australian Dream, which is why the individual, not the institution, is the centre of our focus. We are the only party fighting for the Dream because home ownership has always been a Liberal value and something Labor has never signed up to. Australians deserve action, not spin, and housing - without a doubt - will be a defining issue at the next election. ‘Silent majority’ of Australian farmers found to support renewable energy transition Seventy per cent of regional Australians in renewable energy zones support the development of renewable energy projects on local farmland, a new survey has found. The survey, conducted for lobby group Farmers for Climate Action, found that support for renewable energy developments increased to 73% for people connected to the farming industry, but was conditional on concerns around consultation, project design and decommissioning being met. Just 17% of respondents said they opposed renewable energy developments, with 8% strongly opposed. For more details on the survey, you can read our full report below: Human Rights Commission to launch its anti-racism framework today This evening, the Australian Human Rights Commission will launch what it’s calling “the most comprehensive plan ever for addressing racism” in Australia. The anti-racism framework will “provide a roadmap for governments, business and community organisations to eliminate racism in Australia in all its forms”, it said in a statement. The framework has been developed with funding from the Australian government, and will be launched by Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman in Western Sydney this evening. University vice-chancellors face pay scrutiny The Australian is reporting that university vice-chancellors could have their pay pegged to other public servants’. That would no doubt be music to the ears of struggling students and the National Tertiary Education Union, but sadly the effect of upcoming governance reforms might have been slightly overstated. In April, education ministers agreed to set up an expert governance council for universities. One of its 10 priorities is to: Demonstrate and maintain a rigorous and transparent process for developing remuneration policies and settings for senior university staff, with consideration given to comparable scale and complexity public sector entities, and ensure remuneration policies and packages are publicly reported. As far as we can tell this might mean that there is more scrutiny on pay, but as long as universities have policies, consider the relativity of pay and are transparent in the way pay is set, they are largely free to continue giving generous remuneration. Nevertheless, perhaps modest pay could catch on. After all, the Western Sydney University vice-chancellor George Williams took a 20-25% pay cut relative to his predecessor and government services minister, Bill Shorten, has asked to be paid less than $1m when he starts his new gig at the University of Canberra. Victorian gaming minister outlines changes to state’s poker machine rules The Victorian gaming minister, Melissa Horne, has just run through the changes she will be introducing to parliament today to set up mandatory carded play on poker machines. Speaking outside parliament, she said $3bn was lost by Victorians every year through poker machines: But at the same time, we’ve got less than 10% of the population playing poker machines. This is less people than ever before but they’re losing more than ever before. And where people are losing the most money is in our lowest socio economic areas. So there’s something wrong. Horne said carded play will begin with a pilot at 40 pubs and clubs across the state in the middle of next year, before it is rolled out in 2026. She says it will become mandatory across all venues by 2027. So next year, it’s about doing the pilot and then evaluating the technology. Because unlike Crown casino, which is a single venue that’s got the same technology, we’ve got more than 500 different venues across the state, and the technology varies from machine to machine. We’re making sure that we get that technology piece right so that it’s easy for people to sign up to – that’s really important. But it’s the pilot next year then over 2026 is rolling out the card at play then this mandatory by 2027 which lines up with the new monitoring licence. The Australian Human Rights Commission has said the bill to ban under-16s from social media should not pass in its current form. The commission said while there are online harms and social media can have a negative impact, it provides opportunities for children and young people to access criticall potentially life-saving information and to share ideas and opinions. Social media also offers children and young people opportunities for inclusion and participation that are particularly important for children and young people from marginalised, vulnerable or remote communities, including children with complex needs and disability. The ban would have unintended consequences and negative human rights impacts, the commission said, not just for children and young people but the broader Australian community. Given the importance of this issue, the risks around negatively impacting children and young people’s rights and the unreasonable timeframes for analysing and commenting on the bill, the bill should not be passed in its current form. SQM Research has released its annual housing update that says Sydney and Melbourne housing prices are likely to continue to record moderate price falls of between -1% and -5%. The base forecast for average national dwelling prices is expected to rise between +1% to +4%. Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin are expected to outperform the national housing market, it found, with Perth forecast to record the fastest dwelling price rises of between 14% to 19%. Meanwhile, Canberra is due to record the largest falls in dwelling prices of between -6% to -2%. SQM Research is also forecasting an interest rate cut between 0.25% and 0.50% over mid 2025 – which it says would “immediately stimulate homebuyer demand across the country [and] limit the year-on-year dwelling prices falls recorded for our two largest capital cities.” Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said: To be sure, our two largest capital cities, along with Canberra and Hobart will start 2025 off in the red. Indeed, we are currently recording dwelling price falls in each of these cities … However, once interest rate cuts do occur, we are expecting a speedy bounce in demand for Sydney and Melbourne in particular, which both are still experiencing underlying housing shortage relative to the strong population growth rates … However, if I am wrong and rate cuts do not occur in 2025, it is unlikely a recovery will occur in Sydney and Melbourne at any time next year. Previous coverage on the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women There’s been a fair bit of talk this morning about the government’s response to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, has covered this inquiry extensively over the past three years. In August, when the inquiry’s report was handed down, she spoke with the Full Story podcast about the need for reform: And you can have a read of all our previous articles on this topic here. The sports minister, Anika Wells, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning about gambling reform. (You can read her earlier comments to ABC RN about this, here). Wells was asked why the government has acted so quickly on the under-16 social media ban, but not on gambling reform? She responded: The social media ban is about trying to protect kids as quickly as we can, and also to give parents the tools to empower them in conversations. It’s a lot easier to say to your kids, ‘The government has said that they can’t guarantee you’re safe online, that’s why you and your friends are not allowed to go on the platforms anymore.’ Gambling advertising has financial impacts for professional codes, national sporting organisations, impacts to us with respect to sporting integrity on the world stage and what we do on the world stage. She was asked: doesn’t gambling have just as many consequences for young people and their mental health when they get caught up in these addictions? Wells responded by pointing to action the government has already taken. NT authorities need to take domestic violence ‘more seriously’, Nampijinpa Price says The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier about the NT coroner’s inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women. Asked for her reflections on what the coroner found, Price told the program: There has been a desensitisation from the coroner towards the rates of domestic and family violence that we certainly experience in the Northern Territory, and this has occurred over some time now. I also feel as though there is an attitude in … dealing with family violence and interpersonal violence in Indigenous communities that it is in some way, you know, taboo to have an open and honest conversation about the fact that we experience the high rates, so as not to demonise our men. Price argued there was a “need for our authorities and police force to tackle it more seriously”, and that calls to remove police from communities wasn’t helpful. I have faith in the Country Liberal party government to be able to deliver on those recommendations, and with that funding that’s available. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. The party met this morning to vote O’Brien in as leader, with Lowan MP Emma Kealy to remain deputy leader. O’Brien said in a statement following the vote: It is the greatest honour to have been elected as leader of The Nationals. For over 100 years, The Nationals have served the interests of rural and regional Victoria. That will not change. It remains our singular focus as the only party solely dedicated to serving the interests of the 25% of the population who live outside the metropolitan area. Walsh had been in the leadership role for a decade and it remains unclear whether he will stick around on the backbench. The Greens’ housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather spoke with ABC RN earlier, about the party’s backdown on its concessions on the Help to Buy legislation. He argued the Greens were “really close” to achieving its concessions around a rent freeze and negative gearing changes, and that the government “were actively considering it”. It is bitterly disappointing that Labor, in the end, blinked and didn’t decide to come to that policy. But I haven’t lost hope, because I think we can go to the next election with those policies, and I think we can push Labor after that next election. Is this an act of electoral self-preservation? Chandler-Mather disagreed, and echoed comments from party leader Adam Bandt earlier that “it comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can.” I would point out that we have now passed every single bit of Labor’s housing legislation this term of parliament. We have tried to negotiate and secure good outcomes. Chandler-Mather is due to speak at the National Press Club in Canberra today, alongside shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar. TikTok has warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a “licence to be online” because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The company’s director of public policy in Australia, Ella Woods-Joyce, pointed to comments made by the communications department in Senate estimates earlier this month confirming that “everybody will have to go through an age verification process”. As the government’s admissions in Budget Estimates make clear, age-restricted social media platforms will need to undertake age assurance for each and every Australian user in order to remove age-restricted users from their services. This effectively creates a mechanism whereby Australians need a ‘licence to be online’. Woods-Joyce said there are many questions about the trial of the age assurance technology, which won’t be completed before the government pushes to pass the bill. Given the impact of mandating that all Australians who wish to use social media platforms be subject to such an age assurance system, we urge Parliament to consider the broader implications of legislating such an outcome without knowing any details of the system itself. We’re getting more submissions to the one-day inquiry on the bill, up to 93 out of the more than 15,000 submissions now public. You can read more of the submissions below. Rishworth says Coalition opposition to social media ban ‘all about politics’ The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has taken aim at those in the opposition speaking against the under-16s social media ban. Earlier in the blog, we brought you her comments that this was a leadership test for Peter Dutton, as people in the party ‘defy’ him. Speaking at a doorstop at Parliament House, Rishworth was asked whether the government will allow amendments if the Coalition moves that passports and licenses can’t be requested for ID. She responded: Of course, we want to work across the board to make sure that there is strong privacy protections in place. But quite frankly, this seems to me like this is all about politics and about negativity. Now I shouldn’t have been surprised. This is not the first time that Peter Dutton has said he supports something and then has decided to destroy. The Labor party is trying to build, while he has become a blocker. So I shouldn’t be surprised that he says he 100% supports something, wants to see it delivered, and then decides to block it and play politics with it. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, spoke to ABC News Breakfast earlier about Labor’s housing legislation and said “there comes a point where you’ve pushed as hard as you can”. He was asked whether the Greens’ backdown on its concessions around rent freezes and negative gearing was “humiliating”, and responded: We tried really hard to get Labor to act on soaring rent increases and unfair tax handouts that are tilting the playing field against first-home buyers, but we couldn’t get there this time. Bandt argued that the Greens “led the charge” on the stage-three tax cuts and were “hopeful” they could get the government to shift on key housing measures: We got close. The government was costing changes to negative gearing and they decided to back down at the last minute, and that’s disappointing. But, look, there comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can. The government’s made its decision about defending the status quo. What we’ll now do is wave the bills through, and take this challenge up to the next election … I’m hopeful that, in the next parliament, if we keep Peter Dutton out, we can push the government to make some much-needed reforms. Albanese government announces panel members for review of national electricity market As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid faces a couple of days of strains in New South Wales and Queensland as power demand picks up along with temperatures. (About 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plant capacity is offline for maintenance too, which isn’t helping.) Anyway, the Albanese government is looking a bit over the horizon, announcing the panel members for a post-2030 review of the national electricity market (basically all of Australia save the NT and WA grids). The review will be chaired by Tim Nelson, a former AGL Energy expert. He’ll be joined by Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Ava Hancock, who helped designs NSW’s renewable energy roadmap, and Phil Hirschhorn, who was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. The terms of reference of the review will be key but the details are apparently scant on that front. The federal and state energy ministers may fill in some of the blanks when they meet (some in person, some virtually) for their final gathering of 2024 at the end of next week. The panel will examine the wholesale market settings “to ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond”, the office of energy minister Chris Bowen said. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system. The results of the review are likely to land after next year’s federal election – let’s see if Bowen will lead the charge of implementing its recommendations. McCarthy calls for change in how media reports on First Nation deaths On the media’s role in covering the deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, Malarndirri McCarthy said the Senate inquiry heard that “First Nations families felt they weren’t believed, felt they weren’t heard, and felt that they were completely ignored”. This must change. I’ve certainly written to the Australian Press Council. I’ll be calling on fellow senators to assist me with media across the country. There has to be a change in the culture of the media, in the reporting, in the way it’s reported. Government notes ‘large number’ of recommendations from inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women Going back to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women – which the government responded to late last night – Malarndirri McCarthy told the program the government had “noted a large number of the recommendations”. What I’ll continue to do is meet with those Indigenous affairs ministers, as I’ve done recently, to ensure that we continue to keep working in this space. McCarthy said they had advertised for a Children’s Commissioner for First Nations youth and children, and “we hope to have that up and running in January.” Host Bridget Brennan said she had heard responses on two recommendations, but the government had “noted” eight others – what does it mean, will the government be looking at enacting them? McCarthy responded: For example, when we look at the jurisdictions around police – well, of course that will be up to the attorney general to work at the state level with the police jurisdictions. It will be up to each of those jurisdictions to then follow through. We can’t enforce it. But we can make sure we have those conversations. So it doesn’t mean we don’t agree, is what I’m saying. McCarthy urges NT government to act after inquest into four Indigenous deaths Yesterday, the Northern Territory government has been told it must overhaul its response to family violence to stop women and children being killed. As Nino Bucci reported, the NT coroner yesterday handed down inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, making 35 recommendations: The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss this, and said it was an “important moment” for the NT and Australia to “realise that this is a national scourge that we have across our country.” She called on the NT government to “immediately” release funding to address the recommendations. This is too critical. We know that, from a federal perspective, that there was a requirement to assist the family and domestic violence sector in the Northern Territory. And I urge the Northern Territory government to do that immediately. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was on ABC RN earlier to discuss the rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women – after the government handed down its response to the Senate inquiry yesterday. McCarthy labelled the findings “horrific” – with Indigenous women making up 16% of Australia’s murder victims, while being just 2-3% of the adult population. There is something in the system in Australia that seems to just go, ‘that’s OK’, you know, but it’s not OK. It’s not OK … People who work in the family and domestic violence sector … break down because they feel that the system isn’t changing. And I do believe that the work of this Senate inquiry has certainly brought it to the forefront for the Australian parliament, to the point where the Australian prime minister brought all the premiers and chief ministers together to say enough … at the national level. McCarthy said there would “always be an expectation for more to be done”, and that state and territory’s will be tasked to take things back to their cabinets to work on. Sports minister on gambling ad reform: government ‘remains committed’ to all 31 recommendations Labor’s plans for gambling ad reform has been delayed until next year – despite commitments made from the minister there would be a response by Christmas. Josh Butler had more on the timeline of this in yesterday’s blog, here. The aged care and sports minister, Anika Wells, was asked about this on ABC RN earlier, and said the government “remain[ed] committed” to working through the 31 recommendations of the inquiry. Right now, we’re working through 31 recommendations with all of the different stakeholders in this space … As a sport minister who always tries to be athlete-led, there are athletes who are being targeted by the rise of gambling and the proliferation of gambling advertising, not just in professional clothes now, but in the junior leagues we’ve seen those stories come out. So it is something that we’re working through … These are complex but important reforms, and I look forward to continuing to work on them. Wells was asked about the role lobbyists are playing in trying to stop reform – but she said “I wouldn’t characterise it that way at all.” I think, and if you look at the public remarks that codes have made along this journey, they agree that something needs to be done. It’s about finding something that’s workable, that everybody can live with, and that won’t impact the financial models … Peter V’landys absolutely is one of the players in this area, but there’s lots more, and we’ve got to work through the nuances and concerns of all of them, and that’s why we’re going to continue to do that. On the under-16s social media ban, we’ve now got at least three Nationals – Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and now Bridget McKenzie – and Liberal MP Garth Hamilton publicly voicing concerns over the rushed nature of the bill and potential privacy or access issues for all Australians. The Coalition partyroom is meeting this morning, where the ban is expected to be a hot topic of conversation. But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said at a brief press gallery doorstop that he was in favour of the ban broadly, and indicated most of the Coalition still backed it: I think the process is troubling, and there are issues here, but ultimately, we think that this is a proportionate approach to what is a very serious issue in the community. This is something that Peter [Dutton] has given very lengthy comments on the record about, and that is our position. The report of the lightning-quick inquiry, which only held a short three-hour hearing, will be released this afternoon. We hear there may be more than a few amendments to the bill proposed. However even critics of the bill are expecting the Coalition will ultimately back the ban. Watch this space. Hot days to strain eastern Australia’s power grid for next few days The slow-moving heatwave across southern and south-eastern Australia will nudge temperatures in Sydney’s west towards 40C today and tomorrow. Sydney’s eastern suburbs will be spared the worst, though, with sea breezes keeping the mercury to temperatures in the low 30s for the next three days. Most of eastern New South Wales will endure low- to severe-intensity heatwave conditions today. NSW’s power grid faces the most strain, although Queensland too will have periods when reserves will be relatively tight. (That is, better not have any unplanned outages at the ageing coal-fired power plants ... or any generators for that matter.) The Australian Energy Market Operator this morning cancelled the latest of its so-called lack of reserve level 3 alerts (this one for Wednesday), which imply blackouts unless the market responds. (The market usually responds.) Still, wholesale power prices will near their maximum levels in NSW later today on present Aemo forecasts: A couple of nervous days ahead for our power authorities. And if you’re feeling the heat, drink lots of water, find a cool place and look out for your neighbours to ensure they’re doing OK too. Canavan says he is drafting amendments to under-16 social media bill Despite his pushback to the under-16s social media ban bill, Matt Canavan told ABC RN he hadn’t made his mind up yet on whether he would support the legislation. I’m going to obviously talk to my colleagues in the party room this morning. I am in the process of drafting a number of amendments to the bill, and I’ll have more to say about that in the committee’s report, which will be tabled today. I’ll just keep watching and listening to the debate, but I certainly think the bill needs major changes, and regardless of the changes, I remain unimpressed with this condensed timeframe to analyse the bill. Canavan said there was “widespread support” for legislation like this, and “I don’t think that support is going to somehow disappear over the summer break”. We can I think just pause here, come back and do this properly. Canavan concerned about digital ID for age assurance: ‘All we’ve got is the minister’s word’ The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has said a digital ID framework would not be used for age assurance – does this response alleviate Matt Canavan’s privacy concerns? Canavan argued there was nothing to stop the future use of digital identity to maintain social media accounts: So all we’ve got is the minister’s word, which, as I say, doesn’t mean anything. She might not be the minister within a year – who knows? So why not, if the minister is is being legitimate here … why not just change the act, change the bill to rule it out? He again took aim at the rushed process, saying senators hadn’t “been able to get across some important submissions” and that it would have been good to have social media companies themselves front the inquiry: We only had time yesterday to hear from their industry representative body but many colleagues of mine – including those who support the bill – are frustrated that the industry group could not answer their questions because their questions went to the particular behaviours of the likes of X or Meta … The bill doesn’t even come into effect until 2026, next year. So why not take a breath, extend the inquiry [and] allow us to get across these 15,000 submissions. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan is speaking with ABC RN about the government’s under-16 social media ban. He’s been an outspoken critic against the bill, and told the program “it’s just not acceptable” how rushed it has been. I completely understand the need [to address] significant harms done to young children from the overuse and abuse of social media, but given [that a bill of this kind is] unprecedented it’s just not acceptable to the public. He said the hurried inquiry into the bill received 15,000 submissions and the committee would report today. It’s very important to let people know this … won’t just affect the use of social media for people under 16, because once you have to try and verify someone’s age under 16 you’re going to have to verify everyone’s age to check their age. And so there’s huge privacy, free speech implications of this legislation. O’Neil says government doing ‘everything we can’ to ease economic pressures Asked about the latest economic outlook, Clare O’Neil said she wasn’t denying how tough it is for Australians, and said: You’re seeing the same problems with the economies in the US and all over the world. She pointed to tax cuts and energy bill relief: I’m not saying any of these things completely take the pain away, but I want people to know that government is on your side. We’re doing everything we can to try to relieve those [real] pressures that you’re feeling. Rent freeze and negative gearing changes ‘dead in the water’, O’Neil says The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, just spoke with the Today show about Labor’s housing bills – and the Greens’ decision to back its Help to Buy bill after failing to win its concessions. O’Neil said that the Greens’ calls for a rent freeze and negative gearing changes are “absolutely dead in the water, because they were never good ideas to begin with”. We have sought to be really constructive in this parliament, but it turns out you’ve got to push pretty hard to get your housing initiatives through. O’Neil said the bill was “not a silver bullet” but it was “never meant to be”, but warned people against “the snake oil salesmen in this housing debate who are pretending that there’s one thing we can do to fix the whole problem”. The truth is, we’ve had a generations-in-the-making housing crisis in our country that’s been building for more than 30 years, and it requires our government to do lots of things differently. We’re trying to build many more homes in our country, we’re trying to get a better deal for renters, and we’re trying to get more Australians into homeownership. It’s a big, complex program and it’s going to take some time. But I really want your viewers at home to know that we understand that Australians are in real housing distress at the moment, and our government is stepping up and taking action. ‘We can do better than that’: Zoe Daniel on Labor’s social media ban bill Zoe Daniel argued that the problem with Labor’s social media is that “you’re basically letting the platforms off the hook”. [We need to] get the platforms to take responsibility for what is in their environment – and actually, it would make an age ban redundant if we were to put in this kind of safety by design, and a duty of care and hold the platforms accountable for what’s happening in their spaces. You wouldn’t actually need an age ban. Daniel said she had spoken with communications minister Michelle Rowland about the issue, and the government has flagged it would “go down the track of a duty of care eventually”. The independent MP said she “understood” why the government was pursuing the age ban “because it is a lever to pull now and it makes parents feel better”, but argued it “actually makes zero difference to what is happening on the platforms”. The onus and the responsibility remains on the parents and the kids, and I think that we can do better than that. The independent MP Zoe Daniel was on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss her alternative to the under-16 social media ban, which she introduced as a private member’s bill yesterday. Daniel said her bill would implement an overarching statutory duty of care on social media companies “that goes to safety by design – but that in and of itself is not enough”. What you need to make that work is the companies to assess the risks, mitigate the risks, be transparent about how they’re doing that. The bill builds in penalties so if the companies do not comply, they could be fined up to 10% of global revenue. Also, their onshore executives could be held accountable for that … and the bill also has a provision to enable users to have control over the algorithm, as exists overseas, particularly in the EU … The final provision is that when you enter a social media platform for the first time, your default privacy position is defaulted to the strongest possible settings. McKenzie cites privacy concerns over under-16s social media age ban bill Also on the program, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie weighed in on the under-16s social media ban and said “we are very concerned about digital ID laws”. [There are] obviously privacy concerns, and given the government’s had to pull their misinformation [and] disinformation – or their censoring the Australian public – bill from the Senate this week, we want to make sure we get strong, robust laws that don’t damage the [right to] privacy and make compulsory Australians having to have digital IDs. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has also spoken out against the bill, citing privacy concerns. But yesterday, Nationals leader David Littleproud said there was “conflation and confusion” about the bill, and that it was “dangerous to conflate” it with digital ID. You can read his full comments in yesterday’s blog. Amanda Rishworth was also asked about Labor’s under-16 social media age ban and whether the government was rushing this. The social services minister denied this and said the government has bipartisan support – or so they thought: Well, I thought there was bipartisan support … I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, Peter Dutton said he would facilitate this important piece of legislation and support the government. And now we see our senators defying him, I guess. So this is a test for Peter Dutton about his leadership. Labor’s social media age ban is likely to pass, following a rapid three-day inquiry with just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first. However, conservative opposition to the bill has been growing in the lead up to the lower house vote: Rishworth defends government economic decisions amid latest outlook The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, just spoke with the Today show where she defended the government’s handling of the economy amid the latest outlook: We inherited a pretty big economic mess from the Liberal and National party when we came to government, we had inflation with a six in front of it. We inherited a policy from the Liberal party that was deliberately keeping wages low. Listing measures the government has taken, Rishworth pointed to lowering inflation, wages growth, cost of living measures and the stage three tax cuts. She went on to say: The alternative would have been if Peter Dutton was in in the prime minister chair. He’s opposed every single one of these measures and we would be in a real recession right now if he had got his way on so many policy issues. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie was also on the program and argued “Australians are feeling poorer because they actually are poorer under Albanese”. She took aim at government spending, and said this was why “in comparable nations, our numbers are in the toilet comparatively”. Queensland premier David Crisafulli begins first sitting week as premier Queensland’s new premier, David Crisafulli, will be only the second member of the modern Menzies Liberal party to sit in the top chair when he begins his first sitting week today. The “conservative, uniquely agrarian state” has been governed by Labor or Country National premiers for all but 1,000 days since 1860 but now it’s Crisafulli’s turn to show he can deliver on his promises to slash crime. Read our analysis of what lies in store: Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. We’re in the home stretch, with just three days left in the final sitting week of the year. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers, capturing all the action. Let’s get into it. More on that Deloitte report from AAP: ‘The time will come for changes to tax’ The economists were hopeful inflation would keep a lid on election spending sprees, as cost-of-living support eases pain but injects money into the economy – adding to the problem it’s trying to solve. The treasurer has already been managing expectations before the midyear budget update next month. In a speech, Jim Chalmers warned windfalls would be nought but a “sliver” of upgrades clocked in the past few years. Higher commodity prices and a higher tax take from migration and bracket creep have helped the federal government deliver the first two back-to-back surpluses in almost two decades. DAE partner and report co-author Cathryn Lee said the government still deserved credit for banking most of the revenue rather than spending it, especially during a cost-of-living crunch when the community has been calling for support. Yet she said both major political parties had broadly failed to embark on the structural budget repair needed over the past two decades. The time will come for changes to tax. It must. Australia is waving goodbye to budget surpluses and returning abruptly to deficit, facing a $49bn deterioration in the bottom line in forecasts from leading economists, AAP reports. The $15.8bn surplus logged in the last financial year to Deloitte Access Economics’ prediction of a $33.5bn deficit in 2024/25 would amount to largest nominal contraction in the underlying cash balance on record, outside the pandemic. The forecast would also represent a $5.2bn mark down from Treasury predictions made in the May budget. DAE partner and report co-author Stephen Smith said: Worryingly, there is little to suggest that the situation will right itself in the years to come. As well as the well-documented pressures on the public purse from an ageing population, Smith warned global developments – including China’s economic slowdown and Donald Trump’s return to the White House – did not bode well for Australia’s budget position. Should substantial tariffs be slapped on imports into the United States, including at rates of up to 60% of goods from China, Australia’s budget will not be immune given its reliance on commodity prices via company tax receipts. Tensions high outside Melbourne synagogue Tensions ran high outside a synagogue in Melbourne last night as pro-Israel supporters gathered to counter a pro-Palestine protest despite the rally being cancelled, AAP reports. A number of pro-Israel demonstrators rallied outside a popular synagogue even after the planned pro-Palestine protest was formally called off at the 11th hour as organisers cited safety concerns. Despite the cancellation, there was a visible police presence near the synagogue in Caulfield North, in Melbourne’s south-east, where a sea of Israeli flags far outnumbered the Palestinian flags. Specialist police encircled a small group of pro-Palestine supporters in an attempt to keep them from the larger pro-Israel group. The planned demonstration was in response to a planned talk organised by the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council that includes former Israeli justice minister Ayelet Shaked, whose visa into Australia was reportedly rejected. It also comes as Australia’s Palestinian community demands answers after a dentistry student was struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Here’s our story: Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be my colleague Emily Wind to take you through the bulk of the day in Canberra and beyond. Our top story this morning surrounds Labor’s resolve to force the big tech companies to enforce its proposed ban on under-16s’ use of social media after the Silicon Valley heavyweights pushed back against the legislation. Meta said the bill is “inconsistent and ineffective” and that it should be delayed until there is more time to develop age verification technology. The big moment yesterday was the Greens’ acquiescence to the government’s housing bill – a harsh lesson in realpolitik handed to Adam Bandt and Max Chandler-Mather by the prime minister. Tensions were running high on the streets of a Melbourne suburb last night as pro-Israel demonstrators rallied after the threat of a pro-Palestine protest outside a synagogue. More on that soon. And more soon on a report from Deloitte that forecasts the government faces a huge budget deficit, running into the tens of billions.","2024-11-26T07:11:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/nov/26/australia-politics-live-budget-deficit-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-question-time-social-media-ban"
"abortion","Will abortion rights be wound back in Queensland if the LNP wins the election? ","Debate over Queensland’s abortion laws has made headlines ahead of this week’s official start to the state election campaign. With pro-choice groups marching in the streets and billboards warning of an end to safe abortion services, Queenslanders might be forgiven for wondering if abortion rights are on the ballot on 26 October. But is the Liberal National party actually planning to change abortion laws if it wins government? Or is it just a scare campaign led by the incumbent Labor government? Why is abortion an issue in the Queensland election? Over the past week, Labor has been raising concerns about abortion rights in what the opposition claims is a scare campaign. About 100 people, including senior minister Grace Grace, rallied in Brisbane’s King George Square on Friday. They carried pro-choice signs organised by the Queensland Council of Unions calling on people to “put the LNP last” at the October election. “Don’t let LNP end safe access to abortion services,” one sign read. This came after the LNP leader, David Crisafulli, repeatedly ruled out making any changes to the state’s abortion laws. The party still includes members who have previously expressed views opposing abortion. When asked about abortion at a press conference on Thursday, LNP Springwood candidate, Susanna Damianopoulos, said: “That’s is not my focus at the moment, my focus is what the community is telling me, and that’s issues around crime, cost of living health and housing. “I believe that our leader David Crisafulli has been very clear on what the first-term LNP government will do in that space and I respect that.” Is it legal to get an abortion in Queensland? Abortion has been legal in Queensland since 2018, under legislation passed by Labor. The opposition granted its members a conscience vote, but only three LNP MPs – Tim Nicholls, Steve Minnikin and Jann Stuckey – voted for the bill. Stuckey later claimed she was ostracised from the party as a result and left politics in 2020. At the time, Crisafulli and and his deputy, Jarrod Bleijie, both voted against the bill, with the latter making a speech against “killing a baby”. The last people prosecuted in Queensland under its century-old ban were found not guilty in 2010. Are the laws surrounding abortion about to change in Queensland? The government recently passed laws expanding access to abortion services, particularly in regional areas. Nurses and midwives – not just doctors – will be able to prescribe termination medication MS-2 Step. The LNP opposed the legislation, with health spokesperson Ros Bates saying she had “genuine concerns about the safety risks” in regional areas due to a lack of services and education for providers. During the parliamentary debate, veteran LNP MP Fiona Simpson accused Labor of “dogmatic intolerance” towards people who oppose abortion. “That intolerance means that doctors and nurses who may want to exercise their right to conscientious objection … about the sanctity of life will be afraid that they will be demonised in the workforce,” she said at the time. The government will implement the new $42m abortion access plan across the state, with the LNP committing to continue the scheme.","2024-09-30T01:57:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/30/queensland-state-election-abortion-liberal-national-party-policy-leaders-david-crisafulli"
"abortion","Arizona proposal to protect abortion rights in state constitution advances","A proposal to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution of Arizona, a key battleground state in the upcoming US elections, has inched closer to becoming an official ballot measure. On Wednesday, Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition behind the measure, announced that it had turned in more than 800,000 signatures – more than double the amount needed to get the measure on the ballot come November. That’s more signatures than have ever been submitted for a citizen-led ballot measure in Arizona, according to Chris Love, a spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access. “It represents one in five Arizona voters,” Love said. “It’s an amazing feat for us. I think it’s a demonstration of the strength of our campaign and the excitement of Arizona voters to really settle the issue of abortion rights on the ballot in November.” Arizona currently bans most abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy, but the state came close to outlawing almost all abortions earlier this spring. In April, the Arizona supreme court ruled to uphold a law that paved the way for a 1864 near-total abortion ban – passed before Arizona even became a state – to take effect. That controversial decision kicked off a weeks-long battle in the Arizona state legislature, where Republicans hold a one-seat majority in both the state house and senate, as Democratic lawmakers tried to pass a repeal of the 1864 ban. They ultimately succeeded after a handful of Republican legislators broke ranks and voted for the repeal. “Our message has always been the same: pregnant patients deserve the freedom to make their individual and personal healthcare decisions, and especially decisions about abortions, with their families and their healthcare providers,” Love said. “The back-and-forth that just happened with respect to the 1864 ban is a clear demonstration of why we need politicians out of the calculus.” If voters pass the ballot measure, which is officially titled the Arizona Abortion Access Act, it would eliminate the state’s 15-week ban and instead protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, a benchmark that typically occurs at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. It would also allow abortions to take place after fetal viability if a healthcare professional believes the procedure is necessary to protect a pregnant person’s life or physical or mental health. Roughly a dozen states, including Arizona and fellow swing state Nevada, are expected to hold ballot measures over abortion rights in the November elections. Activists in Nebraska and Arkansas are also set to turn in signatures supporting abortion rights ballot measures this week. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago, several states – including traditional Republican strongholds such as Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio – have successfully passed ballot measures to preserve or strengthen abortion rights. Democrats are now hoping that enthusiasm for abortion rights will boost voter turnout and translate to support for their own candidates, particularly as Joe Biden continues to trail Donald Trump in the polls and has faced calls to step down after a devastating debate performance last week. Arizona county election officials now have until 22 August to officially verify the signatures. Part of the reason for turning in so many signatures, Love said, was to counter any efforts to legally challenge the signatures’ legitimacy.","2024-07-03T17:27:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/03/arizona-abortion-rights-constitution"
"abortion","Biggest US abortion rights groups back Kamala Harris as effective messenger","The biggest abortion rights groups in US politics are lining up behind Kamala Harris’s bid for president, a show of faith in a politician who has already become the face of the White House’s fight over abortion rights – which is not only one of the election’s biggest issues but one of the few where Democrats have the advantage. Within hours of Joe Biden’s stunning announcement on Sunday that he would drop out of the presidential race and endorse the vice-president, Emilys List, which champions Democratic women who support abortion rights, and Reproductive Freedom for All, which advocates for abortion access and was previously known as Naral Pro-Choice America, officially endorsed Harris. Emilys List plans to pour at least $20m into the race in support of Harris. Planned Parenthood Action Fund, whose endorsement must be ratified by local chapters, has not officially weighed in. However, its CEO and president, Alexis McGill Johnson, warmly commended Harris for keeping “the needs and experiences of patients and providers front and center”. Harris has spent much of this year on a tour of the country in support of abortion rights, where she has proven to be a far more effective messenger on the issue than Biden. The president was infamously reluctant to even say the word “abortion” and fumbled answers to questions about it in the June debate that ultimately cost him his candidacy. “Just right off the bat, she’s primed to run with the message around abortion rights,” said Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. “Her messaging around abortion and being out there forcefully on the issue is going to be a net positive for her.” Harris, the first sitting vice-president or president to visit an abortion clinic, has described the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade and the abortion bans that now blanket the US south as “a healthcare crisis” and frames abortion rights as an issue of personal freedom. “One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body,” she told a crowd in Savannah, Georgia, in February. Democrats hope that outrage over Roe’s downfall, which hobbled Republicans in the 2022 midterms and led GOP strongholds such as Ohio and Kansas to pass ballot measures protecting abortion rights, will boost turnout among their base – especially in battleground states like Nevada and Arizona. Both states are set to hold abortion–related ballot measures this year. Donald Trump, his running mate, JD Vance, and other Republicans have attempted to neutralize the importance of abortion rights in the 2024 election by downplaying the issue as well as their party’s role in Roe’s demise. During last week’s Republican national convention, the issue was conspicuously missing onstage. Neither Trump, who appointed three of the supreme court justices who overturned Roe, nor Vance, who has previously supported a national abortion ban, mentioned abortion. “Trump and Vance can downplay the abortion message all they want, but the political reality speaks for itself,” said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute. Deckman suspects that a Harris candidacy will invigorate young women, young women of color and suburban women. “We see in our polling that young women in particular are the most staunchly supportive of abortion rights,” Deckman said. “I think it’s gonna be an extremely close election. But I think the benefit for the Democrats is now they have a new narrative. There’s some enthusiasm happening, where there wasn’t with the Biden campaign.” Before Roe fell, anti-abortion Republicans were far more likely than pro-abortion rights Democrats to identify as single-issue abortion voters. That picture has changed somewhat. One in eight voters say abortion is the “most important issue” to their vote, while more than half say that it is “very important issue but not the most important”, according to polling from KFF conducted before Biden’s departure from the race. Two-thirds of the voters who describe abortion as their most important issue say it should be legal in all or most cases. The voters who think it should be legal in all cases tend to be Democratic, Black, female or between the ages of 18 and 29. But voters are also deeply concerned with the economy and immigration – issues where, polls indicate, Trump is seen as the stronger candidate. Although six in 10 Democrats think Harris would make a good president, only about three in 10 overall adults feel the same, according to polling released by the Associated Press on Friday. As vice-president, Harris has backed Biden’s promise to codify abortion rights into law. “Here’s what a second Trump term looks like: more bans, more suffering, less freedom,” Harris said in a May speech. “But we are not going to let that happen.” While abortion rights groups are backing Harris, anti-abortion activists are already mobilizing against her. SBA Pro-Life America, which plans to spend $92m across eight states this election cycle, has started calling Harris “the “abortion czar”.","2024-07-22T19:24:27Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/22/kamala-harris-abortion-rights"
"abortion","How Ted Cruz’s abortion record could cost him a historic election in Texas","The notoriously verbose Ted Cruz has gone largely silent on abortion, one of his favorite topics to legislate on and bloviate about, during his Senate re-election campaign in Texas – an ominous sign both for Cruz and the anti-abortion movement writ large. Indeed, Texas representative Colin Allred has mounted an unusually strong campaign for Cruz’s Senate seat at a time when Texas has become ground zero in the grisly maternal health disaster unfolding across the country since the fall of Roe v Wade. As of the latest University of Houston poll, the race between Cruz and Allred is currently a dead heat, with Cruz leading the former NFL player by only two points (47-45%). This is remarkable for Texas, which hasn’t elected a Democrat in a statewide race in three decades and has never elected a Black US senator. Abortion is a particularly toxic issue for Republicans this presidential election cycle, so much so that even Donald Trump posted after the Democratic national convention that his administration “would be great for women and their reproductive rights”. Cruz had openly celebrated the US supreme court overturning Roe in 2022, calling the decision a “massive victory”. But since Texas women began pouring out personal horror stories and suing the state left and right for denying them emergency abortions under the state’s draconian ban, he’s gone quiet. The senator dodged multiple questions in December about the Texas supreme court denying 31-year-old Kate Cox’s request for an emergency abortion, which forced her to travel out of state for care after her doctor discovered a severe fetal anomaly, and has repeatedly avoided press inquiries about abortion ever since. So as Cruz tries to distance himself from the very real consequences of the abortion bans that the US supreme court unleashed, it’s important to look at exactly how influential Cruz was behind the scenes in enabling this health care disaster. The conservative fifth circuit court of appeals, which Texas Monthly accurately described in a headline as the Rogue Court That Paved the Way for Roe’s Demise, is packed with rightwing judges who got their start in Texas politics. Arguably the most zealous anti-abortion idealog among them, Trump appointee James Ho, is an old friend of Cruz’s who was heavily involved in Cruz’s 2017 Senate campaign a decade after succeeding him as Texas solicitor general. Under the Trump administration, Cruz “basically had free rein” to fill district courts with conservative judges and reportedly urged Trump behind the scenes during that time to nominate Ho to the fifth circuit, according to the Texas Tribune. Cruz then attended his “good friend” Ho’s swearing in ceremony, and Ho went on to become the notorious appellate judge who cited a wildlife case in his argument to ban the commonly used abortion pill in 2023, writing that doctors suffer an “aesthetic injury” when they lose the ability to observe their unborn patients –much like a bird-watcher suffers if he can’t look at birds. Cruz has also bragged about his role in getting Texans Don Willett and Andrew Oldham confirmed to the fifth circuit, touting his own role in “reshap[ing] the federal judiciary” in a 2020 press release and gushing that Willett, Oldham and Ho were “well on their way to becoming national judicial superstars”. The trio have since been described as “arguably the most transformative figures” on the court that paved the way for overturning Roe, as they greenlit laws such as Texas’s infamously cruel abortion ban, the Heartbeat Act (Senate Bill 8), and overturned lower court rulings on abortion cases that were intentionally aimed for the US supreme court. Cruz hasn’t just been a cheerleader on the sidelines of the abortion wars; he was a key player in transforming the judiciary to pave the way for Dobbs and enable his own state to punish and essentially torture pregnant women the way they are doing now. He can avoid questions on the subject, but there’s really not much more he needs to say: the crisis in Texas already belongs to him. This could give Allred the boost he needs to make history in Texas.","2024-09-03T12:00:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/03/ted-cruz-texas-senate-election-abortion-record"
"abortion","The supreme court abortion ruling hides conservative justices’ partisan agenda","The supreme court is a messy institution. Its six conservative justices are mired in infighting over both the pace of their shared ideological project of remaking American law and life according to rightwing preferences, and over their preferred methodological course for doing so. Their squabbling is not helped by the fact that two of them, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, keep embarrassing the court with gauche public scandals, which draw attention to the court’s legitimacy crises like a vulgar flag waving above One First Street. For their part, the liberals are exhausted, impotent and at times apparently publicly despairing. Their dissents have sometimes taken on tones of exasperation and peeved sarcasm, as if they’re turning to the country and asking: “Can you believe this?” Their most senior member, Sonia Sotomayor, recently told an interviewer that over the past several terms, since the court’s conservative supermajority was sealed under the Trump administration, she has sometimes gone into her chambers after the announcement of major decisions and wept. She says she anticipates having to do so again: in one recent dissent, she warned ominously about the future of gay marriage rights. The court’s partisans like to point out that it controls neither the military nor the federal budget; the court’s legitimacy, they say, comes merely from the fact that people believe it to be legitimate. But increasingly, many of them don’t. The court’s approval rating remains at record lows, and the justices’ conduct over the past several years has punctured the mystique of scholarly seriousness that the institution once pretended to. They don’t seem like wise legal scholars, carefully and dispassionately deliberating the merits of competing interests and claims. Instead, they seem more like a bunch of bumbling partisan hacks – perhaps just more cynical and less clever than the average Republican operatives stuffed into suits throughout DC. The court did not appear particularly competent, for instance, when on Wednesday, a draft opinion in Moyle v United States was briefly uploaded to the court’s webpage. The case concerns Idaho, which has one of the most extreme and sadistic anti-choice legal regimes in the nation, and asks whether states’ attempts to ban abortions even in cases of medical emergencies can be pre-empted by Emtala, a federal law regulating emergency rooms. After it was uploaded, the opinion was quickly taken down; in a statement, a supreme court spokesperson said that the opinion had been uploaded briefly by mistake. By then, Bloomberg news had already obtained the full text of the draft, and it was published soon thereafter. This makes the third time in recent memory that an opinion in a high-profile supreme court case was leaked before its official release. The first was when Alito reportedly told a conservative movement activist friend of his upcoming decision in 2014’s Burwell v Hobby Lobby, a case that struck down the Affordable Care Act’s contraception coverage mandate for religious employers; the second was when the draft of Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs was leaked to Politico almost two full months before it was ultimately issued by the court. All three of these leaks have been in cases pertaining to women’s reproductive rights. But if the court is bumbling in their functioning, embarrassing in their public personas and obviously fractious in their internal relations, then the leaked order in Moyle also shows that the conservative majority can be quite calculating in their political strategy. In the draft decision, issued per curium (that is, unsigned), the court dismisses the case as improvidently granted, and sends it back down to the lower courts. They include the restoration of a lower court order that had allowed emergency abortions to continue in Idaho hospitals while the case proceeds. For now, that means that women experiencing failing pregnancies in Idaho will still be able to get the care they need to preserve their health, their fertility and their lives; hopefully, emergency room doctors there will feel safe enough to actually perform the procedures, and patients will no longer have to be airlifted out of the state to receive the routine care that will stabilize them. That’s what’s most important for the American public: that for the time being, lives will not be needlessly lost in service to the anti-choice agenda. But to the court’s conservative majority, what seems to be most important is pushing the abortion issue – and an inevitable ruling that eventually will allow states to ban emergency abortions – past the November election. The decision in Moyle was transparently a compromise between the court’s three liberals, who wanted to preserve women’s lives, and the three more pragmatic conservatives – John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who wanted to preserve Donald Trump’s electoral chances. These conservatives know that a ruling saying that states can allow women to bleed out, suffer septic infections, have seizures from eclampsia, lose the function of their uterus and ultimately die – out of deference to preserving what by then are already doomed, futile pregnancies – would hurt Republican candidates in this November’s elections. That doesn’t mean they don’t want to issue such a murderous ruling; it means that they want to do so at a more politically convenient moment. So three of the court’s conservatives are acting like Republican political strategists, working to conceal their own legal agenda in order to minimize harm to their preferred party in an election year. That would be bad enough. But not all of the court’s conservatives can exercise even this degree of cynical, self-interested restraint. Although the order was issued per curium, Alito dissented, arguing that the state ban on emergency abortions should be enforceable under federal law; he was joined by Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Some of his reasoning was echoed by Barrett, whose concurrence, studded with handwringing concerns as to whether Emtala sufficiently protected the conscience rights of anti-abortion doctors and whether it could pre-empt a state criminal law, read like a road map for anti-choice lawyers seeking to re-argue the issue at a later, more politically amenable time. (Another sign of the court’s dysfunction – how often opinions are now accompanied by a flurry of dissents and concurrences, with each of the justices seemingly very eager to publicly distinguish their own thinking from that of their colleagues.) Together, their writings made it clear that though the court’s conservatives are split – sometimes fiercely and peevishly so – over how fast to proceed, they agree over their ultimate goal: one day, probably sooner than we think, this case will come back, and the supreme court will allow states to ban emergency abortions. What follows will be blood on their hands.","2024-06-28T10:00:22Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/28/supreme-court-abortion-ruling-conservative-justices"
"abortion","Arizona to vote on enshrining abortion rights in state constitution in November","Arizona voters will decide this November whether to add abortion rights into their state constitution, a prospect that could turbocharge voter turnout in a critical battleground state in the 2024 election. Late Monday, the Arizona secretary of state’s office announced that it had validated an estimated 577,971 signatures in support of a ballot measure, the Arizona For Abortion Access Act, to establish a constitutional right to abortion in the state. On X, the office called the measure “the largest petition effort in Arizona history”. The measure will be listed on the ballot as Proposition 139. Arizona is not the only state to face the prospect of an abortion-related ballot measure this November. So far, states including Colorado, Florida and Nevada – another key battleground state – are also set to hold similar ballot measures. Tuesday also marks the deadline for the state of Missouri to determine whether to add its own abortion-related measure to its ballots. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, ballot measures that protect or preserve abortion rights have successfully passed even in red states such as Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky. However, they have never been tested during a presidential election. Democrats are hoping that enthusiasm for the measures will boost turnout among their base, especially since the vice-president, Kamala Harris, one of the Democrats’ most effective messengers on abortion rights, became the party’s nominee. Abortion is currently legal up until 15 weeks in Arizona. Earlier this year, the state supreme court ruled that a near-total abortion ban from 1864 – enacted before Arizona even became a state – could take effect. That ruling unleashed weeks of nationwide outrage and ultimately led a handful of Republicans to break with their party to vote in favor of a bill to repeal the 1864 ban. If passed, Arizona for Abortion Access Act would establish that Arizonans have “a fundamental right to abortion”. It would protect the right to abortion until fetal viability, which is typically dated to around 24 weeks of pregnancy, and allow for abortions past that point if a medical provider deems them necessary to protect a pregnant individual’s life, physical health or mental health. In May, a CBS poll found that 66% of Arizona adults want abortion to be legal in all or most cases.","2024-08-13T17:23:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/13/arizona-abortion-november-vote"
"abortion","Joe Biden ‘really fumbled’ a winning issue for Democrats – abortion","Joe Biden went into the Thursday presidential debate with one ace in the hole: abortion. And somehow, in a fumbling and frail performance, the president managed to blow even that. In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, a decision joined by three justices nominated by Donald Trump, support for abortion has climbed even in red states. Republican strongholds like Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio have voted in favor of maintaining or even strengthening abortion rights; purple Michigan, a state Biden desperately needs to win, has too. The Biden campaign knows that abortion is a winning issue – that’s why it has dispatched the vice-president, Kamala Harris, on a nationwide, months-long tour to talk about it. But instead of hammering Trump, whose administration paved the way for Roe’s demise and whose potential return to power could lead to federal abortion restrictions, Biden stumbled to give a single coherent answer about the procedure. “I supported Roe v Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation. And a third time is between the doctor – I mean, it’d be between the woman and the state,” Biden said, according to a CNN transcript of the debate. “The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women’s health is ridiculous. That’s the last – no politician should be making that decision.” He continued: “A doctor should be making those decisions. That’s how it should be run. That’s what you’re going to do.” When the US supreme court first decided Roe in 1973, legalizing abortion nationwide, the justices implemented a kind of sliding scale of abortion rights, on which a patient’s right to an abortion could vary depending on their trimester of pregnancy. This may have been the framework that Biden was referring to, although his articulation of it is not exactly accurate (or possible to follow). In any case, by the time the supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, federal law around abortion restrictions had changed. “Roe”, which is really more of the popular term for both the original Roe decision and the line of cases that followed, had come to essentially block states from totally banning abortion prior to fetal viability, a benchmark that generally occurs around 24 weeks of pregnancy. By making it sound as though the state and doctors – whom Biden kept referring to using male pronouns – should get to decide whether a woman can have an abortion, Biden abandoned his party’s vigorous and effective attempts to frame abortion as a matter of freedom and rights. “That was really fumbled,” said Tresa Undem, who has been polling people on abortion for more than two decades. Abortion is, she continued, “very easy to communicate on right now, because a majority of the public is pro-choice, majority of voters are pro-choice. It’s very easy. They don’t want politicians involved in this decision at all. That’s the bottom line.” US elections 2024: a guide to the first presidential debate Biden v Trump: 90 miserable minutes Who won the meme wars? Biden’s performance sends Democrats into panic Six who could replace Biden Trump and Biden’s claims – factchecked Part of Biden’s issue may be that the devout Catholic – who once said he was personally not “big on abortion” – does not have a track record of promoting abortion rights. While he was on the campaign trail in 2020, his reluctance to even say the word “abortion” frustrated abortion rights activists. Trump, in contrast, stayed disciplined on abortion during the Thursday debate. He repeatedly called it a states’ rights issue and demurred on whether it should be legal in cases of rape, incest or medical emergencies. He glided past the fact that many states with near-total abortion bans do not permit the procedure in cases of rape or incest, and that a supreme court stacked with his justices had just punted on the legal question of whether states can ban abortions in some emergencies. The former president also avoided mentioning that some anti-abortion activists believe he could use a 151-year-old law to enact a total abortion ban nationwide. During another exchange, Trump spoke forcefully about how restoring Roe would mean that Biden “can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth”, as well as “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby”. It was language that Trump had deployed during a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, to the delight of the anti-abortion movement. These claims are based on myths. Infanticide is obviously illegal. The vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester of pregnancy; those that happen after that point are often due to a medical issue. The abortion rights movement has worked for years to destigmatize these procedures and eradicate the phrase “late-term abortion”, which is not a phrase doctors use. But Biden couldn’t seem to figure out if he wanted to correct Trump’s falsehoods or confirm them. “That is simply not true. That Roe v Wade does not provide for that. That’s not the circumstance. Only when the woman’s life is in danger, if she’s going to die – that’s the only circumstance in which that can happen,” he said. “But we are not for late-term abortion, period – period, period.” There’s little danger that staunchly pro-choice voters will leave Biden, according to Undem, since Democrats are so associated with abortion rights while Republicans are so linked to restrictions. But Biden’s inability to talk about what should be a slam-dunk issue for Democrats may bolster concerns that he’s just not up for a second presidency. “It was pretty dismal,” Undem said. “It just seemed incoherent, not clear. At one point, he got the message in that politicians shouldn’t be making this decision at all. But it was not great.”","2024-06-28T16:18:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/28/biden-debate-abortion"
"abortion","Queen Esther by John Irving review – a disappointing companion to The Cider House Rules","If some writers have an imperial phase, where they hit the heights time after time, then American novelist John Irving’s ran through a series of four fat, satisfying novels, from his 1978 breakthrough The World According to Garp to 1989’s A Prayer for Owen Meany. Those were generous, funny, big-hearted books, tying characters he calls “outliers” to social issues from feminism to abortion. Since Owen Meany, it’s been diminishing returns, except in page length. His last novel, 2022’s The Last Chairlift, was 900 pages of subjects Irving had explored better in earlier books (mutism, dwarfism, transgenderism), with a 200-page screenplay in the middle to pad it out – as if padding were needed. So we approach a new Irving with caution but still a small flame of hope, which burns hotter when we learn that Queen Esther – a mere 432 pages – “returns to the world of The Cider House Rules”. That 1985 novel is one of Irving’s very best, set largely in an orphanage in St Cloud’s, Maine, run by Dr Wilbur Larch and his protege Homer Wells. In The Cider House Rules, Irving wrote about abortion and belonging with colour, comedy and an all-encompassing empathy. And it was a significant work because it left behind the topics that were becoming tiresome tics in his books: wrestling, bears, Vienna, prostitution. Queen Esther opens in the town of Penacook, New Hampshire in the early 20th century, where Thomas and Constance Winslow adopt 14-year-old orphan Esther from St Cloud’s. We are a few decades before the action of The Cider House Rules, yet Wilbur Larch remains recognisable: already addicted to ether, adored by his nurses, starting every speech with “Here in St Cloud’s …” But his appearance in Queen Esther is limited to these early scenes. The Winslows worry about raising Esther well: she’s Jewish, and “how could they help a young Jewish girl find herself?” To answer that, we flash forward to Esther’s adulthood in the 1920s. She will be part of the Jewish emigration to Palestine, where she will become part of Haganah, the Zionist paramilitary organisation whose “purpose was to protect Jewish settlements from Arab attacks” and which would later form the core of the Israeli Defense Forces. These are huge subjects to tackle, but having introduced them, Irving dodges out. Because if it’s disappointing that Queen Esther is not really about St Cloud’s and Dr Larch, it’s even more disappointing that it’s also not about Esther. For reasons that must relate to plot engineering, Esther becomes a surrogate mother for another of the Winslows’ daughters, and gives birth to a baby boy, Jimmy, in 1941 – and the bulk of this novel is Jimmy’s story. And here is where Irving’s obsessions come roaring back, both regular and specific. Jimmy moves to – where else? – Vienna; there’s discussion of dodging the Vietnam draft through self-mutilation (A Prayer for Owen Meany); a dog with a symbolic name (Hard Rain, meet Sorrow from The Hotel New Hampshire); as well as wrestling, prostitutes, writers and penises (Irvings passim). Jimmy is a less interesting character than Esther promised to be, and the secondary players, such as students Claude and Jolanda, and Jimmy’s tutor Annelies Eissler, are flat too. There are some nice set pieces – Jimmy losing his virginity; a fight where a couple of thugs get battered with a crutch and a bicycle pump – but they’re here and gone. Irving has never been a subtle writer, but that is not the problem. He has always reiterated his points, foreshadowed plot developments and allowed them to accumulate in the reader’s mind before bringing them to fruition in long, shocking, amusing scenes. For example, in Irving’s novels, body parts tend to go missing: think of the tongue in Garp, the finger in Owen Meany. Those absences echo through the story. In Queen Esther, a major character loses an arm – but we only find out 30 pages before the end. Esther returns late in the novel, but only with a last-minute sense of wrapping things up. We never do find out the full story of her life in Palestine and Israel. Queen Esther is a disappointment from a writer who once gave such joy. That’s the bad news. The good news is that The Cider House Rules – I reread it alongside this novel – still stands up beautifully, 40 years on. So read that instead: it’s twice as long as Queen Esther, but 12 times as good. • Queen Esther by John Irving is published by Scribner (£22).

"abortion","Wisconsin supreme court race a litmus test for Elon Musk’s political power","A race to determine control of the Wisconsin supreme court that has profound stakes for voting, abortion and labor rights in the state, is also shaping up to be a litmus test of Elon Musk’s political power, making it one of the most consequential elections of Donald Trump’s second term. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority on the state supreme court, but the liberal justice Ann Walsh Bradley is retiring. Susan Crawford, a liberal judge, is facing off on Tuesday against the conservative judge Brad Schimel for the seat. The winner will determine which party has control of a court that is set to rule on the future of the state’s 1849 abortion ban, collective bargaining rights and the makeup of the state’s eight congressional districts. The election has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $80m spent on both sides so far. Musk began spending in the race earlier this year, shortly after Tesla filed a lawsuit challenging a Wisconsin law that blocks the company from opening car dealerships in the state. The billionaire’s Super Pac is offering $100 to those who sign a petition in opposition to “activist judges”. So far, Musk and groups he funds have spent more than $20m in the race. On Friday, he posted on Twitter/X and said he would campaign in Wisconsin this weekend and give away $1m as part of a sweepstakes-like contest to people who had voted. He later deleted the post after experts pointed out such a program could be illegal under state law. He posted a revised tweet saying he would distribute the money to people to act as spokespeople for the petition. The Wisconsin attorney general, Josh Kaul, a Democrat, also sued Musk and his Pac on Friday to stop the giveaway, though an appeals court reportedly declined to immediately step in and stop it. “This is kind of a test case for Elon Musk,” Crawford, a former prosecutor, said in an interview. “He wants to make sure that nothing stands in the way of what he’s doing to try to dismantle the federal government.” Schimel’s campaign did not respond to an interview request. Musk’s entrance in the race comes as he has railed against federal judges who have threatened to halt Trump’s agenda, calling for the impeachment of some and backing Republicans who have heeded the call. So much money being spent in a state supreme court election would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. Wisconsin supreme court justices are elected to 10 year terms, and until recently the candidates had low profiles and few paid attention to the races. In a 2020 state supreme court race, both candidates spent a combined $10m. But in recent years, awareness has grown of the powerful role state supreme courts can play in defining major issues, bringing more money and hard-nosed politics to these races. In North Carolina, a Republican candidate is seeking to overturn a supreme court election he lost to a Democratic candidate by 734 votes. “What we’ve really seen in recent years is just how important state courts are in determining election law and how elections are run,” said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney at the state democracy research initiative at the University of Wisconsin law school. She noted that Trump carried the state by just 30,000 votes in 2024 and Biden by even less in 2020. “Really what we’re seeing is state courts are playing a huge role not just in determining issues for the state, but in determining rules for elections that can have impacts at a national level when you’re looking at a swing state like Wisconsin,” she added. Schimel, a former Republican state attorney general, has made no secret that there would be little daylight between him and Trump, praising the president and talking about the need for a “support network” for him. He has also posed with a large inflatable Trump and said the justices “screwed [Trump] over” by keeping a Green party candidate off the ballot in 2020 (Trump narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden that year). He has also called one of the female justices on the state supreme court “dumb as a sack of hammers” and another female justice “crazy”. Trump endorsed Schimel on 21 March. State Democrats have made the race a referendum on Musk, putting up “people v Musk” billboards across the state and holding town halls. When the party tested messaging, it showed ads highlighting Musk’s connections to Schimel to “motivate Democrats who otherwise want to tune out politics entirely to come out, cast a ballot, and recruit their friends”, said Ben Wikler, chairman of the state Democratic party. “If Brad Schimel loses this race and Susan Crawford wins, it’ll become clear to Democrats that they can fight back against Musk and win,” said Wikler. “And it’ll be clear to Republicans that Musk may not be able to save their bacon if they keep going along with his attacks on our country. That could have a profound impact on the whole arc of American politics in this era.” The race has energized Democrats. “Back in November and December, I think a lot of people I was talking to were pretty discouraged by some of the results that they saw in the November election after having put a lot of time and energy into some of those campaigns,” Crawford said. “That has dramatically changed in the last couple of months as the administration has taken a lot of actions in a hurry that have made people really worried and concerned about the direction our country is heading.” In the weeks after Musk got involved in race, Wikler said, he saw Democrats “get up off the mat and lean into the fightback”. • • • Even before Musk’s involvement, the high stakes of the race were clear. The court heard oral arguments in a case challenging the state’s 1849 abortion ban last year and is set to consider another one dealing with whether the state constitution protects the right to an abortion. In 2020, the state supreme court narrowly voted 4-3 to turn away a Trump lawsuit challenging his loss in the state and seeking to overturn the results. In 2023, Democrats won a major victory when the liberal candidate Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the court and flipped its ideological balance. Last year, the new state supreme court struck down state legislative maps, getting rid of Republican districts that were so distorted they gave Democrats no chance of ever winning a majority. Republicans went from having a near two-thirds supermajority to a slim majority in the statehouse. The next court could hear a challenge to Wisconsin’s congressional maps, in which Republicans hold six of eight seats. That balance is also considered severely askew in favor of Republicans and could ultimately help determine control of the US House, where Republicans hold a majority of just a few seats. The spending in the race has shattered the more than $50m spent in the 2023 race. Musk has spent more than $18m through America Pac and Building America’s future. The Republican mega-donor Richard Uihlein has gotten somewhat less attention, but Uihlein-aligned groups have spent at least $5.3m in favor of Schimel, funneling it through various entities, according to campaign finance records. Lynde Uihlein, a cousin of Richard Uihlein has also been a major donor to the group A Better Wisconsin Together, which has spent more than $6m in the race supporting Crawford. The family members were also on separate sides of the 2023 state supreme court race. Robert Yablon, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted that the huge spending in the race was only possible because of the state’s loose campaign finance laws. People in Wisconsin can donate unlimited amounts to state parties, which can pass that money on to candidates. There are also very weak anti-coordination laws between independent expenditure groups and campaigns. The race, Yablon said, was a “test for judicial independence”. If Musk succeeds in winning and ultimately gets rulings favorable to him, it could undermine that perception. “You would hope that in a judicial race, you might have different candidates – maybe they have different ideologies or philosophies, different ways that they talk about the law, but it’s shared ground that they believe that the judiciary ought to operate independently from other branches, ought to check those branches,” he said. The turnout in Tuesday’s election is expected to be much lower than the turnout in the November presidential election, making it difficult to make firm conclusions about the voter reaction to Trump so far. But there still may be signals to take away from Tuesday’s contest. “If there is a strong win for Crawford, it will at least be evidence of the energy of liberals and the extent to which opposition to the Trump administration, to Elon Musk, has been effectively activated,” Yablon said. If Schimel wins, he said it “will probably be quite disheartening for liberals, for the Democratic party that’s invested so much in this race, and they may then really have to go back to the drawing board”.","2025-03-29T13:00:51Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/wisconsin-supreme-court-race-elon-musk"
"abortion","A congressman’s ex got a protective order against him. His boss has little to say about it","The party of family values strikes again Meet Cory Mills, a Republican congressman representing Florida. He is rabidly anti-abortion, incredibly anti-immigration, and obsequiously pro-Trump. Earlier this year, perhaps in a desperate bid to get Dear Leader to notice him, he introduced a bill, dubbed the “DON-ument Act”, which would make the wall on the US-Mexico border a national monument. In the great tradition of Republican congressmen from Florida (hello, Matt Gaetz!), it turns out Mills may also be a misogynistic creep. On Tuesday, a Florida judge granted a protective order against Mills at the request of his former girlfriend, Lindsey Langston, the reigning Miss United States. Langston, who is 19 years younger than 45-year-old Mills, told authorities she started a romantic relationship with the lawmaker in 2021, when Mills was still married but reportedly separated from his wife. According to Langston, after the breakup, Mills threatened to release nude images of her and harm any future boyfriends. The congressman has called the allegations “false” and hasn’t been charged with a crime, but, according to the New York Times, the judge said he did not find Mills’ “testimony concerning the intimate videos to be truthful” and granted an order restricting Mills from going within 500 feet of his ex’s residence or referring to her on social media. The court found that Langston “has reasonable cause to believe she is in imminent danger of becoming the victim of another act of dating violence”. Langston reportedly ended their relationship in February. That month also saw news reports that Mills was being investigated for an alleged assault on a 27-year-old woman called Sarah Raviani. This wasn’t his wife, if you’re trying to keep track. Rather, according to WRC-TV in Washington, who obtained an earlier version of the police report, Raviani was his “significant other for over a year”. When the authorities turned up she had bruises on her arm and that same police report, according to USA Today, “states Mills instructed the victim to lie about how she obtained bruises on her arms”. Raviani told the Daytona Beach News-Journal her bruising was caused by a medical condition and Mills, who has denied wrongdoing, was not arrested or charged with anything. Mills doesn’t just seem to have issues with these romantic partners; he seems to have quite a few problems meeting his financial obligations. Earlier this year the Republican was accused of failing to pay $85,000 in rent. His landlord tried to evict him after he failed to pay his monthly $20,833 rent between March and July. Most congressmen get paid $174,000 a year so I can understand why he struggled to pay an annual rent that was far higher than his salary. Mills, for his part, blamed an online payment problem for the issue and said he ended up paying his back rent later. The claims against him were dismissed. Poor old Mills always seems to get blamed for problems that are absolutely not his fault. He is also facing an investigation by the House ethics committee over allegations he held contracts with the US government while in Congress, in relation to a weapons company he founded a decade ago. So far, this investigation doesn’t seem to have had much impact on his career. We hear all the time about how the GOP is the party of law and order and family values. What, you might be wondering, do Mills’s colleagues have to say about all his run-ins with the law? Not much! “You have to ask Representative Mills about that,” said Mike Johnson, the House speaker, when asked about the allegations against Mills this week. “He’s been a faithful colleague here. I know his work on the Hill. I don’t know all the details … Let’s talk about things that are really serious.” Yes, let’s talk about things that are really serious, shall we? Because clearly being investigated for allegedly assaulting one girlfriend and then allegedly threatening to release sexual videos of another girlfriend aren’t serious at all. Certainly nothing that might disqualify someone from being a politician in a country that is led by an adjudicated sexual predator. From Matt Gaetz to Mills to Pete Hegseth to Roy Moore, the list of people in Trump’s orbit accused of sexual misconduct seems to grow by the day. And yet, funnily enough, a common theme among Republican men accused of sexual misconduct is that it’s trans people who are the real threat to women. “We must stop the lefts attack on women,” Mills wrote on X in 2022. “We must stand to protect women from biological males competing unfairly,” Mills wrote in another X post. If Mills is what Republicans “protecting” women looks like, I think I’ll pass. Costa Rica’s president limits abortion to life-threatening cases Fulfilling a promise he had previous given religious conservatives, President Rodrigo Chaves has limited abortion access to situations when the mother’s life is in danger. Before running for president in 2022, Chaves worked at the World Bank, where he was accused of sexually harassing various women and was eventually sanctioned for misconduct. He has denied the allegations. Seems like he would fit in well with the Republican party. Virginia Giuffre on her abuse at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell “So many young women, myself included, have been criticised for returning to Epstein’s lair even after we knew what he wanted from us,” Giuffre writes in her posthumous memoir, an extract of which is published in the Guardian. “But that stance discounts what many of us had been through before we encountered Epstein, as well as how good he was at spotting girls whose wounds made them vulnerable. Several of us had been molested or raped as children; many of us were poor or even homeless. We were girls who no one cared about, and Epstein pretended to care … And then, he did his worst to them.” TikTok watches are desperate for a Crock-pot cauldron There’s been a lot of toil and trouble brewing on WitchTok recently, after Crock-Pot apparently reneged on its promise to make a slow cooker in the shape of a cauldron. Not very sensible to get on the bad side of internet witches; they have quite the track record. Kim Kardashian is now selling a thong with a built-in pubic wig It’s called “the ultimate bush”, costs $32, and comes in 12 different colours. You can tell the Kardashians are fading from relevance because Kim keeps pulling these desperate and somewhat Goop-y stunts. Oscar Wilde’s library card reissued 130 years after being revoked over gay conviction I’d love to hear what the ghost of Wilde has to say about this. You know it would be pithy. Queer and trans immigrants allege forced labor and sexual assault in Ice facility In multiple legal complaints, immigrants detained at a South Louisiana Ice Processing Center have said they were made to perform hard manual labor for as little as $1 per day. They also allege queer people were targeted by an assistant warden who harassed and sexually assaulted them. The week in pawtriarchy Chicago’s Roscoe Village is home to a funny-looking shape in the sidewalk that looks like a rat fell at high speed from outer space into wet concrete. The ro-dent, known as the Chicago Rat Hole or “Splatatouille”, has become something of a viral sensation and tourist attractions. Turns out, however, that no rats were harmed in the making of the hole. Rather, after conducting a serious scientific inquiry, a team of researchers now believes there’s a 98.67% chance the hole was actually made by a squirrel. It’s a sad tale, but at least that poor squirrel made its mark on the world.

"abortion","Democratic states train non-doctors on providing abortions to expand US access","Democratic states across the country are embarking on a pioneering effort to increase access to abortion by teaching people who are not doctors to offer and perform the procedure. In Washington state, a first-of-its-kind pilot program called the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project announced this week that it trained 10 pharmacists to prescribe abortion pills; so far, they have prescribed abortions to 43 people. With Roe v Wade gone and abortion now all but eliminated in a dozen or so states, the project is the latest attempt to expand access to the procedure in the parts of the country that still allow it. Connecticut and Delaware have in recent years passed legislation to permit physician assistants, midwives and some nurses to perform abortions, while Oregon, Maryland and Illinois are now devoting millions of state dollars to programs that train similar professions in the procedure. “Even in Washington state, where abortion is legal, people are facing barriers to accessing abortion care – especially people who are struggling to make ends meet, who live in rural areas or don’t have easy access to reproductive health care,” said Beth Rivin, the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project’s managing director and president of Uplift International, which partnered with the online pharmacy Honeybee Health to dispense the abortion pills. “This expands abortion access by bringing a new profession into abortion provision.” Of the states that still allow abortions, 14 say that only physicians may perform the procedure, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions. But in the years since the US supreme court overturned Roe in the 2022 decision Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, physicians – already in short supply in the US – have struggled to get training in how to provide abortions. Abortion rights supporters have long said that non-physicians should be permitted to provide abortions earlier on in pregnancy if they involve pills or simpler procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the preeminent membership organization for OB-GYNs in the US, supports allowing certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform abortions, since studies have found no “significant difference” in the complication rates of medication abortions performed by doctors compared to other trained clinicians. “Let’s free up providers who can do the complex cases to do complex cases,” said Kylea Laina Liese, associate professor at the Department of Human Development Nursing Science at the University of Illinois. In 2024, the University of Illinois College of Nursing became one of three organizations to receive $2m from the state’s public health department to expand abortion training – money that Liese is now using to train the first cohort of physicians and non-physicians. Midwives, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, Liese said, “are much more likely to represent the communities that they work in. That’s something that’s really missing in abortion care. Being able to have Bipoc communities get their reproductive and sexual health services from providers that look like them and that they trust – it lowers those burdens.” More than 60% of all practicing US physicians identify as white, while far smaller fractions identify as Black, Indigenous or people of color. In addition to increasing access, advocates say, these programs can help destigmatize abortion by moving it out of the silo of specialized abortion providers and clinics. In Maryland, where the state health department has awarded more than $10m to the University of Maryland to train new abortion providers, the program is also looking to teach emergency room doctors and pediatricians – the kind of specialties that don’t typically offer abortion training. “My dream for all primary care is: you see someone has a positive pregnancy test, you tell them they have a positive pregnancy test, and then you’re able to offer them any option that they choose,” said Jessica Lee, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who is helping run the program. *** Don Downing, co-director of the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project and a professor emeritus of pharmacy at the University of Washington, was surprised by how many patients and pharmacists were interested in the project. “I really thought, about two or three years ago, that we might have difficulty finding pharmacists who are willing to prescribe a medication abortion,” Downing said. “Well, it turns out the pharmacists were as upset as I was with the Dobbs decision, and we got our 10 pharmacists – we wanted to keep it small – in very quick order.” Pharmacists’ ability to prescribe medication varies from state to state. In Washington state, the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project takes advantage of decades-old law, which authorizes pharmacists to prescribe drugs. Recent changes in the Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the common abortion pill mifepristone also expanded the types of providers who can prescribe and dispense the drug to include certified non-physicians. But those changes could prove to be short lived. Shortly after Roe fell, anti-abortion activists filed a lawsuit asking a court to roll back the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone. That case ultimately reached the US supreme court last year, which unanimously ruled to preserve access to mifepristone – but did so on technical grounds, leaving the door open for further attacks on the drug. That lawsuit is now continuing in a lower court. Abortion pills now account for roughly two-thirds of all US abortions. There is also the prospect of narrower rollbacks. The incoming Trump administration could reverse more recent changes to mifepristone’s regulation – including changes that have enabled pharmacists to prescribe the drug. “It’s pretty frightening,” Downing said. “It’d be like saying pharmacists can’t provide flu shots anymore or Covid shots.” If those rollbacks happen, Liese and Lee said that their states’ respective programs would focus on teaching providers how to offer surgical abortions as well as medication abortions that only use the drug misoprostol (which is safe but can lead to more complications). Whatever happens, Rivin hopes that other blue states will try to replicate the Pharmacist Abortion Access Project. In New York – which already permits some non-doctors, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, to perform abortions – lawmakers introduced a bill that would effectively allow pharmacists to administer abortion pills. That bill stalled, but a similar measure has already been introduced this year. Legislators have also introduced a bill to create a state training program for abortion providers. “Our model is definitely a model that those states might be interested in. It’s more important than ever in 2025 and for the next few years,” Rivin said. “So we’re encouraging leaders in those states to get in touch with us.”","2025-01-13T12:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/13/abortion-access-healthcare-workers-democratic-states"
"abortion","Texas Republicans open to death penalty for abortion providers","Texas Republicans are open to applying the death penalty to abortion providers, a new proposal from the state party indicates. Over the weekend, during the Texas GOP convention, Republican delegates voted on a party platform for 2024 that proclaims “abortion is not healthcare, it is homicide” and suggests striking a state law that protects abortion providers from being charged with homicide. In Texas, capital murder is punishable by the death penalty. Killing a child under the age of 15 can qualify as capital murder, the most severe form of homicide. Elsewhere in the platform, the Texas GOP calls for “legislation to abolish abortion by immediately securing the right to life and equal protection of the laws to all preborn children from the moment of fertilization”. That language, as highlighted by the feminist writer Jessica Valenti, who first called attention to it earlier this week, draws from the rhetoric of “abortion abolitionists”, a fringe, hardline segment of the anti-abortion movement that has inched closer to the mainstream in recent years. While the mainstream anti-abortion movement typically supports exempting women seeking abortions from punishment, abortion abolitionists adhere to what they consider a more consistent line of logic: if a fetus is a person and abortion is murder, then abortion patients deserve to be punished like murderers. Abortion patients are not mentioned in the provision in the proposed platform that redefines abortion as homicide, making its implications for abortion seekers unclear. Abortion bans typically target abortion providers for punishment, not patients. Punishing women for abortions is a politically toxic stance, particularly as support for abortion rights has surged in the wake of the overturning of Roe v Wade. Even before Roe fell, Texas lawmakers repeatedly introduced bills that would have instituted the death penalty for abortion patients. They all stalled out in the Republican-dominated state legislature. Regardless of the platform’s implications for abortion patients, adding language that in effect defines fetuses as people, complete with full legal rights and protections, could have vast implications for wide swaths of Texas law, including cutting off access to in vitro fertilization. Efforts to establish “fetal personhood” have sped up in anti-abortion circles in recent years, but experts say that the full implications of this ideology have never been realized. Earlier this year, IVF treatments in Alabama temporarily ground to a halt after the state supreme court ruled frozen embryos were “intrauterine children”. As the home to one in 10 American women of reproductive age, Texas has long been a key laboratory for activists and lawmakers looking to fine-tune bills that restrict reproductive rights – many of which are exported to other state legislatures across the country. In the 50-page platform, the Texas GOP also calls homosexuality an “abnormal lifestyle choice” and says providing gender-affirming care to minors is “child abuse”. The platform demands that the recent renaming of military bases be reversed in order to “publicly honor the southern heroes”, and confirms the platform supports “affirmation of God, including prayer, the Bible, and the Ten Commandments being returned to our schools, courthouses, and other government buildings”. Although Republicans voted over the weekend on the proposed platform, the votes were set to be tallied this week. The Texas GOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the platform has been formally adopted or on its approach to abortion. The party platform is not a legislative slate; these proposals may never make their way into bills, much less pass. The Texas state legislature, which meets only in odd-numbered years, will open for business in January 2025.","2024-05-30T19:53:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/texas-republicans-vote-death-penalty-abortion-providers"
"abortion","Reliance on fertility apps on rise in England and Wales, study shows","Women in England and Wales are increasingly ditching the pill in favour of fertility-tracking apps, raising the risk of a rise in unplanned pregnancies, a study suggests. Researchers concluded there had been a shift in attitudes towards contraception in the last five years, from “more reliable” hormonal options, such as the pill and the implant, to “fertility awareness-based methods”. While further research was needed to understand the reasons behind the change, the trend away from hormonal contraception corresponded to a rise in abortion rates, with wider implications for healthcare services, researchers concluded. More women are using smartphone apps to track menstrual cycles or symptoms of ovulation. The aim of the apps is to help to estimate a woman’s fertile window, with women avoiding sex on those days to prevent pregnancy. The researchers said “fertility awareness-based methods”, which are often promoted on social media, could be less reliable, with the potential to “increase unintended pregnancies”. The typical failure rate for these methods ranges from two to 23 in every 100 women in the first year of use, compared with seven in 100 women for the pill or implants and fewer than one in 100 for the coil, they added. “While the rise in abortion rates is multifactorial, one aspect that needs scrutiny is any change in contraceptive use, and particularly this surge in the use of e-health, including fertility apps, period-tracker apps, and natural family-planning apps,” experts at the University of Edinburgh said. In the new study, published in the journal BMJ Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health, researchers examined data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) to explore which methods of contraception women who requested abortions in England and Wales were using at the time they fell pregnant. Two periods of time were compared: January to June 2018, which included 33,495 women, and January to June 2023, which included 55,055 women. Reported use of fertility awareness-based methods at the time of conception increased from 0.4% in 2018 to 2.5% in 2023. The average age of women using these methods fell from almost 30 to 27, analysis showed. Women taking hormonal contraceptives such as the pill, the mini pill, patches and vaginal rings declined from 18.8% in 2018 to 11.3% in 2023. Use of the contraceptive implant – a small rod placed under the skin which releases a hormone to stop the ovaries releasing an egg each month – fell from 3% to 0.6% over the period. Those who reported using no form of contraception when they became pregnant increased from 56% in 2018 to 70% in 2023. This was an observational study, so conclusions cannot be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers also acknowledged that abortion patients may not reflect the sexually active population in general. They also said precise fertility awareness methods used were not recorded, so the rise in the use of smartphone app technologies in particular could only be assumed. However, they concluded that the findings showed a “shift in contraception use from more reliable hormonal methods of contraception to less reliable fertility awareness-based methods of contraception among abortion patients”. They added: “There appears to have been a significant increase in the proportion of individuals attending Bpas for abortion who use fertility awareness-based methods as a form of contraception and are using no method of contraception. “This may be a result of preference or it may be related to difficulties with access to more effective methods of contraception in the preconception and post-abortion periods.” The study also found that the proportion of women who were seven weeks pregnant or under when they requested an abortion from Bpas services rose to 59.4% in 2023 compared with 35.6% in 2018. Dr Patricia Lohr, director of research and innovation at Bpas, said: “This study of abortion patients showed a rise in the use of fertility awareness-based methods and a decline in hormonal contraception. This may indicate women are making different contraceptive choices or can’t get the methods they want.” A separate Bpas survey of the general population found nearly half of women (49%) face barriers to accessing contraception, Lohr said. “In this context, abortion remains a vital option, whether as a back-up when contraception fails or as an alternative when contraception is unavailable or unsuitable.” She added: “At the same time, it’s vital to push for modern, innovative contraceptive methods that fit seamlessly into women’s lives and address concerns about side effects. “Women deserve a full range of options that meet their needs without compromise.”","2025-01-13T23:30:41Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/13/reliance-on-fertility-apps-on-rise-in-england-and-wales-study-shows"
"abortion","‘I’ve seen women suffer’: Malawi’s religious leaders fight for legal abortions","Throughout his ministry, the Rev Cliff Nyekanyeka has led funeral services for women who died after an illegal abortion in Malawi. He has visited hospitals where doctors have shown him the aftereffects of such procedures, including pictures of what he describes as “rotting uteruses”. And he has seen women struggling with unwanted pregnancies. It is this lived experience that has led Nyekanyeka to advocate for a woman’s right to choose, and to campaign for change in a country with one of the world’s strictest abortion laws. In Malawi, women seeking an abortion can be imprisoned for up to seven years and anyone administering an abortion to a woman could face 14 years in prison; it is permitted only to save a woman’s life. The law was introduced by the British under colonial rule. “I’ve seen women struggling; I’ve seen them suffering and I feel for them,” he says. “I am pro-choice because I’ve seen what it means [not to be], and I think I have to contribute to the movement.” Nyekanyeka, 45, coordinates the Religious Leaders Network for Choice, a group formed in 2019 with about 15 members and which now numbers more than 1,000 Christians and Muslims. They first came together after attending training sessions run by the Coalition for Prevention of Unsafe Abortion, which educates the public on unsafe abortion and builds grassroots momentum for law reform. The network conducts research into the intersection of religion and sexual and reproductive health and rights; and advocates for access to safe abortion to policymakers, lawyers, judges, the media and MPs. Despite the law, tens of thousands of women have abortions each year in Malawi. Research by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health, and the University of Malawi College of Medicine, published in 2017 – the latest date for which figures are available – estimated that 141,000 women in Malawi had an abortion in 2015, and that 60% of these resulted in complications that required treatment. Unsafe abortion is among the top five direct causes of maternal mortality in the country, contributing up to 18% of maternal deaths. The reality of women dying from unsafe abortions has pushed the network and civil society organisations to advocate for legislative reform. A bill to liberalise Malawi’s abortion laws was proposed in 2016 but never made it to parliament because of strong opposition. The termination of pregnancy bill would allow abortions when a woman’s mental or physical health was in danger, as well as in cases of rape, incest or serious foetal abnormalities. In 2021, the bill made it a step further when it was proposed in parliament by the MP Matthews Ngwale. After strong opposition, it was never discussed and was later withdrawn. At the time, Henry Saindi, secretary general of the Episcopal Conference, said: “It is only God who can give or take life irrespective of whatever circumstance that has happened. Human life remains sacred and it must be preserved, promoted and defended. The bill does not reflect our values, our culture and our aspirations as a nation.” That the bill made it to parliament was “a very big milestone” and down to the influence of some religious leaders advocating for wider access to abortion, says Simeon Thodi, advocacy manager at MSI Malawi, a non-profit provider of sexual and reproductive health services. “Religious leaders’ engagement with members of parliament is what led to the bill appearing in parliament for the first time,” he says. “That is how effective they are.” Religious leaders wield huge influence in Malawi where, according to the most recent census in 2018, 77% of the population identifies as Christian and almost 14% is Muslim. Nyatuwe Emma Phiri, of Malawi’s Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, has seen this in action. When she goes to communities to advocate for sexual health and reproductive rights, people are less inclined to listen to her. She says: “It’s like, ‘Oh no, these are the gender guides, the ones who want us to talk about men sleeping with other men. We don’t want to hear about it.’ So it’s a shutdown, an immediate shutdown.” But if a religious leader turns up to speak, says Phiri, people tend to listen. “They know that this person has some sort of authority to what they are saying and it is not coming from a lack of knowledge,” she says. “They have studied these things extensively, they have the data, and they’ve experienced it.” Women often confide in, and seek advice from, religious leaders, she adds. Despite recent inroads made in shifting opinion among Malawians, strong opposition to abortion persists. Nyekanyeka says some anti-abortion organisations spreading misinformation are heavily funded by US and UK groups. “They say, ‘this is not your phenomenon in Africa.

But the impact of the network is undeniable. “We have seen young people go to their MP and ask them to discuss abortion,” says Nyekanyeka. “We have seen a number of organisations issue press statements. We have seen people who are aware of what we are talking about. “We have a mass movement that can explain the bill, check misinformation, bring out facts and contribute to the advocacy [for access to abortion].”","2025-01-09T11:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/09/women-malawi-religious-leaders-legal-abortion-ban-maternal-mortality-christian-muslim"
"abortion","Don’t believe it – the Republicans aren’t ‘softening’ their stance on abortion","The press has pointed to the near erasure of the word abortion from the new Republican platform as evidence that the mind and soul of the Republican party now reside in the body of Donald J Trump. The document omits the right’s top-priority goal of a federal abortion ban and replaces it with Trump’s preference to let the states do the dirty work. Missing too is the holy grail of the antiabortion movement: a “human life amendment,” which would extend to fetuses and embryos the constitutional protections that were seized from pregnant people when the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022. The consensus is that the changes from the 2016 platform, which was used in the 2020 elections, to the 2024 version subordinate the Republican party’s long-held principles and strategies – not just on abortion but also on trade, entitlement cuts and same-sex marriage – to the transient political needs and desires of its leader. On abortion, news outlets from CNN to Fox to Roll Call have called the shift a “softening” of the party’s stance. Don’t be fooled. Apart from the fact that voters don’t read platforms and elected officials rarely abide by them, the “new” abortion position will make no practical or political difference. First – if this doesn’t go entirely without saying – Trump’s word is as good as the paper he flushes down his golden toilet. If a Republican Congress handed a President Trump a federal ban, does anyone think he’d veto it? Trump doesn’t really care about abortion anyhow. His stated opinions have swung every which way, from “I’m very pro-choice” in 1999 to “God made the decision” to overturn Roe in 2022, not a US supreme court packed with the far-right justices he appointed. Second, the court is already taking care of things. Yes, it rejected a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone – but did so only on the grounds that the plaintiffs, an ad hoc group of antiabortion medical professionals, did not have standing to sue. Public health and legal experts say that the ruling almost guarantees another challenge, this time with more carefully vetted plaintiffs. And state laws banning mifepristone are untouched. The supreme court also left in place two FDA regulations loosening the prescription and use of mifepristone, but only while the regulations are under appeal. And if the appeal reaches the high court? This session, the majority declared itself the boss of the federal agencies. Should the anti-abortion activists challenge the FDA’s authority again, there’s a good chance they will prevail. So far, neither judges no state lawmakers have succeeded in shutting down abortion access. In fact, the number of pregnancy terminations increased in 2023, after Roe’s undoing, thanks to telemedical providers prescribing and a global feminist underground sending pills into abortion deserts. Laws still protect these activities. Statutes in liberal states shield providers from prosecution by authorities in conservative states, and the fourth amendment protects first-class letters and packages from illegal search and seizure. However, federal postal inspectors can get a warrant to open the mail if they have probable cause to believe the contents violate federal law. The 1873 Comstock Act prohibits the mailing of anything that can be used to cause an abortion. It is still on the books. The executive branch holds authority over the US Postal Service. With the president’s nod, the Postal Service could train its dogs to sniff out the little white pills and direct its enforcers to tear open parcels in search of contraband. US Customs is authorized to check international mail for prohibited items – whether that’s gold, fresh fruit, animal fur, or illegal drugs. The 2024 Republican platform may be no more than a script for political theater. But, there’s another document – finally discovered by the media – that shows the party ain’t playing: Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s plan for transition to an extreme-right America under an imperial presidency. All the positions Trump finessed or “softened” in the platform are laid out in flagrant detail in the 900-page tome. Trump has disavowed connection with it, while proudly owning the platform. “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and unlike our very well received Republican platform, had nothing to do with it,” he posted on Truth Social. But CNN found at least 140 people involved in Project 2025 who served in the Trump administration, including six cabinet members. While peeved that the Republican platform committee flouted their input, antiabortion leaders have dismissed it as a temporary setback. “The 2024 platform is a decent statement of campaign priorities,” said Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, “but not necessarily the enduring principles of the party.” Whoever ends up in the White House, the antis will not rest until every baby that can be born is born and anybody who gets in the way is punished – slandered, delicensed, sued, fined, imprisoned, even executed for homicide or, hardly least of all, forced to carry and bear a child they do not want. Republican-dominated state legislatures have indicated their eagerness to enact the most stringent limitations and the harshest penalties. And because the supreme court has immunized presidents from criminal prosecution (with the insane proviso that they commit the crime as an official act), a second-term President Trump would be free to follow his instincts and impose his will over the bodies of women. That’s what he has always done. But this time he will be accountable to nobody.

"abortion","Out-of-state residents made up vast majority of Kansas abortions in 2023","Kansas providers performed a historic number of abortions in 2023 – and most of them were performed on out-of-state residents – in a sign of just how much the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade has rewritten the map of abortion access and led women to flee their home states for the procedure. More than 19,000 abortions took place in Kansas in 2023, a 58% increase from 2022, according to a recent report from the Kansas department of health and environment. Of those, roughly 4,300 abortions were performed on Kansas residents, while about 15,000 were done on out-of-state residents. Most of those out-of-state residents were from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri – three states that neighbor Kansas and have banned virtually all abortions. The increase in Kansas abortions mirrors the national upswing in the procedure. In 2023, the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortions and restrictions, recorded more than 1m US abortions. That’s the highest number documented in a decade. “It really speaks to a bifurcation of access,” Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a Guttmacher Institute data scientist, told the Guardian late last year. “On one hand, you have many states where abortion has gotten incredibly difficult to access – states with total bans, states with six-week bans. Access has gotten much more difficult for people living in those states. And then, on the other hand, you have states with more protective laws where a lot of the things that people have been doing to ameliorate the effects of bans have also increased access to residents of those states.” Kansas has long been a national flashpoint in the debate over US abortions. In 1991, thousands of anti-abortion protesters swarmed the state’s clinics, leading to more than 2,600 arrests. In 2009, an anti-abortion activist shot George Tiller, one of the nation’s most famous abortion providers, to death in Tiller’s Wichita, Kansas, church. More recently, in 2022, Kansas became the first state in the nation to hold a post-Roe ballot measure on abortion rights. The red state stunned the country by voting overwhelmingly in favor of preserving abortion rights. Several other states, including the Republican strongholds of Ohio and Montana, have since gone on to pass pro-abortion ballot measures. In 2024, however, Kansas’s Republican-controlled state legislature overrode the Democratic governor Laura Kelly to pass a bill dramatically expanding the government’s record-keeping of the abortions performed in Kansas. Except in medical emergencies, abortion providers are now required to ask patients to name the most important factor in their decision to get an abortion as well as questions about their marital status, education level, recent experience with domestic violence and whether they have received financial assistance in the last 30 days. Abortion rights supporters have long warned that such extensive record-keeping can stigmatize the procedure and potentially endanger the privacy of abortion patients. Project 2025, a famous wishlist of conservative policy proposals, has suggested increasing the CDC’s national “surveillance” of abortions. The wishlist urges the CDC to cut funds from states that do not supply the agency with information about “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”.","2025-01-09T15:35:50Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/kansas-abortions-roe-texas"
"abortion","Georgia judge says women aren’t ‘community property’ as abortion ban struck down – as it happened","We’re wrapping up our live coverage of US politics for today, but our live coverage of what is happening now in Israel and Lebanon will continue. Some of today’s key events: A Georgia judge struck down Georgia’s restrictive ban on abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, and ruled that abortion care could once again be provided until around 22 weeks of pregnancy. The ruling follows weeks of national scrutiny after a ProPublica investigation of what experts called the “preventable” deaths of two Georgia women, related to the state’s punitive anti-abortion law. Fulton County superior court judge Robert McBurney’s ruling overturning the abortion ban was strongly worded, arguing that, “Women are not some piece of collectively owned community property the disposition of which is decided by majority vote,” and that forcing women to remain pregnant is a kind of “involuntary servitude,” which forces “primarily poor women, which means in Georgia primarily black and brown women – to engage in compulsory labor, ie, the carrying of a pregnancy to term at the government’s behest.” In the wake of Hurricane Helene, as many as 600 people are still unaccounted for, and at least 100 confirmed dead, the White House said. Donald Trump made a series of baseless claims related to the Biden administration’s handling of Hurricane Helene, asserting without evidence that his Democratic rivals “left Americans to drown” and claiming at an election event that Biden had not spoken with Republican Georgia governor Brian Kemp in the wake of the storm. (Kemp told reporters they had spoken.) Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris expressed support for legalizing marijuana. Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, has won the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani’s daughter, who declared: “I’ve been grieving the loss of my dad to [Donald] Trump. I cannot bear to lose our country to him too.” Caroline Rose Giuliani was writing in Vanity Fair, where she lamented how her father, who was once the former president’s personal attorney and trusted adviser, became caught up in the “destructive trail” and chaos of the Trump administration and its aftermath. “I’m unfortunately well suited to remind Americans of just how calamitous being associated with Trump can be, even for those who are convinced he’s on their side,” wrote Giuliani, a California-based film-maker and activist who has frequently taken issue with her father’s political positions. “I am constantly asking myself how America is back here, even considering the possibility of electing Donald Trump again, after all of the damage he has caused, both in office and since. There are unmistakable reminders of Trump’s destructive trail all around us, and it has broken my heart to watch my dad become one of them.” Rudy Giuliani, who became an immensely popular mayor of New York after guiding the city through the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, paid a severe price for promoting Trump’s lies that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent. On Wednesday, Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Tim Walz will debate Republican Vice-Presidential candidate JD Vance for the first time. That debate takes place at 9pm EDT and we will bring it to you live. Here is more on Biden’s comments, from the press pool report: Asked about comments from Donald Trump, who has accused him and Governor Cooper of ignoring Republican-voting areas in their response to Helene, POTUS angrily interjected before pool finished asking the question. “He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying. The governor told him he’s lying. I’ve spoken to the governor, spent time with him, and he told him he’s lying. I don’t know why he does it … that’s simply not true, and it’s irresponsible.” POTUS also defended spending the weekend in Delaware when asked about the matter. He said Wilmington, Delaware is “90 miles from here.” “I was on the phone the whole time,” he added. He also held up what he said was “a list of every resource we’re getting in there” and said the question of most import was “how to get it in.” “It’s hard to get it from point A to point B. It’s hard to get if somebody’s roads are wiped out. None of these are wiped out. There’s no ability to land, there’s no ability to get trucks, and no ability to get a whole range of things.” Donald Trump spoke in front of a furniture store gutted by Hurricane Helene in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, claiming falsely that Georgia’s governor had not been able to reach Joe Biden. Upon landing in Valdosta, Trump claimed to reporters the president was “sleeping” and that Brian Kemp, the governor, was “calling the president and hasn’t been able to get him”. He repeated the claim when speaking in front of the store. Kemp refuted the allegation earlier in the day. He said he had been playing phone tag with vice-president Kamala Harris, but also said: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon and he just said ‘Hey, what do you need?’ … He offered that if there’s other things we need, just to call him directly, which, I appreciate that.” During the White House press briefing on Monday, the homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall said the president offered Kemp “anything” Georgia needed in terms of storm response. “So, if the governor would like to speak to the president again, of course, the president will take his call,” Sherwood-Randall said. Trump traveled to the area with evangelist Franklin Graham and truckloads of relief supplies in tow. “We brought many, many wagons of resources,” he said, without really describing what those resources were beyond a tanker of gasoline and some water. The Billy Graham Evangelical Association did not respond to a request for comment, though its website notes that it has sent chaplains to the affected areas. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins says that Biden has responded to Trump’s baseless claims earlier saying that Governor Kemp Biden had not spoken with Republican Georgia governor Brian Kemp in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Collins reports that, speaking in the Oval Office, Biden said Trump was lying. Collins said Biden spoke angrily, saying: “He is lying. Let me get this straight: he’s lying...I’ve spoken to the governor. I’ve spent time with him and he told me he’s lying. I don’t know why he does this.” Joe Biden has released a statement on crime rates, noting that the rates of homicide and violent crimes have declined, and that the homicide rate, in particular, is falling at “record speed”. The rate of violent crime has declined to its lowest level in 55 years, Biden says. The comments come as Donald Trump is accused of invoking plotlines similar to The Purge – a dystopian horror film in which officially sanctioned murder is occasionally legal – as a possible solution to crime in the US after saying it could be eradicated in “one really violent day”. Biden said, in part: This year, the homicide and violent crime rates have continued their rapid decline from their peaks during the last administration. According to new preliminary data submitted to the FBI, in the first half of this year, the homicide rate continued to fall at record speed, declining by 22.7%, while the violent crime rate fell by 10.3% to its lowest level since 1969. These record decreases follow the historic declines in crime in 2023, including the largest-ever decrease in the homicide rate. Communities across our country are safer now than when I took office. Under the previous administration, we saw the biggest increase in murder rates on record.” This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US politics coverage. Asked about Donald Trump’s claims today that Democratic leaders were failing to help Americans in storm-damageed Republican areas of North Carolina, president Joe Biden said, “He’s lying.” Today’s White House pool reporter noted that, when asked about Trump’s comments, Biden “ angrily interjected” before the reporter was even done with the question. “He’s lying, and the governor told him he was lying,” Biden said. “The governor told him he’s lying. I’ve spoken to the governor, spent time with him, and he told him he’s lying. I don’t know why he does it … that’s simply not true, and it’s irresponsible.” After a Georgia judge’s ruling struck down the state’s restrictive 2019 abortion law, which abortion after roughly around six weeks of pregnancy, advocates and analysts have highlighted the order’s bold arguments, which invoked the Handmaid’s Tale and compared certain kinds of abortion bans to “involuntary servitude” or “compulsory labor.” Some advocates, like senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, have highlighted the broader importance of Georgia allowing access to abortion care through 22 weeks of pregnancy, since many surrounding states in the south also have very restrictive anti-abortion laws. Others, like my colleague Carter Sherman, have noted that this ruling comes after Georgia has made national headlines after a ProPublica investigation into the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who died what experts called “preventable” deaths after delays in care that were related to Georgia’s anti-abortion law. Georgia judge describes ‘subtext of involuntary servitude’ in abortion debate Another key quote from the order, by Fulton county superior court judge Robert McBurney, that overturned Georgia’s restrictive ban on abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy, which state legislators passed in 2019: “There is an uncomfortable and usually unspoken subtext of involuntary servitude swirling about this debate, symbolically illustrated by the composition of the legal teams in this case. It is generally men who promote and defend laws like the Life Act, the effect of which is to require only women – and, given the socio-economic and demographic evidence presented at trial, primarily poor women, which means in Georgia primarily black and brown women – to engage in compulsory labor, ie, the carrying of a pregnancy to term at the government’s behest.” Read my colleague Carter Sherman’s full report here: Who is Judge Robert McBurney, who struck down Georgia’s restrictive abortion ban? It’s not the first time Robert C I McBurney, a Fulton county superior court judge based in Atlanta, has made national headlines. McBurney previously struck down Georgia’s very restrictive ban on abortion at around six weeks of pregnancy and he also presided over parts of the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and key allies, a case that is currently stalled. McBurney, a former federal prosecutor, was appointed to his role in 2012 by Republican governor Nathan Deal, to fill the seat of a judge who was retiring. He has since run for reelection and won. In 2023, a columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution called McBurney “the hardest working judge in Georgia” and said that a joke recently at the Atlanta courthouse was , “Aren’t there any other judges in the county?” McBurney is also set to hear a key case on election regulations in Georgia tomorrow, the Associated Press reports. Georgia judge: ‘Women are not some piece of collectively owned community property’ Some key quotes from the order in which Judge Robert McBurney struck down Georgia’s extremely restrictive abortion ban: Women are not some piece of collectively owned community property the disposition of which is decided by majority vote. … [T]he liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid’s Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could – or should – force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another. … [L]iberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices. More from the Associated Press on the legal reasoning behind the order: Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that ‘liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.’ McBurney wrote that his ruling means the law in the state returns to what it was before the law was passed in 2019: When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then – and only then – may society intervene. An “arbitrary six-week ban” on abortions “is inconsistent with these rights and the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman’s rights of liberty and privacy and society’s interest in protecting and caring for unborn infants”, the order says. Abortions in Georgia can once again be performed through 22 weeks – report After a judge in Georgia struck down the state’s ban on abortions once a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat, which is usually about six weeks into pregnancy, the procedure is once again legal in Georgia through about 22 weeks of pregnancy, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. More context from the Associated Press: When the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Fourteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where the bans kick in after about the first six weeks of pregnancy – which is often before women realize they’re pregnant. A judge in Georgia struck down the state’s ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The law was similar to many passed by Republican-led states after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Democrats, including Kamala Harris, have recently seized on the law as an example of the consequences of electing Donald Trump and the Republicans, after a woman was reported to have died in the state after being denied lifesaving care due to the law. Here’s more on that: As many as 600 people remain missing after Hurricane Helene swept through the south-eastern United States, White House homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall told reporters. “The current data we have is that it looks like there could be as many as 600 loss of lives, but we don’t have any confirmation of that. We know there are 600 who are either lost or unaccounted for, and so that work is ongoing,” Sherwood-Randall said at the White House press briefing. She added that there’s a high degree of uncertainty to the numbers: I’ll caution you, because we’ve seen this before. Those numbers vary widely. There’s a lot of reporting that doesn’t add up about the numbers. And so, while we may see the numbers go up as we get to more locations that have not yet been fully developed in terms of disaster immediate emergency response operations, we may see more people who unfortunately perished, but we may also not see the numbers skyrocket as people have predicted they might. Authorities in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and elsewhere have already confirmed more than 100 deaths from the storm that swept in from the Gulf of Mexico: Donald Trump’s dystopian vision for the United States took a new turn on Sunday, when he mulled adopting something only seen in horror films to fight crime. The Guardian’s Robert Tait has more: Donald Trump has been accused of invoking plotlines similar to The Purge – a dystopian horror film in which officially sanctioned murder is occasionally legal – as a possible solution to crime in the US after saying it could be eradicated in “one really violent day”. In what was seen as an extreme display of demagoguery even by his standards, Trump drew cheers from an audience in Erie, Pennsylvania, with a picture of an out-of-control crime spree that he said could be ended “immediately” with one “real rough, nasty day”, or “one rough hour”. “You see these guys walking out with air conditioners with refrigerators on their back, the craziest thing,” Trump said. “And the police aren’t allowed to do their job. They’re told, if you do anything, you’re gonna lose your pension. “They’re not allowed to do it because the liberal left won’t let them do it. The liberal left wants to destroy them, and they want to destroy our country.” In a passage that provoked a storm on social media, the former president and Republican nominee then said: “If you had one day, like one real rough, nasty day with the drug stores as an example, where, when they start walking out with … ” Further evidence that Donald Trump has no intention of giving the politicking a rest in the wake of Hurricane Helene can be found on X, where he implies, once again without evidence, that North Carolina’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper is frustrating the humanitarian response. “I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,” Trump wrote. North Carolina is considered a swing state in this election, though it has not voted for a Democratic candidate since 2008, and polls there have lately shown Trump with a narrow lead. The governorship seems to be slipping away from GOP candidate Mark Robinson, after CNN broke the news that he had a long history of making lewd and offensive comments on a pornography websites’s message board. Here’s the latest on that fiasco: When he spoke before a furniture store gutted by Hurricane Helene in Valdosta, Georgia, Donald Trump insisted he was not there for political purposes. His social media posts tell a different story. About an hour ago on Truth Social, he seized on the below tweet from Kamala Harris: The former president wrote that the photo of the president was “FAKE and STAGED”, without providing evidence, then went on to accuse both Harris and Joe Biden of leaving “Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South”. “Under this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have ‘leaders’ who have no idea how to lead!” Trump added. Thousands of Americans died in hurricanes that struck Texas, Puerto Rico, and elsewhere during Trump’s presidency. After he left office, a report found that his administration unnecessarily delayed emergency money for Puerto Rico, after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria: Donald Trump attempted to put politics aside as he spoke before a furniture store damaged by Hurricane Helene in Valdosta, Georgia. That’s despite the fact that he had minutes earlier accused Joe Biden of not speaking to the state’s governor Brian Kemp following the storm, even though the White House said the two men spoke on Sunday. “As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election, but in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We’re not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,” Trump said. Kamala Harris made a little bit of news earlier today, saying in an interview that she supported legalizing marijuana – a step even the cannabis-friendly administration of Joe Biden hesitated to embrace. “I just feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed. And we know historically what that has meant and who has gone to jail,” Harris told the All the Smoke podcast. “Second, I just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior.” The vice-president added: “This is not a new position for me. I have felt for a long time we need to legalize it.” The statement represents a break with Biden, who moved to lower restrictions on cannabis while still keeping it broadly illegal at the federal level. Full decriminalization would solve the array of conflicts that have developed as states have moved to legalize marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes. Here’s more on that: In about 30 minutes, Donald Trump will speak from a furniture store in Valdosta, Georgia, a town affected by Hurricane Helene. The former president began his visit to the swing state by falsely claiming that Joe Biden had not spoken to Georgia governor Brian Kemp. Here’s video of the remark, from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: The White House announced yesterday that Biden had spoken to Kemp, a Republican, along with Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s Democratic governor, and Valdosta mayor Scott Matheson. When Tim Walz and JD Vance take the debate stage tomorrow night, expect to see two very different styles of debating, and two equally different views of the nation’s future, the Guardian’s Rachel Leingang reports: When Tim Walz and JD Vance square off as vice-presidential picks on Tuesday, it will be the biggest debate stage for both of the politicians who are newly becoming household names. Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, have been honing their public-speaking skills – and their pointed barbs at each other – in TV appearances and at events around the country in the past few months. Their experiences in electoral debates haven’t reached the levels or notoriety that come along with a presidential campaign, but both have faced opponents in public debates in past elections. Given the tightness of the presidential race, and how poorly the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump went, there will probably be more people tuned in to the vice-presidential debate than in past cycles. While VP debates don’t usually tip the scales much, they could matter in a close race – and they build profiles for lower-profile politicians who will probably stay on the national scene for years to come. On a press call this morning, Tom Emmer, the Republican representative from Minnesota, confirmed he has been playing Tim Walz in JD Vance’s debate prep. Republicans are seeking to frame Walz, the folksy Minnesota governor who has proved to be the most popular figure in the presidential race, as a mean-spirited, ogreish figure. Asked about his portrayal of Walz, Emmer said: “Quite frankly, it’s tough because he is really good on the debate stage.” Emmer, who ran unsuccessfully for Minnesota governor in 2010, added: “[Walz] is going to stand there and he lies with conviction, and he has these little mannerisms where he’s just, hey, I’m the nice guy, but he’s not nice at all.” Emmer predicted that Vance “is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is”. He added: “Tim Walz is nothing more than Gavin Newsom [the governor of California] in a flannel shirt.” Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, predicted that Walz is “going to look to stick the shiv into JD Vance at every opportunity” and predicted that: “The Tim Walz we see tomorrow night will be a completely different character from what we’ve seen so far on the 2024 campaign trail.” Asked whether Donald Trump would agree to debate Kamala Harris for a second time, Miller said Trump “has made it pretty clear where he is”. Harris has accepted an invitation to debate on CNN on 23 October, but Trump, who was widely viewed to have lost the first debate, has claimed that it is “too late” for a second debate. The US Department of Justice has agreed to pay $22.6 million to settle a lawsuit by 34 women who claim they were wrongly dismissed from the FBI’s agent training academy because of their sex, according to a court filing today. The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge in Washington DC, would resolve a 2019 class action claiming the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is part of the Justice Department, had a widespread practice of forcing out female trainees, Reuters reports. The plaintiffs say that they were found unsuitable to graduate from the training academy even though they performed as well as or better than many male trainees on academic, physical fitness, and firearms tests. Some of them also say they were subjected to sexual harassment and sexist jokes and comments. Along with the payout, the proposed settlement would allow eligible class members to seek reinstatement to the agent training program and require the FBI to hire outside experts to ensure that its evaluation process for trainees is fair. Department’s internal watchdog released a report in 2022 finding that female FBI trainees were disproportionately likely to be dismissed and to be cited for conduct “unsuitable” for an agent. Less than one-quarter of FBI special agents are women, the agency said in a report released in April. The man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump after allegedly positioning himself with a rifle outside one of the former president’s Florida golf courses on 15 September pleaded not guilty this morning to five federal charges. Ryan Routh, 58, entered the plea to charges that include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate during a hearing in federal court. He has already been ordered to remain in jail to await a trial, Reuters reports. Prosecutors have said Routh intended to kill Trump as he golfed at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Routh, a struggling roofing contractor, condemned the Republican presidential candidate in a self-published book and dropped off a letter months earlier with an associate referencing an attempted assassination on Trump, according to prosecutors. This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,” the suspect wrote, according to a court filing by prosecutors. Lawyers for Routh suggested at a 23 September court hearing that the letter may have been an attempt by their client at gaining publicity and highlighted what they called Routh’s efforts to promote democracy in Ukraine and Taiwan. Routh is accused of poking a rifle through a fence at the course with the intention to kill Trump. When a federal agent spotted it and fired shots, the suspect fled but was arrested. Joe Biden finished up his remarks on the impact of Hurricane Helene by saying that as US president he had seen many disasters and heard “dozens of stories from survivors”. “I know how it feels to be left with nothing,” he said, “not even knowing where or when you’re back on track. I’m here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes … I urge everyone returning to their communities and homes to listen to the local officials and follow all the safety instructions.” He continued: “Take this seriously, please be safe, your nation has your back and the Biden-Harris administration will be there until the job is done.” In answer to a press question, Biden said no decision has been made yet on whether to ask the US Congress (which is in recess) to come back for a special session to approve additional emergency funding as a result of what he described as the “really, really devastating” storm. He said he had spoken to the governor of North Carolina [Democrat Roy Cooper] and expects to visit the state on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. Donald Trump has been taunting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for not rushing to the areas affected by Hurricane Helene and the storm’s aftermath. Harris has returning early to Washington DC from election campaigning out west, as the Democratic party’s nominee for president since Biden, the sitting president, quit his race for re-election in July. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, plans to go to Valdosta, Georgia, this afternoon to see storm damage. He’s blasted the US president and vice president, saying Biden was “sleeping” on the beach at the weekend instead of marshaling recovery efforts in the devastated areas, while Harris, instead of campaigning in the western US “ought to be down in the area”. It wasn’t possible from the live audio to make out what Biden’s response was to a question about Trump’s remarks. We’ll bring it to you as soon as possible. Biden said he had spoken to all the affected state governors, has promised help to all those affected for “as long as it takes” and had explained how a White House visit to an emergency area too soon can be counterproductive, because it is such a complicated operation. Biden has signed disaster declarations that free up more federal resources for affected areas – and Politico also said he spoke to the mayor of Valdosta at the weekend, as well as state governors. Harris said in Las Vegas, Nevada: “We will stand with these communities for as long as it takes to make sure that they are able to recover and rebuild.” She also plans to visit affected areas in due course. Joe Biden said he expects to visit areas affected by the aftermath of Hurricane Helene “later this week”. The US president is now taking some questions from the press gathered at the White House. He called it a historic storm, “never seen anything like it before”. He said he expected to go down to the area “Wednesday or Thursday”, saying that, including with a press entourage, a presidential visit in the middle of an emergency can be disruptive if made too soon. Biden said at least 10 states had been affected. Despite saying he would only talk about the storm, he did take a question about the Middle East and said “we should have a ceasefire now” in the conflict in Lebanon that has suddenly intensified since Israel has launched fierce airborne attacks in the last almost two weeks on the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia based in Lebanon, labelled as a counteroffensive to Hezbollah’s attacks on its neighbor Israel since last October, in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza. Asked about reports that Israel plans a ground invasion of Lebanon and if he was comfortable with that, Biden said: “I’m comfortable with them stopping.” Our Middle East live blog is here. Here is Joe Biden, talking about “the broad and devastating” impacts of the storm that made landfall as Hurricane Helene. “Communities are devastated, loved ones waiting to hear if [folks] are OK, many unsure if they can return to their homes, when or ever. There is nothing like wondering, is my husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father alive, many more who remain without electricity, water, food and communications,” the US president said. He acknowledged that the death toll from the storm was over 100 and more than 600 were unaccounted for. He is speaking from the White House and explained that he had not gone to the areas of destruction and emergency yet because, in line with normal presidential practice, he does not want to get in the way of the local authorities’ recovery efforts just now. We’re still awaiting Joe Biden’s remarks from the White House about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and the impact of as it roared across Georgia and North and South Carolina and its effects spread across 10 states even as it was downgraded from hurricane status last week. The US president is behind schedule, as he was due to begin speaking half an hour ago, but we’ll keep you abreast of developments. Biden is due to talk to US Olympic athletes at 11.30am and then the White House daily media briefing with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is due at 2pm, so we’ll keep an eye on whether those times are pushed back. CNN just said the death toll from the storm has now reached 115 in the US, and rising, as more deaths are discovered, with whole towns devastated and some blocked off and parts of western North Carolina, in particular, just flattened. Flooding has been the worst lingering effect after the initial 140mph winds began slowing once the hurricane came ashore in north-western Florida late last Thursday as a category 4. The federal government said yesterday that the “historic flooding” was made worse because of global heating as the major part of the climate crisis. Joe Biden is scheduled to imminently begin speaking from the White House about the response to Hurricane Helene’s devastation in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere in the southeast. We’ll let you know what the president has to say. Jeff Flake, a Republican who represented swing state Arizona in the Senate and House of Representatives, endorsed Kamala Harris for president yesterday: Flake clashed with Donald Trump during his presidency, and opted not to run for re-election in 2018, paving the way for then-Democrat Kyrsten Sinema to take his place. The former senator has made his peace with the Democrats, and until earlier this month served as Joe Biden’s ambassador to Turkey. Donald Trump may dismiss it as a “scam”, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes the climate crisis made Hurricane Helene more severe, the Guardian’s Edward Helmore reports: The head of the US disaster relief agency has called Hurricane Helene, which has killed nearly 100 people, a “true multi-state event” that caused “significant infrastructure damage” and had been made worse because of global heating. The storm killed at least 91 people, according to state and local officials in South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Officials feared more bodies would be discovered. “This is going to be a really complicated recovery in each of the five states” of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) administrator, Deanne Criswell. She noted that a 15ft storm surge hit Florida’s Taylor county, where Helene came ashore as a category 4 hurricane late Thursday with winds of 140mph (225km/h), and pointed out that areas of western North Carolina, where search and rescue operations are continuing, recorded 29in (74cm) of rain when the storm stalled over the region. “This is historic flooding up in North Carolina,” Criswell told the CBS show Face the Nation on Sunday. “I don’t know that anybody could be fully prepared for the amount of flooding and landslides they are having right now.” Despite Donald Trump’s insistence to the contrary, the White House says Kamala Harris was briefed on Hurricane Helene’s impacts as she was campaigning over the weekend on the west coast. Harris has canceled campaign events in Las Vegas today so she can head to Fema headquarters in Washington DC for a briefing on the storm, a White House official said. She has also spoken to North Carolina’s governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and “contacted” Georgia and Florida’s Republican governors Brian Kemp and Ron DeSantis. “The vice-president intends to visit impacted communities as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations,” the official added. Donald Trump’s rally in Erie, Pennsylvania yesterday stretched for nearly two hours, and began with the former president accusing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris of failing to respond as Hurricane Helene struck the southeastern United States. “Biden is in Delaware sleeping right now in one of his many estates,” Trump said, before alleging Harris was “at fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors, when big parts of our country have been devastated by that massive hurricane and are underwater, with many, many people dead”. Here’s the moment: Harris’s campaign has thus far held back on making similar statements about Trump, but did seize on his comments downplaying the link between worsening natural disasters and climate change: Good morning, US politics blog readers. After churning across the southern US and causing massive destruction and dozens of deaths in North Carolina, Georgia and elsewhere, Hurricane Helene appears set to collide with the presidential campaign. Donald Trump will speak this afternoon in Valdosta, Georgia about the storm, undoubtedly with an eye on turning the swing state’s voters away from Kamala Harris. The former president has already made the hurricane’s destruction into an attack line on the Democrats, reportedly accusing Joe Biden of “sleeping” as the storm raged. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania yesterday he also accused Harris of turning a blind eye to the destruction. Biden plans to speak from the White House at 10.30am ET about his administration’s response to the storm, while Harris has announced the cancellation of campaign events in Las Vegas today so she can return to Washington DC and be briefed on the storm’s impact at Fema headquarters. She’ll arrive just after 5pm. Here’s what else is happening today: Harris’s economic policies are more popular with voters than Trump’s, new polling commissioned by the Guardian finds. The vice-president laid out her plans in a major speech last week. The vice-presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz is set for tomorrow evening, with both candidates preparing for what is currently the last scheduled debate before the election. Israel may or may not be on the verge of launching a ground invasion of Lebanon.

"abortion","‘Trust me’: ‘pro-life’ Queensland LNP candidate hints at post-election push to change abortion laws","A Liberal National party candidate for the Queensland election has been recorded telling a voter “I am pro-life” and claiming that abortion “can increase the risk of breast cancer”, but that she couldn’t “say anything yet because we have got to get elected”. The audio of Stretton LNP candidate Freya Ostapovitch, secretly recorded at a pre-poll booth this week, was obtained by Guardian Australia on Friday. The Labor deputy premier, Cameron Dick, said the candidate’s comments “should send a chill down the spine of every person in Queensland”. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, has been dogged by more than 132 questions in the past week over the issue of abortion, but made a “personal guarantee” that abortion laws would not change under an LNP government. Crisafulli told the Queensland Media Club he could be “definitive” on the issue – despite not ruling out a conscience vote – because “I’ve got a team that backs that position”. On the recording, Ostapovitch initially tells a voter “we need to get tougher on crime, it’s out of control”. The elector tells her “my issue is that the LNP is not coming harder down on the abortion stuff”. “You vote for me, you trust me,” Ostapovitch responds. “I can’t say anything yet because we have got to get elected before we do anything. “I am on the record, I am pro-life. This babies born alive stuff, it just breaks my heart.” The former psychiatric nurse was the MP for Stretton after winning the seat in the Campbell Newman wave election, but lost it in 2015. In a late-night speech in parliament in 2014, Ostapovitch claimed that abortion reduced “protective factors” against breast cancer. The claim has been widely debunked. “Why are women not informed of these basic facts so that they can avoid induced abortions and thus lower their risk of breast cancer?” she said, citing a 2013 study of Chinese women. “I hope that this speech will raise awareness and get the conversation started.” In the recording, she tells the voter she was “humiliated” while an MP and “made the news” while talking about women’s health and breast cancer. “One of the things they say can increase the risk of breast cancer is abortion…” “I don’t know how they don’t understand its a life”. Dick told ABC Radio National on Friday that Ostapovitch had “come out and [told] the truth today about abortion” and the LNP was “full of anti-abortion activists”. “These people want to make it a crime to have a termination of pregnancy,” he said. Premier Steven Miles said on Friday: “The LNP are saying one thing before the election, but intend to do something else after the election. And that’s what this candidate has done, is just say what they’re all thinking.” Crisafulli told media on Friday that he had ruled out changes to abortion and “Freya is committed to that”. “I want Queenslanders to know that is the position of our team. There will be no change to the abortion act; that’s not a periphery, that’s not wriggle room. There will be no change to the abortion act, and that is the position of our team”. Ostapovitch said: “Don’t fall for Labor’s desperate scare campaign. As a member of the LNP team I have committed to no changes to these laws and I will stand by that position if elected.” All but three LNP MPs voted against legalising abortion in 2018, including Crisafulli and deputy Jarrod Bleijie. They have not said how they would vote on a Katter’s Australian party bill on the issue, to be introduced in the next parliament, or ruled out a conscience vote.","2024-10-17T23:55:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/qld-election-2024-freya-ostapovitch-lnp-stretton-candidate-abortion-ntwnfb"

A South Australian bill to ban late-stage abortions was narrowly defeated in the state’s upper house last night – we look at what it was all about, and how it got so close. Anthony Albanese may have brought pressure on himself to consider changing tax concessions after his controversial home purchase, Kamala Harris calls it like she sees it, and can the King’s visit revitalise the republican movement? Australia Moon watch | The October full moon that will rise in the sky tonight, also known as the hunter’s moon, will be the third of four back-to-back supermoons. Here’s how you can see it. Abortion bill defeated | By the narrowest margin of 10 votes to nine, South Australia’s upper house last night voted to reject legislation that would force women seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days – an extremely rare occurrence – to be induced, to deliver the child alive, and keep it or adopt it out. Exclusive | Guardian Australia has seen training videos and documents that outline the bizarre recruitment methods used by the Korean Shincheonji church, which include calling recruits “fruit” and recruiters “leaves”, and which former members claim amount to coercive control.

"abortion","Complete abortion ban in South Carolina more likely after primaries","The right to legal abortion in South Carolina is in a “dire” condition, said the state senator Penry Gustafson, who lost her seat on Tuesday to a primary challenger prepared to vote to ban abortion at conception. Gustafson is one of five female lawmakers dubbed the “sister senators” who blocked legislation to outlaw abortion from the point of conception in the state. The three Republicans among them – Gustafson, Sandy Senn and Katrina Shealy – each drew male primary challengers who competed for conservative primary voters seeking more restrictive abortion access. Senn also lost on Tuesday to a primary challenger, state representative Matt Leber, by 31 votes. Results in that race will go through a mandatory recount. If two or more senators are replaced by supporters of a complete abortion ban, opponents will no longer have enough votes in the senate to block it. South Carolina currently has a six-week “heartbeat” standard, which the group of female senators have said they believe is too restrictive and unpopular even among South Carolina conservatives. Leber questions that argument. “I think our current abortion laws reflect the values of South Carolina and the low country in general,” Leber said. South Carolina’s ban an abortion after embryonic cardiac activity can be detected provides exceptions for rape up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, for incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly and in cases protecting the mother’s life. South Carolina’s supreme court struck down the state’s six-week abortion ban in January 2023, ruling it a violation of the right to privacy under the state constitution despite the US supreme court overturning Roe v Wade’s abortion protections a year earlier. State lawmakers called a special session in May 2023 to draft new legislation. The three Republican “sister senators”, none of whom can credibly be described as pro-choice, had each voted for the original “heartbeat” legislation, but argued in the special session for fewer restrictions on abortion and blocked legislation calling for a ban at contraception. The South Carolina state senate requires three-fifths of its 46 members to vote to end debate; three Republican crossovers were enough to filibuster the bill. Asked whether he would vote for a bill barring abortion at conception, Leber replied: “Well, I am a Christian. I do believe that life begins at conception. I just don’t think we have that mandate.” But he said he would not discuss hypothetical legislation. Only six women currently serve among South Carolina’s 46 state senators, among the smallest proportion of any state, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. Shealy, who has served in the senate for 12 years, came in first in a three-way race but did not win a majority. She will face Carlisle Kennedy, an assistant solicitor, in a 25 June runoff. Gustafson flipped a traditionally Democratic district four years ago. After legislative redistricting, she lost much of the territory where she was most familiar to voters. She lost a primary challenge 82-18 on Tuesday night to Allen Blackmon, a second-term Lancaster county council member. Her loss represents political regression, she said. “South Carolina is in trouble,” she said. “We’ve been set back … I don’t know how much time, maybe decades … in our advances with women and our voices representing our state.” Recounts rarely overturn election results. Officials will begin retabulating the roughly 8,000 votes after the election is certified by the state on Friday, officials said. Turnout in the primary statewide was about 11%. “Moderate Republicans didn’t vote,” Gustafson said. “That was particularly disheartening and disruptive.” Low-turnout primaries create results that reward more politically extreme candidates and more politically extreme messaging. The well-watched race between Senn and Leber, in the suburban middle-class outskirts of fast-growing Charleston, was looked to as a bellwether for conservative appetites on the abortion question. But it was also a bruising affair. In a Trump-inflected campaign, Leber described Senn as a quasi-Democrat who was insufficiently anti-abortion. Senn argued that Leber was a political extremist with connections to militia groups – which Leber denied – and argued erroneously that Leber had faked his college degree. Senn did not return calls and email seeking comment. Gustafson described Leber in stark terms as a purveyor of radical rhetoric. “Matt Leber is a nutcase. He is scary,” she said. “He wants women who get an abortion to be in prison. He is awful. I don’t know what the hell he’s going to do in our state senate. Our senate is not like that.” In response to Gustafson’s comments, Leber said: “It is not my position that women should be punished for abortions … ever.” National observers have been looking for signs of a liberal backlash to the fall of Roe v Wade protections, as was seen in referendums in Kansas, Ohio and elsewhere erecting new abortion-rights protections. But that backlash is not happening within Republican primary circles, at least not in South Carolina, Leber said. “There was a backlash,” Leber said. “And Senator Senn lost her seat.” • This article was amended on 13 June 2024. The South Carolina state senate has 46 members, not 48.","2024-06-13T10:00:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/13/south-carolina-abortion-ban"
"abortion","UK anti-abortion campaigners running against MPs who back decriminalisation","Anti-abortion campaigners are running as independent candidates in the general election against prominent MPs seeking re-election who supported decriminalisation. The seats of Labour’s Diana Johnson and Stella Creasy and Conservative Caroline Nokes are all being targeted by anti-abortion activists. The three proposed or supported recent amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill which would have stopped prosecutions for anyone ending a pregnancy in England and Wales. The vote was described by abortion provider British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) as “the biggest on abortion rights in a generation”, but it never went ahead as the general election was called and parliament was dissolved. Creasy is being challenged in Walthamstow by Ruth Rawlins from the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (CBRUK), a group which also launched a #StopStella campaign in 2019 after the MP successfully led a vote for abortion rights in Northern Ireland. At the time, Creasy said she had contacted police after being targeted by anti-abortion protesters in her constituency. Creasy told the Observer she would want a police presence at local hustings if Rawlins were to participate. “In a democracy, candidates must be able to put themselves forward for office and for scrutiny without fear of harm. That principle covers us all, and I have made it clear to hustings organisers that I am happy to participate alongside those who hold anti-abortion views,” she said. “It’s sad but necessary, given the history of intimidating and threatening behaviour from the CBRUK, that a police presence would be required for them to take part in such a debate.” Rawlins said any accusations of harassment were false and that campaigners were “simply sharing with [Creasy’s] constituents her extreme abortion position”. A CBRUK spokesperson added that no charges had been brought as a result of police investigating the complaint made by Stella Creasy about anti-abortion protests in her constituency. Hull North and Cottingham, where Johnson is Labour’s candidate, is being contested by Pauline Peachey, founder of CBRUK’s Post Abortion Support for Everyone (PASE) project. Johnson said she would continue to pursue decriminalisation if elected, to “bring our laws out of the Victorian era and in line with other countries from Northern Ireland, to Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and France”. Abortions in England and Wales must be approved by two doctors and take place within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Otherwise, it is illegal to deliberately end a pregnancy, under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Data from BPAS earlier this year showed that while only three women had been convicted of having an illegal abortion in more than five decades between 1967 and 2022, six had been prosecuted in the 18 months to February. “Victims of domestic abuse, human trafficking and sexual exploitation, as well as girls under 18, have been subjected to humiliating and dehumanising interrogations and detainment under the suspicion of ending their own pregnancies illegally,” Johnson said. “Should I be re-elected, I look forward to working with colleagues, medical bodies, and abortion providers to continue work in this space.” In Romsey and Southampton North, Caroline Nokes’s former seat, Fennie Yap is running as an independent, with a campaign fundraiser comparing abortion to genocide. Alex Davies-Jones, who is seeking re-election as a Labour MP, is being challenged in Pontypridd, Wales, by Joseph Biddulph, a longstanding member of the Pro-Life Alliance. Other MPs seeking re-election whose seats are being targeted include Labour’s Zarah Sultana and Rosena Allin-Khan. Some of the anti-abortion candidates are coordinated by the Vote Life campaign founded by Christian Hacking, a former public engagement officer at CBRUK and a prominent protester outside London abortion clinics. He is also running as an independent candidate in new constituency Eltham and Chislehurst. Hacking said it was “high time this genocide is made a voting issue”. The Christian Peoples Alliance, a registered political party which includes among its aims “upholding the sanctity of life from conception until natural death”, also has 22 candidates running in constituencies in England. Dr Jonathan Lord, co-chair of the British Society of Abortion Care Providers, said the candidacies were “sadly part of [a] trend”. He said: “That said, given that the overwhelming majority of the public support abortion care, they will soon get a resounding message from voters as to what the public think of their extreme views.” Last month a 25-year-old woman appeared in court in Gloucestershire accused of illegally ending a pregnancy six years earlier as a teenager. Heidi Stewart, chief executive of BPAS, said it was “for people like this young woman that we need decriminalisation as a matter of urgency”. She said that BPAS would continue its work towards decriminalisation after the election. “As police prosecutions and investigations into illegal abortion reach record highs, our hopes are not dashed, they are delayed. It is never in the public interest to investigate and prosecute women for illegal abortions. “Come the new parliament, we will be picking up where we left off and progressing the decriminalisation of abortion for women as soon as possible Abortion law was devolved to the Scottish parliament in 2016. No amendments have been made to the Abortion Act since, but MSPs last week passed a law creating safe access zones around facilities providing abortions in Scotland. Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019, though barriers to access remain. Ikamara Larasi, co-lead for the Abortion is Healthcare campaign from activist group Level Up, said it was “disappointing” that the parliamentary vote was not going ahead and that the group would continue to back calls for decriminalisation. “I’m confident with all the work that’s gone into this that we will see it happen. The law is not the only thing needed in terms of reproductive justice, but it’s a really significant part of the puzzle,” she said. • This article was amended on 16 June 2024 to correctly refer to Christian Hacking as a former public engagement officer at CBRUK. It was further amended on 17 June 2024 to reflect a response from CBRUK stating that no charges had been brought in relation to the complaint made by Stella Creasy about anti-abortion protests in her constituency.","2024-06-15T11:00:19Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/15/uk-anti-abortion-campaigners-running-against-mps-who-back-decriminalisation"
"abortion","Italy denies removing LGBTQ and abortion references from G7 declaration","Italy’s far-right government has denied that it removed references to abortion and LGBTQ rights in the final declaration of the G7 summit in Puglia. In the declaration, published late on Friday, a reference to the protection of the “gender identity and sexual orientation” of the LGBTQ community did not appear, although reference had been included in the final declaration of the G7 in Japan last year. The word “abortion” was also left out of a broader commitment to “universal access to adequate, affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all”. In last year’s communique, G7 leaders had explicitly committed to addressing “access to safe and legal abortion”. Bloomberg, which first reported on the removed LGBTQ passage, linked the removal to the involvement in the summit of Pope Francis, with whom the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has bonded over LGBTQ and abortion issues. It is the first time a pontiff has addressed a G7 meeting. “The news published by Bloomberg, according to which any reference to the rights of LGBT people could be removed from the final G7 communique, is devoid of any foundation,” Meloni’s office said. “The Italian presidency [of the G7] categorically denies this reconstruction.” The allegation followed a clash between Meloni and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after Italy was accused of diluting a reference to guaranteeing access to “safe and legal” abortions in the G7’s final text. The clause had also been agreed by the G7 members in Japan. Sources in Meloni’s office denied that the reference had been removed, saying on Thursday that the declaration was still being negotiated and that “everything that will be included in the final document will be final points resulting from the negotiations”. Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the event that he “regretted” the removal of the reference. “You don’t have the same sensibilities in your country,” Macron said to an Italian journalist. “France has a vision of equality between women and men, but it’s not a vision shared by all the political spectrum.” Meloni hit back by accusing Macron, who called a snap election after a surge by France’s far right in the European elections, of using the G7 for “electioneering”, according to reports in the Italian press. Since taking power in October 2022, Meloni’s government has introduced policies against the LGBTQ community, such as a crackdown on same-sex parenting, and in April approved a law allowing anti-abortion activists to enter abortion clinics. In early May, Meloni vehemently defended the Italian families minister, Eugenia Roccella, after she was heckled by student protesters over the government’s stance on abortion during a conference on how to reverse Italy’s declining birthrate.

"abortion","US supreme court unanimously upholds access to abortion pill mifepristone","The availability of a common abortion pill will remain unchanged, the US supreme court ruled on Thursday in a unanimous 9-0 decision, handing a major victory to abortion rights supporters who feared that the court that overturned Roe v Wade just two years ago would further hack away at access to the procedure. Conservative bloc Alito – Majority Barrett – Majority Gorsuch – Majority Kavanaugh – Majority Roberts – Majority Thomas – Majority Liberal bloc Jackson – Majority Kagan – Majority Sotomayor – Majority The case, a consolidation of Food and Drug Administration v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and Danco Laboratories LLC v Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, dealt with the FDA’s ability to regulate mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in medication abortions, which now make up more than 60% of all US abortions and have become a major target of anti-abortion activists. A coalition of abortion opponents had tried to persuade the supreme court to roll back a series of moves by the FDA to expand access to the drug, such as allowing abortion providers to mail mifepristone to patients – a request that the justices met with skepticism in the case’s March arguments. The abortion opponents claimed that, if the FDA’s current regulations of mifepristone were allowed to remain, anti-abortion doctors could suffer harm if they have to treat women who experience complications from mifepristone. But in Thursday’s majority opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh rejected that argument, ruling that the anti-abortion activists did not prove that they had the legal right, or standing, to bring the case in the first place. “Because the plaintiffs do not prescribe, manufacture, sell, or advertise mifepristone or sponsor a competing drug, the plaintiffs suffer no direct monetary injuries from FDA’s actions relaxing regulation of mifepristone,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Nor do they suffer injuries to their property, or to the value of their property, from FDA’s actions. Because the plaintiffs do not use mifepristone, they obviously can suffer no physical injuries from FDA’s actions relaxing regulation of mifepristone.” The unanimous ruling marked a rare moment of consensus on abortion. Only Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the most hardline conservative justices on the court, wrote a concurring opinion that dealt primarily with the legal nuances of standing, arguing that so-called “abortionists” – a term widely seen as derogatory among abortion providers – should also lack standing to sue on behalf of their patients. Rightwing judges have long complained that it is too easy for abortion providers to challenge restrictions on the procedure, according to Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the legal history of reproduction. But given the supreme court’s 6-3 conservative majority, she said “no abortion provider in their right mind is going to be spending a lot of time trying to litigate to get to the supreme court now”. Members of Congress hailed the decision. “This is a massive victory for abortion access, but there is no question – we must codify access to reproductive care nationwide,” Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, posted on X. “This challenge to mifepristone was meritless from the start. Abortion medication is safe and effective,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, added on X. “Make no mistake: Donald Trump and Republican politicians will not stop marching us toward a nationwide abortion ban. We must protect reproductive freedom everywhere.” Although the ruling did please abortion rights activists, many had similar reactions to Warren. “We’re relieved that the supreme court recognized this sham case for what it is, but this baseless push to block abortion access should never have been heard by them in the first place,” Mini Timmaraju, CEO and president of Reproductive Freedom for All, said. “We need court reform to salvage the legitimacy of our federal judiciary – and we won’t stop fighting for it until it’s a reality.” Given that the outcome of the case rested on standing, there is a chance that other plaintiffs may continue challenging access to mifepristone. Three states have already joined the case as plaintiffs at a lower-court level. If Donald Trump wins the presidency in November, he may also try to restrict access to mifepristone through a 19th-century anti-obscenity law. The supreme court has also not yet ruled on its second abortion case from this term, which deals with a federal law that mandates that hospitals stabilize the health of patients who show up at their emergency rooms with medical emergencies. The Biden administration and the state of Idaho have clashed over whether this law requires doctors to perform emergency abortions. “Today’s decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues. It does not change the fact that the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom,” Joe Biden said in a statement. “It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.” The president, as he has repeatedly done from his re-election campaign trail, called on Congress to codify Roe’s protections into law. Had the abortion opponents won, the ruling could have had consequences for every medication regulated by the FDA, including other kinds of politicized drugs such as vaccines, HIV medications and drugs used in gender-affirming healthcare. Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of mifepristone and a petitioner in the case, applauded Thursday’s opinion, which reversed and remanded a ruling from the fifth circuit court of appeals that would have rolled back the FDA’s efforts to expand mifepristone access. “By rejecting the fifth circuit’s radical, unprecedented and unsupportable interpretation of who has standing to sue, the justices reaffirmed longstanding basic principles of administrative law,” Abigail Long, an executive at Danco, said in a statement. “In doing so, they maintained the stability of the FDA drug approval process, which is based on the agency’s expertise and on which patients, healthcare providers and the US pharmaceutical industry rely.”","2024-06-13T21:14:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/13/supreme-court-abortion-pill-access"
"abortion","Hurdy Gurdy by Jenny Ackland review – a toothless abortion tale","In courts and legislatures across the US – including in the supreme court – conservative lawmakers are debating just how close to death a woman must be before she can access an emergency abortion when the procedure is otherwise banned. How much suffering must she endure? How much irreparable damage? Which of her organs is dispensable? Which bodily functions are truly essential? What would be enough mortal risk? Enough mortal terror? There is no viable foetus in these cases, no promise of new life – just a dying woman forced to prove she has a life worth saving. It’s the bureaucracy of it that chills me most, the bloodless, paper-pushing cruelty. When the real world is so grotesque, it is hard not to be frustrated – bordering on furious – when a novel like Jenny Ackland’s Hurdy Gurdy crosses your desk, and not for the reasons that Ackland might wish. Her new novel is a toothless abortion fable. A sheep in wolf’s clothing. It is the near future – a time of “infections and inquisitions” – and Australia is a fire-ravaged dustbowl. The sun is dulled by a perpetual haze. The birds are gone. Democracy has all but crumbled and the country’s class inequalities have turned septic. In the capital cities, billionaires slurp down opulent cocktails. In the regions, the internet connection is (still) terminally glitchy, and an itinerant economy has reappeared: a workforce of tinkers, swaggies, travelling salesmen, smugglers, bush-cooks and tincture-peddling quacks. Life is rough out here in the (oddly nostalgic) colonial redux: the men are feral, the women are fearful and every womb is a battlefield. (First Nations folk? Virtuously mentioned, but narratively absent.) We follow a circus troupe – a ragtag group of women who rumble around the backroads with a caravan of tricks and an ageing tiger. By day, they run a mobile beauty salon that doubles as an abortion clinic. By night, they stage a show with all the big-top trimmings: wire walking, high diving, clowns. (“Clowns are the only ones who can tell truth to power,” Ackland writes, “wrapped as a joke”.) When the women encounter a particularly heinous man on their travels – a wife-beater or child molester – they offer him a “free shave” and the tiger eats well that night. But rumours are spreading, and someone dangerous is paying attention, a self-appointed warrior for the unborn. A vigilante showdown is brewing: harlequins versus holy fanatics. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning This is profoundly tropey territory – the greatest hits of ruination. Station Eleven, The Natural Way of Things, Red Clocks, The Animals in that Country, Praiseworthy, The Power, Wake in Fright, The Road, The Last Circus on Earth: they’re all in here, and then some. (There’s Atwood, of course; there’s always Margaret Atwood.) Some of Ackland’s references are deeply intentional (Ackland’s grand villain has a handmaid). A great many are unavoidable. It’s a sign of our times that it is becoming harder to invent new ways to torture fictional women, and easier to imagine how the world will end. “Whatever has been done will be done again,” Ackland writes of her dust-burned country. “The world can’t invent any more terrible things because they already exist and always have. It means that nothing is coming to save us, but also that whatever will destroy us is already here.” If tales like Hurdy Gurdy are feminist – and that’s a slippery question – then it feels like a masochistic kind of empowerment. I do not need imagined horrors to burnish my rage. Perhaps I did once, before I knew what I know. Perhaps these books are the reason I know what I know. They certainly keep coming. And coming. All-you-can-eat patriarchies. Weaponised patriarchies. Theocratic patriarchies. Technocratic patriarchies. Post-apocalyptic patriarchies. Copy-cat patriarchies. Books like Hurdy Gurdy are scratching a ferocious cultural itch (or perhaps salving a ferocious cultural wound). I want to honour the impulse, yet question the narrative logic: that we must brutalise women on the page to prove how women are brutalised in the world we live in. But what bothers me most about Ackland’s third novel is not its derivative horrorshow. Rather, it’s the book’s sly comforts – its moral coddling. And there is so much coddling here, so many bite-sized lessons and allegorical signposts. The hurdy-gurdy of Ackland’s title is a discordant musical instrument that sounds “like having two things in your head and they might be opposite, but you manage to let them both stay”. It’s a blunt force metaphor for the cognitive dissonance of abortion, and it tells us nothing we do not already know in our bones: abortion is ugly, and inevitable. We meet a harried mother with too many mouths to feed; a pregnant victim of incest; a young girl who will die of sepsis because she took matters into her own hands (the classic high school debate trio). We slide down some ethical slippery slopes, learn the dark price of revenge, encounter a cartoonish zealot or two, and land very neatly in the limp and decorous middle: “It is possible to think a thing is necessary and right,” our narrator explains, “and not want to do it.” Yep. Sure. Great. Thanks. Tell me some more about clowns, while I try to calculate just how many women on this planet aren’t in charge of their bodies. Am I being unfair to Ackland? I’ve been grappling with this question for weeks now, trying to pin my fury down. Sometimes a piece of art comes along that crystallises all of your cultural misgivings. That is what has happened here. There are many perfectly commendable things to say about Hurdy Gurdy (and its perfectly commendable intentions), and I’m sure that other people will say them. But Ackland’s future fable will change no minds and shake no certainties. Anti-abortion readers won’t go near it. Pro-choice readers will feel mildly righteous. This book has been called “timely”. It is decades too late. Hurdy Gurdy by Jenny Ackland is published by Allen and Unwin in Australia, $32.99","2024-06-13T15:00:27Z","https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/13/hurdy-gurdy-by-jenny-ackland-review-a-toothless-abortion-tale"
"abortion","Italy accused of scrapping safe abortion guarantee from G7 declaration","Giorgia Meloni’s government has been accused of scrapping a reference guaranteeing access to “safe and legal” abortions in the text of the G7 summit’s final declaration. Citing sources from G7 member delegations, the Italian media reported on Thursday that a sidebar clause on abortion rights had been left out of a last draft of the final declaration circulated on Wednesday. The clause, pushed especially by France and Canada, had been intended to reinforce an agreement by the G7 members in Japan last year that they would guarantee “effective and safe access to abortion”. It also committed to sexual and reproductive health rights for all, “including by addressing access to safe and legal abortion and post-abortion care”. Sources in Meloni’s office denied that the reference had been removed, telling Ansa news agency that the declaration was still being negotiated and that “everything that will be included in the final document will be final points resulting from the negotiations”. Antonio Tajani, Italy’s deputy prime minister, told Sky TG24: “The various delegations are in talks and it is premature to make an analysis and useless to make predictions. We will see what the agreement will be.” He emphasised that while abortion would be discussed at the G7, Ukraine and the Middle East were priorities. A source close to the negotiations told AFP that since 2021 there had “been a mention of ‘safe access’” but “Meloni doesn’t want it”. “She’s the only one, she’s isolated on the issue. But since it’s the host country, the others have decided not to make it a casus belli,” the source said, using the Latin term for an act that provokes a war. “So it won’t come back in the text.” A high-ranking European diplomat told the Spanish newspaper El País: “We are facing a clear clash of values between G7 members. It very unfortunate that the language on abortion has been weakened. It is the duty of the G7 to show leadership in promoting those values, not to backtrack on them.” The final declaration will not be published until late on Friday. It is not the first time Italy has clashed with others on abortion. In April, a Guardian report on a measure by Meloni’s government to allow anti-abortion activists to enter abortion consultation clinics prompted a spat between Italy and Spain. The clash came weeks after Spain’s Socialist-led government brought in legislation to criminalise the harassment or intimidation of women going for an abortion, with penalties of up to a year in prison. Posting a translation of the Guardian article on social media, Spain’s minister of equality criticised Meloni’s government for moving in the opposite direction. “Allowing organised harassment against women who want to terminate their pregnancies undermines a right that is recognised by law,” Ana Redondo wrote on X. “It’s the strategy of the far right; to intimidate so as overturn rights and put the brakes on equality between men and women.” Meloni was swift to hit back. “Several times I’ve listened to foreign ministers talk about internal Italian matters without knowing the full facts,” she told reporters in Brussels. “Usually when people are ignorant about a certain topic they should at least have the good sense not to impart lessons on others.” Traditionally Catholic Italy legalised abortion in 1978 under Law 194. Although Meloni has promised not to change the legislation, accessing a safe abortion in Italy is difficult for women owing to the high number of gynaecologists who refuse to terminate pregnancies for moral or religious reasons. According to health ministry data from 2021, about 63% of gynaecologists refuse to perform the procedure.","2024-06-13T10:27:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/13/giorgia-meloni-italy-accused-of-scrapping-safe-abortion-guarantee-from-g7-declaration"
"abortion","Selling the left’s message in the digital age is an art – Ireland’s new president mastered it","Last weekend, Ireland elected as its next president a leftwing pacifist in the latest example of how Ireland has bucked the global trends of rightwing populism. This was not a parliamentary election – although Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate, managed to unite leftwing parties, some previously at loggerheads – behind her. And presidential elections in Ireland are different. The office itself is largely ceremonial, but the figurehead is seen as the conscience of Irish society. The Irish electorate – at least since 1990, when Mary Robinson became Ireland’s first female president (she was followed by Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins) – has a tendency to choose progressive presidents with intellectual heft. My own theory of who emerges victorious in Irish presidential elections is that they are thematic to the vanguard of prevailing social values: Robinson the feminist, McAleese the bridge builder between north and south, Higgins the socialist poet, and now Connolly, the anti-war president. As in many societies, there’s a sense in Ireland that governmental politics rarely cross over into people’s lives. So how did a leftwing politician cut through the apathy and capture a broad coalition of voters? And what lessons does her victory hold for progressives elsewhere? Connolly’s strength was her authenticity. Her personal story shaped her views about social justice and equality. She grew up in a large working-class family, raised by a widowed father in a council house on the outskirts of Galway. But although she is 68, and a seasoned politician and lawyer, Connolly was able to tickle voters’ attention with organically viral videos displaying her deft soccer and basketball skills. She is a keen runner and swimmer, with a marathon personal-best time of three hours 36 minutes. Her team requested that she halt her rollerblading hobby lest she get injured during the campaign. She is not a crowd-rallying orator but a softly spoken woman given to nuance. She shirked soundbites, beyond repeating that she was representing a movement of a “new republic” and that she was an independent candidate with an independent mind. That movement is an ongoing cultural, social and political evolution in Ireland, where although far-right agitation is a feature of society, the electorate is shifting left, a Celtic revival underpins a good deal of popular culture, the Irish language is in ascendence and people now speak of Irish unity in real, not just romantic, terms. Connolly’s vibe appealed to voters bored with centre-right politicians whose overly generic messages are honed to the point of blandness. Connolly’s politics are unapologetically on the left, and consistently so. She has repeatedly spoken out against war and militarisation, is highly critical of the EU’s response to what is accepted in Ireland as the genocide of Palestinians, and called out the US for funding and arming it. Her campaign videos centred the Palestinian solidarity movement in Ireland. She said she supported the marriage equality referendum in 2015 and the abortion rights referendum in 2018. She has also repeatedly raised the climate emergency, disability rights, Ireland’s housing crisis and the importance of the Irish language being valued, and articulated a positive vision for society rooted in equality. When faced with apparent controversies, Connolly has stood by her judgment and, instead of flip-flopping, refused to backtrack, giving nuanced reasons for her thinking and behaviour. Unlike the centre-right Fine Gael party, which backed her opponent, she did not engage in negative campaigning and instead struck an optimistic tone, and remained calm in debates. Connolly has been culturally attuned. She broke out of carefully choreographed media set pieces and took instead to popular podcasts for long interviews in which she told the story of her background and spoke about her vision for a presidency built on progressive values. Her campaign leaned into the organising strategies of a grassroots movement rather than a centralised party machine. It learned from the decentralised volunteer networks used to huge effect during Ireland’s marriage equality and abortion referendums to mobilise canvassers around the country. This allowed people to organically take up the cause – folk-musician fundraisers in rural pubs, murals, memes, student organisers rallying the troops, and Instagram and TikTok influencers gravitating towards her campaign’s philosophy, giving it momentum as they communicated its message back to their audiences. Her campaign, as all successful movements are, was porous. Connolly’s team understood visual culture as the dominant form of online communication, but also the motifs within that visual culture that appeal to younger people. This meant shirking the early-2000s and 2010s styles of political branding. The campaign design had Celtic-motif flourishes and was inspired by traditional Irish shopfront signage, echoing New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s hand-painted bodega sign references. In an interview with online news outlet the Journal, Anna Cassidy, the 26-year-old graphic designer who created the brand identity for Connolly’s campaign, said: “It proves that design can tell a story, carry a message, and connect with people on both an emotional and cultural level.” Connolly will not have power to address the housing crisis, the dominant political and social issue in Ireland today. But she did talk about it. In reaching people where they are, using the language and imagery they communicate in, she has shaken the political establishment’s methods and demonstrated how an authentic connection with voters can be fostered with positive, sophisticated campaigning. In the end Connolly had something to say – but it’s her campaign tactics that got people listening.

"abortion","First Thing: Trump talks of regime change in Iran and insists US ‘obliterated’ nuclear sites","Good morning. Donald Trump raised the prospect of regime change in Iran and defended his claim that its nuclear enrichment sites had been “totally obliterated” by US strikes over the weekend, insisting it was an “accurate term” even as a US damage assessment was still under way. The US president said in a social media post that the sites sustained “monumental damage”, adding: “The biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye!!!” Trump also highlighted the possibility of regime change in Tehran if the country’s leaders were unable to “make Iran great again”, going further than remarks by his senior officials. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said the mission “was not and has not been about regime change” but instead “a precision operation” targeting Iran’s nuclear programme. How effective was the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites? It remains unclear how much physical damage has been done. Iranian media reported on Monday that Israel had carried out a fresh strike on the underground Fordow nuclear site, with the Tasnim news agency quoting a spokesperson for the crisis management authority in Qom province, where the site is located. What are the longer-term effects on Iran’s nuclear programme? Again, unclear. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran insisted its nuclear programme would not be stopped. Here’s a visual guide to the attacks. Could the US become involved in a full-blown war with Iran? The vice-president, JD Vance, had said the US was “not at war with Iran, we’re at war with Iran’s nuclear programme”, while the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the US was “not looking for war in Iran”.

Republican representative’s ectopic pregnancy clashes with Florida abortion law A Florida Republican congresswoman is blaming fearmongering on the left for the reluctance of hospital staff to give her drugs to end an ectopic pregnancy that threatened her life. In May 2024, Kat Cammack was told that she was five weeks into an ectopic pregnancy, that there was no heartbeat and that her life was at risk. Doctors determined she needed a shot of methotrexate to help expel her pregnancy, but since Florida’s six-week abortion ban had just taken effect, medical staff were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did. Cammack looked up the state law on her phone to show staff and even attempted to contact the governor’s office. Doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication. What did Cammack say? The abortion opponent and co-chair of the House anti-abortion caucus told the Wall Street Journal she blamed messaging from abortion rights groups for delaying her treatment, which is not banned under Florida’s restrictive statutes.

"abortion","Kamala Harris stresses abortion rights and Black political power in sorority speech","On the fourth day, Kamala Harris spoke, again. Following Joe Biden’s Sunday withdrawal from the presidential race and endorsement of Harris as the Democratic nominee, she delivered what has become the core of her stump speech to more than 6,000 members of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Incorporated. Harris’s 15-minute address at the Black sorority’s biannual meeting in Indianapolis outlined what she described as some of the key accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration: eliminating some student loan debt – a mention met with resounding cheers – capping the cost of insulin, expanding lower-cost and no-cost healthcare to new mothers in 46 states, cutting child poverty in half and removing medical debt from the calculus behind credit scores. She spoke of unfinished work that she would take on as president, including making childcare and eldercare more affordable, securing universal paid maternity leave and signing into law a bill that would restore and protect the right to abortion, which was eliminated by the conservative-dominated supreme court in 2022. Harris also described her likely opponent’s plank as a set of grim, retrogressive ideas, which are detailed in the nearly 1,000-page policy treatise known as Project 2025. Donald Trump has denied any connection to the document, but several of its chief architects served in his first administration. What’s more, elements of the policy were included in the 2024 Republican party platform, as well as in speeches from this month’s Republican national convention. “I believe that we face the choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” Harris said on Wednesday. “And with your support, I am fighting for our nation’s future.” The women in the room, Harris said, were people who believe everyone should have affordable healthcare, where child poverty need not exist and where “the economy works for working people”. Harris detailed some of Project 2025’s aims, including eliminating the Department of Education, cutting Medicare and ending early childhood programs like Head Start. The document also calls for weakening the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a nationwide abortion ban, among other goals. “Let’s be clear: this represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future,” Harris said. “These extremists will take us back. But we aren’t going back. “Ours is a fight for the future and a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights. The freedom to vote. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate. The freedom to love who you love openly … the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and whole history, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body.” The statement, similar to remarks she made the previous day at her first presidential candidate speech in Milwaukee, elicited loud and sustained cheers. Harris also shared her memories of seeing Zetas – dressed in their characteristic white blazers and blue dresses – on Capitol Hill advocating for specific policies. Her speech seemed to say that much more would be needed from them now. Harris’s campaign set a fundraising record in its first days, but she will not be immune to the range of challenges that beset any presidential candidate. Harris will also face the challenge of skillfully combatting the racist and sexist statements employed by some of the opposition. Since Monday, elected Republicans have described Harris as “unintelligent” and “bottom of the barrel” and attempted to advance the idea that she is a “DEI candidate” and therefore underqualified. For some voters, these stereotypes can give false claims about Harris – a lawyer and the first woman of color elected to successive roles including district attorney of San Francisco, California attorney general, US senator and US vice-president – the imprimatur of truth. Harris decided to keep the commitment she made months ago to address the Zetas in Indianapolis, and a teachers’ union in Houston, on Wednesday, despite a congressional address from Benjamin Netanyahu that same day. That decision had, on Tuesday, prompted Brian Kilmeade, host of a Fox News morning program, to describe Harris as good at reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter but unwilling to sit for an interview and answer questions. In his estimation, she’d elected to skip the Israeli prime minister’s speech and flit off to “address a sorority, a colored sorority, like she can’t get out of that”. When she took the stage after Harris, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a Democratic representative from California, said: “Just yesterday, some crazy man … had the nerve to call us some colored sorority. Now, look, now, don’t wake the dragon!” Kilmeade has denied that he used the word “colored” and said that he used the word “college” instead. Either way, the statement would seem to reflect some level of disregard for the reason that Zeta Phi Beta (which boasts a membership of 130,000) and the eight other historically-Black sororities and fraternities, known as the Divine Nine, were formed in the early 20th century: to combat the racism and legal segregation that banned Black Americans from many universities, career networks and connections that can lead to an economically stable life. What the alleged statement also misses is the political strategy inherent in Harris’s decision to address the Zetas and other Divine Nine sororities earlier this summer: Black women rank among the Democratic party’s most reliable voters. Most Black men also support Democrats, but in recent election cycles Republicans, including Trump in 2020, have made significant gains. However, no Democrat can win the White House without an overwhelming share of Black votes. The Divine Nine, which also includes Harris’s sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, have already committed to amplifying its long-running voter-registration and education efforts to an “unprecedented” degree. And on Wednesday, a representative from the NAACP told the audience that the group will also mobilize 14.5 million Black American voters in 26 states. “There is so much at stake and again in this moment, our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve,” Harris said to the Zetas. “We know when we organize, mountains move. And when we vote, we make history.”","2024-07-24T22:02:55Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/24/kamala-harris-abortion"

The committee is chaired by James Uthmeier, DeSantis’s chief of staff who was previously the Republican’s campaign manager during his unsuccessful presidential primary run. In addition to targeting ballot initiatives, the committee will get involved in school board races, Politico reported, citing an individual who is familiar with the group’s plans. Florida Republicans have attempted to maximize their political control of local school boards, especially amid book bans and far-right education laws banning discussions of race and sexual identity being passed in the state, WUFT reported. A spokesperson for the governor told Politico that the goal of the political action committee is to support issues and candidates that are “committed to preserving Floridians’ freedom”. “From up and down ballot races to critical amendments, we’re steadfast in our mission to keep Florida free,” a DeSantis spokesperson, Taryn Fenske, said. Reproductive-rights activists have been pushing for voters to support an upcoming ballot initiative that would enshrine broader abortion access in Florida’s constitution, Axios reported. Since Florida’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in June, fewer abortions have been performed in the state. Activists have also seen more people seeking care in states on the east coast with broader abortion access. Amending Florida’s constitution is a difficult task – 60% of voters will have to approve the ballot initiative. But support for the abortion access measure, known as Amendment 4, has been picking up steam before the November vote. Supporters of the constitutional amendment have raised more than $12m in two months since the state’s supreme court approved the measure in April, the Tampa Bay Times reported. “Seeing increased financial support for the Yes on 4 effort provides us a glimmer of hope. Regardless of income or background, every Floridian deserves the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions without government interference, including abortion, and we’ll keep up the fight to make that a reality,” the campaign director for Yes on 4 Florida, Lauren Brenzel, said to the Times. Both amendments appear to be garnering widespread support. Recent polling by Fox News predicted that both amendments would overwhelmingly pass, with 69% of voters supporting the abortion-access initiative and 66% favoring the marijuana-legalization amendment.","2024-06-11T19:49:52Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/11/ron-desantis-freedom-fund-florida"
"abortion","Greens to ask Senate to vote to jettison anti-abortion bill in bid to split Coalition on issue","The Greens will seek to split the Coalition on the politically fraught issue of abortion by asking the Senate to vote to jettison an anti-abortion bill championed by two Coalition senators. The Greens senator Larissa Waters advised the Senate on Tuesday evening that she would move a motion on 26 November seeking to have the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill discharged. The move came after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, told Coalition MPs in a party room address two weeks ago that they should avoid public debate about abortion, controversy over which had likely cost the Liberal National party seats at the Queensland state election in October. The private senators’ bill is co-sponsored by the Queensland National Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal Alex Antic, and has been on the Senate notice paper for two years. It aims to force medical practitioners to save the life of a child born alive after a pregnancy termination. During the Queensland election campaign, the Katter’s Australian party state MP Robbie Katter caused controversy by announcing he would press the LNP to support similar legislation if it won the election. By seeking to have the Senate formally discharge the Canavan-Antic bill – citing Dutton’s wish that debate not be reopened ahead of a federal election – the Greens were pushing the pair and colleagues who supported them to either back their leader and abandon the bill, or defy him. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The government had avoided reopening public debate on the ever-sensitive issue as it too has differing views in its ranks on what is generally regarded in politics as a matter of conscience. To avoid exposing division on its own side, the government had opted to leave the bill where it lay. But with this move, the Greens stood to provoke both major parties. “Despite the two big parties wanting not to talk about a woman’s right to choose, a bill to control and reduce women’s choices remains on the Senate notice paper,” Waters told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “If the two big parties genuinely believe that abortion is not a federal issue then they should vote to discharge this bill from the notice paper, and the Greens will move for that early next week.” Without government agreement, a non-government bill cannot proceed to a vote. But a procedural motion about a bill is different. Acting on that distinction, the United Australia party senator Ralph Babet, who is staunchly opposed to abortion, used a motion in the Senate in August to draw attention to the dormant bill and force a debate on the issues it raised. His motion stated “the need for the Senate to recognise” that Australia’s health system was enabling inhumane deaths through abortion and that “babies born alive as a result of a failed abortion deserve care”. His motion went to a vote, with 15 Liberal and Nationals senators – including Canavan – plus the two from One Nation supporting it. With 32 against, it was defeated. The Country Liberal National frontbench senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price then dragged the issue into the federal arena a second time in October, when she gave comments on the issue to Nine newspapers, including calling full-term abortion “infanticide”. In his party-room address, Dutton gave an edict that no further comments were to be made because abortion was a state issue and “discipline” was required ahead of the election. Waters told Guardian Australia the Canavan-Antic bill was “a thinly veiled attack on women’s rights to choose to terminate a pregnancy”. “It’s another attempt to exert control over women, championed by a cabal of conservative dudes,” she said. “We should be talking about how to make abortions affordable and accessible.”","2024-11-19T06:55:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/greens-to-ask-senate-to-vote-on-anti-abortion-bill-in-bid-to-split-coalition-on-issue"
"abortion","Young, British and Anti-Abortion review – surely gen Z are too smart to devalue women’s lives like this?","Documentary-maker Poppy Jay’s new film has a title guaranteed to make my hackles rise, and perhaps the hackles of many others in a country that polls nearly 90% support for a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy: Young, British and Anti-Abortion. It’s an investigation into gen Z’s increasing presence among those who would seek to circumscribe or cancel that right. It looks at how they are looking to reposition the debate as a human rights issue rather than a religious one, and how they are emboldened by the overturning of Roe v Wade in the US two years ago. Jay meets a variety of young activists who hope that once again when the US sneezes, we will catch cold. Eden McCourt does most of her work for Abortion Resistance through TikTok. She says that though she is religious (a Google search reveals that she is a writer for the Catholic Herald), her views are secular and were formed largely through the experience of her parents refusing to terminate a pregnancy because the foetus had a severe, life-limiting genetic disorder. Instead her mother gave birth to her sister, Josephine, who died when she was four, but was “the happiest child I ever met”. Madeline Page is the director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students and tours universities, bolstering the troops and encouraging them to convert fellow youngsters so that they can move out into the wider world with their minds already correctly made up and on into positions of power. She, too, is religious, but says she was pro-life before she found her faith. James, 22, is the most traditional anti-abortionist. An evangelical Christian, he has volunteered with the Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK (an offshoot of the original organisation in the US) for the past three years and wants “the nation to believe [abortion] is an abomination”. Jay interviews them, and others, allowing them plenty of space to air their beliefs, time to persuade her or anyone watching who might be persuadable. Eden especially is personable and charming, and you wait with interest to hear the new generation’s views. “I don’t think equality for women looks like dead children,” she says. “The feminist movement has been hijacked by the idea that in order to be free and equal to men, women have to have the choice of abortion.” She acknowledges that social problems (poverty, abusive relationships, lack of support) are the root cause of many women’s unwanted pregnancies and the consequent desire to end them, but it is those problems that need to be solved, not the children who need to be punished. She does not have any practical solutions to these problems. Page, too, indirectly blames feminism. “For women to feel like in order to progress in their career, to have a home, be in a stable financial situation, they have to have an abortion – we are completely failing women.” This is badly worded (presumably even Page doesn’t think you actively require an abortion to move through modern life), but it’s a sign of the kind of thinking, somewhere between “magical” and “muddled”, that is going on beneath. Jay pushes her on what should happen in various scenarios. “I just guess in my utopia that wouldn’t happen,” Page laughs. Jay pushes again. “Do we force them to have a child they don’t want and won’t love?” No answer comes. The silence, as always when idealists, ideologues or any combination of the two are asked to think through their positions and answer for the consequences, is deafening. Because what answers are there, really, if you believe – like these three – that life begins at conception and that those two conjoined cells immediately trump everything about the woman carrying them; her mental and physical health, her happiness, her present, her future, her bodily integrity and autonomy, her relationships (including with the children she already has), her desire to live the life she wants and not have it derailed by a mistake, or a rape? It is good to make them think and to leave them floundering in a sea of possibilities that do not fit their world view (such as when Jay points out the large proportion of women who are already mothers who have abortions so as not to spread their resources too thinly). But it leaves this core devaluing of women’s lives intact. I remain unconvinced, judging by the small turnouts to rallies and the resistance from members of the public when the activists are out and about, that Jay has truly uncovered the beginnings of a new wave of danger for reproductive rights. I would like to think gen Z remains resistant to both religious and supposed secular arguments, that they can see through obvious nonsense, that they would strip the melodrama from a statement like “equality for women doesn’t look like dead children” and know that equality looks exactly like being able to control your life and your body, up to and including pregnancy – otherwise we have nothing. But I look at the state of women’s rights now and can think only how wrong, how complacent I have been before. • Young, British and Anti-Abortion aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.","2024-11-20T22:40:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/nov/20/young-british-and-anti-abortion-review-surely-gen-z-are-too-smart-to-devalue-womens-lives-like-this"
"abortion","RFK Jr and Democrats clash over his vaccine history in confirmation hearing","Robert F Kennedy Jr’s combative Senate confirmation hearing for health secretary erupted into fierce exchanges on Wednesday morning, as Democrats confronted one of the US’s most prominent vaccine skeptics, who will possibly be handed the reins of America’s public health system. The Senate finance committee ranking member, Ron Wyden, challenged the 71-year-old Kennedy over seemingly contradictory statements, reading quotes from podcasts in which Kennedy had claimed “no vaccine is safe and effective” while testifying under oath that he supports vaccines. He read another quote from 2020 how Kennedy claimed he regretted vaccinating his children. “All of these things cannot be true,” Wyden said. “So are you lying to Congress today when you say you are pro-vaccine, or did you lie on all those podcasts?” Kennedy disputed Wyden’s characterization, claiming his podcast comment was taken out of context. “[The host] asked me, ‘Are there vaccines that are safe and effective?’ And I said … there are no vaccines that are safe and effective for every person,” Kennedy responded. “I support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine. I will do nothing, as HHS secretary, to make it difficult or discourage people from taking it,” Kennedy said. The Colorado senator Michael Bennet accused Kennedy of “peddling half-truths” throughout his career, demanding yes or no answers about past controversial statements. When asked if he had called Lyme disease a “highly likely” military bioweapon, Kennedy said, “I probably did say that”, although he disputed other claims. Bennet said: “Out of 330 million Americans, we’re being asked to put somebody in this job who has spent 50 years of his life … peddling theories that create doubt about whether things we know are safe are unsafe.” Under tough questioning from the senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican and physician, Kennedy appeared to confuse Medicare and Medicaid, the government health programs for seniors and low-income people respectively. “Medicaid is not working for Americans and is not working for the target population,” said Kennedy. “Most people on Medicaid are not happy, the premiums are too high, the deductibles are too high, the networks are too narrow,” he said. Medicare, run by the federal government, has premiums and deductibles. Most Medicaid plans, run jointly by the state and federal governments, do not have premiums and deductibles, though it is true that networks can be narrow. Kennedy then said Medicaid could be reformed with “pilot programs” and perhaps telemedicine, artificial intelligence and direct primary care – a doctor’s office business model that operates like a subscription model. “Americans don’t, by and large, do not like the [Obamacare], they don’t like it, they don’t like Medicaid – and they like Medicare and they like private insurance,” said Kennedy. “They would prefer to be on private insurance. Most Americans, if they could afford it, would be on private insurance.” As health and human services secretary, Kennedy would oversee everything from vaccine policy to food safety, wielding enormous influence over public health decisions affecting millions of Americans. His controversial views – including debunked claims about vaccines and autism, fluoride safety and raw milk regulations – have put him at odds with mainstream medical consensus. Kennedy told NPR in December that as a member of the administration, he was “not going to take vaccines away from anybody”, but he also added he wanted people to make “informed choices”. In a letter to senators obtained by the Washington Post, Kennedy’s cousin Caroline branded him a “predator”, claiming he privately vaccinated his own children while publicly stoking vaccine hesitancy among worried parents. The accusation, from a former ambassador to Australia and Japan, lands as more than 15,000 medical professionals and 75 Nobel laureates have similarly mobilized against his confirmation. Kennedy’s pledge to “make America healthy again” through stricter regulation of food additives has found a number of allies, even as Republican senators demand clarity on his stance toward abortion rights and vaccine policy. The confirmation fight comes against a backdrop of shifting public attitudes: polling from Gallup over the summer showed nearly a third of Republicans now view vaccines as more dangerous than the diseases they prevent, a fivefold increase since 2001. Despite the opposition, Kennedy will probably survive the hearings. The final voteis scheduled for next week.","2025-01-29T22:44:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-hearing"
"abortion","This ‘natural’ infertility treatment is backed by Maha. Is it the right’s path to limiting IVF?","For Erica L and her husband, in-vitro fertilization was the “nuclear option”. After two years of trying to conceive, Erica and her husband had no idea why they could not have a baby. Doctors said only that they had “unexplained infertility”, a non-diagnosis of a diagnosis that is given to an estimated 15% of people trying to conceive. Erica was not ideologically opposed to trying IVF, but felt daunted by the price and unpredictability. Then Erica stumbled across a clinic that specialized in “restorative reproductive medicine”, or RRM. The clinic did bloodwork on Erica and her husband and urged them to eat well-balanced foods and take supplements, as well as prioritize exercise and sleep. Erica also started tracking her temperature and menstrual cycle in intense detail. “We wanted to do everything that we could to try to have a baby as naturally as possible,” said Erica, who asked that her full last name not be published. “There’s a lot of invasive things that I just wasn’t comfortable with.” Restorative reproductive medicine is a decades-old name for a constellation of therapies that are meant to revive the “natural” fertility of people trying to conceive. Often, RRM entails prescriptions for hormones, supplements and lifestyle changes - such as adopting a better diet - as well as closely analyzing one’s menstrual cycle. Its practitioners also sometimes use aggressive surgeries to root out endometriosis, a common and chronic condition that occurs when tissue that is similar to uterine tissue grows outside of the uterus. And, critically, RRM practitioners avoid the use of assisted reproductive technology such as IVF. Top Republicans, rightwing organizations and even White House officials have recently begun to rally behind RRM, seizing on its promise to enhance fertility without resorting to IVF. Many anti-abortion conservatives revile IVF because it can create unused embryos – a practice they see as unethical, if not murderous, as they believe life begins at conception. Yet IVF remains staggeringly popular, to the point that Donald Trump pledged to make it free in the wake of a 2024 Alabama supreme court decision that imperiled the procedure. Now, conservatives are trying to pare back that commitment – and some fertility doctors, including ones who offer RRM, worry that the right is co-opting RRM as a Trojan horse in order to sell a fertility agenda to voters while undermining IVF. Backed by several high-profile anti-abortion groups, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation to bolster government-funded research and education on RRM. In March, the Heritage Foundation – the influential thinktank behind the notorious Project 2025 – released a 63-page report that endorsed RRM and slammed IVF. Then, in July, the Department of Health and Human Services posted a notice soliciting applications for a $1.5m grant to fund an “infertility training center” that would expand access to resources for “holistic infertility treatments” rather than assisted reproductive technology. In August, the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration is backing away from the president’s campaign promises about IVF, although a White House spokesperson rebutted that claim. Dr Kaylen Silverberg is a reproductive endocrinologist who has advised administration officials, including Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, about IVF. During his discussions with officials, Silverberg said he was asked about RRM. “I’ve been doing this for 31 years, and I’d never even heard the term,” said Silverberg, who is also advisory board chair of the advocacy group Americans for IVF. “So I started doing research about it. I realized that restorative reproductive medicine is just a pseudonym for a basic infertility evaluation.” Silverberg’s view is shared by many mainstream fertility doctors and organizations, who say that the difference between their work and RRM is less scientific than ideological. In their view, RRM is a rebranded version of everyday fertility medicine, minus IVF. RRM, with its focus on optimizing the body’s “natural” rhythms, is tapping into a growing interest in holistic health and wellness – one that is being increasingly politicized and expertly leveraged by the “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha) movement. But support for RRM alone, Silverberg said, cannot fulfill Trump’s campaign promises. “The problem is going to be if – and this is a big if – anybody tries to limit expansion of fertility access and care and coverage to restorative reproductive medicine.” *** ‘There is another option’ RRM is not a monolith. Some of its leading organizations and adherents take no position on IVF and reject the idea that RRM is ideologically driven or a new name for old medicine. Instead, they are drawn to RRM’s stance that infertility is not itself a disease but a symptom of something else that has gone wrong. Established in 2000, the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine (IIRRM), the pre-eminent group championing RRM, maintains a registry of RRM clinicians and collects data about its techniques’ efficacy. Dr Monica Minjeur, who was trained in family medicine and serves as the US director of communications and development for the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said RRM is “not an anti-IVF movement”. As far as Minjeur knows, no one in Congress has approached the institute to discuss RRM. “We will never say: ‘IVF should go away.’ We just mostly want people to realize: ‘Hey, there is another option,’ because so many couples are told IVF is your only option,” said Minjeur, who added that she is a Democrat. Some RRM advocates and groups do oppose IVF and have long aligned themselves with conservative causes such as the anti-abortion movement. One of the most well-known RRM techniques is NaPro Technology, which usually involves such tactics as cervical mucus tracking and has been pioneered by the anti-abortion Saint Paul VI Institute since the 1980s, when the Vatican condemned IVF. The institute’s website presents NaPro Technology as an alternative to IVF, which it calls “a highly abortive technology that often forces women to make abortion-related decisions”. In June, a new thinktank, the Maha Institute, held a roundtable discussion about women’s health and fertility. In her introduction to the discussion, Maureen Ferguson, a commissioner for the US Commission on International Religious Freedom with longstanding ties to the anti-abortion movement, sang RRM’s praises. “Traditional women’s health and fertility care has relied heavily on big pharma Band-Aids and workarounds that circumvent a woman’s reproductive system,” Ferguson said. “Women of all political stripes appreciate healthcare that works in harmony with their body and restores health.” IIRRM wants to harness Maha advocates’ enthusiasm but is wary of being equated with the movement, according to Minjeur and Dr Tracey Parnell, the institute’s global director of communications and development. They described RRM and Maha as two sides of a Venn diagram. “We want to bring increased health to women and men and families,” Minjeur said of Maha. “Beyond that, there are definitely a fair amount of differences.” Parnell added: “We really truly are open to quite broad collaboration without being co-opted.” *** The rise of wellness culture The Make America Healthy Again movement is perhaps the best illustration of a broader push within American conservatism to incorporate the historically leftwing language of holistic health and “natural” treatments – in short, “wellness” – to advocate for traditionally rightwing aims, such as convincing women to have big families. This push started to gain steam in the years after the Covid pandemic, as trust in mainstream medicine started to falter: a survey of nearly half a million US adults found that trust in physicians and hospitals declined from roughly 72% to just 40% between April 2020 – the month after the pandemic broke out – and January 2024. As trust eroded, the wellness industry exploded. Between 2019 and 2023, it grew from $5.3tn to $6.32tn, according to the Global Wellness Institute, which defines wellness as the ongoing and individual pursuit of “optimal holistic health and wellbeing”. “Wellness” can encapsulate a wide range of activities, from undeniably healthy behaviors (such as exercising and eating nutritious foods) to practices that may be dangerous (such as drinking raw milk). These activities are yoked together by a deceptively simple ethos, according to Amy Larocca, author of the book How to Be Well: Navigating Our Self-Care Epidemic, One Dubious Cure at a Time. “In wellness, things that are natural are superior to things that are not,” Larocca explained. Wellness’s sales pitch can be particularly appealing to Americans, given the astronomical costs of traditional healthcare in the US. A single IVF cycle can run to tens of thousands of dollars and most states do not require insurers to cover it. By contrast, countries such as Denmark and Sweden cover vast swathes of fertility treatments, including IVF. RRM treatments tend to cost far less than IVF, and may soon get even cheaper. In June, Arkansas’s Republican-dominated state legislature became the first in the country to pass a law requiring state insurance to cover RRM therapies. But critics say there is little quality evidence that RRM is more effective at helping people have babies than mainstream fertility medicine. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons are worried that other states may follow Arkansas’s lead; last week, the medical organizations sent a letter to urging the National Governors Association to reject pro-RRM legislation. Women’s health and infertility are especially ripe breeding groups for wellness because mainstream medicine routinely fails to take either seriously. Between 2013 and 2023, just 8.8% of research funded by the National Institutes of Health focused on women’s health. Women are also more likely to have their medical concerns dismissed. When women and people of color show up at emergency rooms with signs of chest pain, they usually wait longer; women are also less likely to be admitted. *** ‘Many sobbing women’ A year after Erica started working with the restorative reproductive medicine clinic, the clinic told her: “We’re really concerned that you’re not pregnant yet. You should be pregnant.” The RRM specialists suggested that Erica might have endometriosis, which affects about one in 10 women and girls worldwide and is believed to be a leading cause of infertility. It is also profoundly understudied. In 2023, a mere 0.06% of the NIH’s $47bn budget was earmarked for endometriosis research. Because many doctors dismiss the symptoms of endometriosis or lack the expertise to recognize it, it generally takes between five and 11 years to get a diagnosis. Erica went ahead with a surgery to diagnose and remove endometriosis tissue. RRM practitioners have suggested that the condition can be treated by a “one-and-done surgery” – as one RRM surgeon put it in the Heritage Foundation report – that aggressively excises endometriosis tissue. A month later, Erica got pregnant. Erica estimated that she and her husband spent, in total, about $2,500 on RRM. “We definitely wouldn’t have our daughter without them,” she said of RRM specialists. Many of RRM’s prescriptions are common sense: if you are trying to get pregnant, it can be helpful to take a holistic view of your health and know as much about your menstrual cycle as possible. But mainstream reproductive endocrinologists are skeptical of RRM’s position that infertility itself is not a disease, which runs counter to the World Health Organization’s definition of infertility. They also suspect that RRM may over-rely on surgery to treat endometriosis. One recent review of infertility treatments published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that while surgery can help mild cases of endometriosis, doctors should use IVF when it is severe. When treated with IVF, almost 40% of women under 35 who have endometriosis get pregnant within a single cycle, the review found. “We do a lot of surgery and other treatment options that can optimize a woman’s fertility. But in the end, there are many diagnoses that cannot be solved with those elements alone and need a very effective tool like IVF,” said Dr Rachel Weinerman, a reproductive endocrinologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University’s school of medicine. “You need to have a whole toolbox available to decide what is the right tool for that specific patient.” Dr Eve Feinberg, a reproductive endocrinologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg school of medicine, first heard of RRM when she started treating patients who had tried it. If patients stick with RRM and defer the use of assisted reproductive technology for too long, Feinberg warned, some may become so old that they lose their chance to have biological children. “I’ve had many sobbing women in my office who really missed out on their fertility window by trying endless numbers of years of this method, who weren’t given the truth and weren’t given a chance to explore other methods because they were misled and they were told that this would work for them,” she said. “I counsel my patients that IVF has limitations. It doesn’t work for every patient. I didn’t feel like these women were adequately counseled in that way.” In an extensive memo it shared with the Guardian, IIRRM rejected many of the critiques of RRM as unfounded, including the idea that it over-relies on surgery. Physicians who provide IVF too often default to it, the institute contended, adding that it would welcome more research comparing RRM with conventional medicine. As someone who eats a mostly plant-based diet, runs religiously and avoids makeup, Feinberg considers herself to be more “natural” than most. She understands the appeal of the wellness-style language that surrounds RRM. “It’s being marketed as being holistic. It’s being marketed as being natural and ethical,” Feinberg said. But, she continued: “I think RRM plays into this fallacy that we can understand everything and we can fix everything. And it’s just not true.”","2025-08-23T12:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/aug/23/restorative-reproductive-medicine-ivf"
"abortion","How a rightwing machine stopped Arkansas’s ballot initiative to roll back one of the strictest abortion bans","Theresa Lee was 22 weeks pregnant last year when her doctor confirmed the news: she had no amniotic fluid and the baby she was expecting, who she had named Cielle, was not growing. In many states across the US, Lee would have been advised that terminating the doomed pregnancy was an option, and possibly the safest course to protect her own life. But in the state of Arkansas, Lee was told she had just one choice: wait it out. A doctor who had confirmed the diagnosis was apologetic but insistent: the state’s laws meant he could be fined or jailed if he performed an abortion. In the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade, Arkansas activated a so-called trigger law that made all abortion illegal except if a woman was in an acute medical emergency and facing death. There are no other exceptions: not for rape victims, minors or fatal fetal anomalies. For the next five weeks, on a weekly basis, doctors knew Lee – already a mother to one-year-old Camille at the time – was at risk because she had placenta previa, which could cause bleeding and death. But she returned regularly to her OB-GYN’s office to be scanned, waiting to hear if Cielle’s fetal heartbeat had stopped. “I was having to prepare for if I passed. Me and my husband had to have a lot of really tough conversations about all the outcomes, just to prepare in case I wasn’t going to be there for my husband and my daughter,” she said. Lee never seriously considered leaving the state to get an abortion because the cost seemed exorbitant, childcare would be an issue, and she was uncertain about whether she could face criminal charges once she came home. None of her doctors ever suggested it, either. “I would have had an abortion, 100%. I am very much a realist. I knew she was going to pass. Having to carry her week after week and knowing she was going to pass, it was a horrific waiting game,” she said. Once Cielle stopped moving, and no fetal heartbeat was detected, she traveled three hours to the UAMS hospital in Little Rock from her home in Fort Smith because doctors thought delivering at the larger hospital would be safer in case of complications. There, she was induced and delivered a stillbirth. Luckily, the labor proceeded without any incident. “When I came in they had blood ready just in case. I remember seeing it out of the corner of my eye,” Lee said. The delivery room seemed prepared especially for women like Lee. She saw signs on the wall that said her baby was in heaven. When she was told the cost of transferring Cielle’s remains back home would be more than $1,000, she opted to take her in her car by herself. She held the casket in her arms the whole way. A chance for change Voters in 10 states will cast ballots next week to expand their state’s abortion protections or maintain the status quo. Arkansans won’t be among them. But for seven weeks this summer, it looked like Arkansas voters would have an opportunity to change the state’s constitution to roll back one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. There are few places in the US where it is more dangerous to be a pregnant woman than in Arkansas. The state had the worst maternal mortality rate in the country, according to data collected by the CDC from 2018-2021. It showed that about 44 mothers die for every 100,000 live births. An Arkansas maternal mortality review board, which reviews such data, found that 95% of pregnancy-related deaths in that period were considered preventable. The Guardian’s reporting has not identified specific cases in which the state’s ban on abortion has led directly to a death, but abortion rights advocates believe the risks are high. In July, a dedicated network of about 800 grassroots organizers in Arkansas had collected the necessary signatures to get a measure on the 5 November ballot that – if passed – would have changed Arkansas’s constitution to protect the right to abortion for any reason up to 18 weeks of pregnancy. It also would have legalized exceptions for abortion after 18 weeks, including in cases involving rape, incest, fatal fetal anomalies, and life and health of the mother. It would have saved a woman like Lee from facing potentially fatal outcomes, and emotional and financial distress. The measure did not provide the same rights that existed under Roe – which protected abortion until viability, or around 24 weeks – a fact that organizers said kept national organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU from getting involved in the effort. But organizers believed that it was a measure that even conservative voters would support. After all, voters in neighboring Kansas, another Republican stronghold, overwhelmingly voted to protect abortion rights when its ballot was put to voters in a referendum in 2022. To the dismay and shock of the grassroots organizers, however, the Arkansas initiative was ultimately quashed before it ever reached voters. A paperwork error by organizers prompted a legal challenge by Arkansas’s secretary of state, John Thurston, who rejected the abortion amendment. On 22 August, the Arkansas supreme court upheld his decision. For Arkansas women, there is no end in sight. A Guardian investigation into the ballot’s demise tells a more complicated story than just a bureaucratic screw-up, revealing a confluence of rightwing actors working in parallel to ensure it never got to voters: a reclusive donor who has helped shape the anti-abortion movement across the US; the inner circle of the Arkansas governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who has proclaimed Arkansas “the most pro-life state in the country”; and judges who are supposed to be non-partisan but are deeply aligned with the state’s Republican party. “Everyone knew there was going to be a pretty organized and well-funded effort to keep it off the ballot, said Ashley Hudson, a rising Democratic star who represents west Little Rock in the Arkansas state legislature. “Is it collusion, directly? I don’t know. But I think there are a lot of people with aligned interests.” Changing the rules The atmosphere was euphoric on 5 July 2024 when grassroots organizers and activists marched into the domed capitol building in Little Rock armed with dozens of boxes of signed petitions. They had accomplished the seemingly impossible: collecting more than 100,000 signatures across 50 counties in Arkansas in support of getting the abortion rights measure on November’s ballot. For grassroots organizers like Kristin Stuart, the effort had been all consuming. Stuart had previously worked as an escort at Little Rock’s only surgical abortion clinic, helping patients get through the throng of protesters who were usually assembled outside. The clinic no longer performs abortions but is used as resource center for women looking for financial support or information about how to get abortion pills from out of state. She was motivated to try to change the state’s constitution because she believed the ban was deeply unjust. Stuart was particularly incensed by circumstances that are especially dire for poor women and children in Arkansas, like the fact that it remains the only state in the nation that has not expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage to give poor women health insurance for a year after they give birth. “There was a small group of us that worked it like it was a full time job,” she said. The campaign, led by Arkansans for Limited Government (AFLG), divided the state into 50 clusters. There were cluster leaders and county leaders. Volunteers were trained three times a week. For a signature to be valid, they needed a person’s name, address, birth date, the date they signed and city. They also had to make sure the signer was a registered voter. “We knew we had to be perfect. We knew we had to do everything correctly, because they would be looking for anything to disqualify it,” Stuart said. They sometimes faced harassment, including protesters who could be “loud and mean and scary” who tried to stop people from signing, Stuart said. There were moles in chat and message groups where hundreds of volunteers were communicating. Sometimes the locations where canvassers were planning to collect signatures would be published ahead of time by Arkansas Right to Life, the state’s leading anti-abortion group. Organizers had to adjust the ways they communicated to adapt. But what volunteers discovered, said Lauren Cowles, was that there were “blue dots” in even the reddest counties of the state. “We found people who were desperate to connect. There are a lot of people out there who believe women should have the right to choose,” Cowles said. Voters were also being educated. Many did not understand that the total ban did not include any exceptions, including for rape. “There were many months when I did not believe we could get enough signatures. The last few weeks before the deadline, we saw such a surge of urgency,” Stuart said. Hudson, the Democratic legislator, believes the Republican effort to stop the measure from succeeding began in 2023, when Republicans first proposed an amendment to the Arkansas constitution that would make it significantly more difficult to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Instead of calling for signatures to be collected from at least 15 counties, as is stated in the Arkansas constitution, Republicans wanted to increase the number to 50 counties. Voters rejected the proposal in a referendum. But the Republican legislature passed a law to that effect anyway. “That was done in anticipation of a ballot like this,” says Hudson. It was a difficult challenge but organizers got the signatures they needed. In a move that would later prove to be a fatal flaw, leaders hired paid canvassers in the final weeks of the campaign to help get the petitions over the line. The chicken tycoon Ronnie Cameron, a poultry billionaire from Arkansas, is one of the most important rightwing power players you’ve never heard of. While Republican megadonors like Harlan Crow, Charles Koch and Dick Uihlein have become well known as big conservative donors, Cameron, a conservative evangelical Christian, has shied away from the spotlight, even as he has donated tens of millions of dollars to anti-abortion causes nationwide. According to public records, Cameron was the largest single donor in the fight against the abortion amendment, giving about $465,000 to groups that fought the initiative. This included $250,000 to a group called Stronger Arkansas, which was formed to fight the petition as well as a separate ballot initiative that would have increased rights to medical marijuana. Stronger Arkansas was run by Chris Caldwell, a consultant who is Sanders’s closest political adviser and served as her campaign manager in 2022. Two other officials with close ties to Sanders served as vice-chair and treasurer of the group. Cameron, the chairman of the chicken company Mountaire Farms, also donated about $215,000 to Family Council Action Committee 2024, a group formed by Jerry Cox, the conservative head of the Arkansas Family Council, which is staunchly anti-abortion. The conservative advocacy group was accused in June 2024 of using intimidation tactics when it published a list of names of paid canvassers who were working on the abortion petition. The names were obtained after the Family Council obtained them via a freedom of information request. AFLG said in a statement at the time that the publication of canvassers’ names put its team at great risk for harassment, stalking and other dangers. “The Family Council’s tactics are ugly, transparently menacing, and unworthy of Arkansas. We won’t be intimidated,” it said. In a 2020 New Yorker report by the investigative journalist Jane Mayer, Cameron was described as a reclusive businessman who had donated $3m to organizations supporting Trump’s candidacy in 2016. The report found that Trump had weakened federal oversight of the poultry industry even as he accepted millions of dollars in donations from Cameron and other industry figures. Cameron, whose grandfather founded Mountaire, also served on Trump’s advisory board on the pandemic’s economic impact. Cameron and his wife, Nina, reportedly attend Fellowship Bible church, which the New Yorker called a hub of social conservatism that lists condemnation of homosexuality as a key belief. Cameron also founded the Jesus Fund, and is a funder of both that private group and another called the Jesus Fund Foundation. According to public records, the Jesus Fund has donated $159m over the last decade to the National Christian Foundation, a highly influential multibillion-dollar charity that is considered the largest single funder of the anti-abortion movement. According to Opensecrets, Cameron and his wife are considered the 28th largest contributors to outside spending groups in this election cycle. One of the biggest beneficiaries of the couple’s donations is the Arkansas Republican senator Tom Cotton, who has called for fetuses to be given constitutional rights. Cameron also donated $1m to the pro-Trump Super Pac Make America Great Again Inc in July. Nina Cameron was reached by the Guardian at her home but she declined to answer questions about her political activity. A spokesperson for Mountaire did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. A spokesperson for the Family Council did not respond to a request for comment. A staple and a photocopy Five days after grassroots activists celebrated their milestone on 5 July, reality hit. Thurston, Arkansas’s secretary of state, who had participated in the state’s March for Life, an anti-abortion rally on state grounds, and had won the endorsement of Arkansas Right to Life in 2022, challenged the legality of the petition. In a claim that would be hotly contested, Thurston said AFLG had not submitted the documents that were required to name the paid canvassers and confirm they had been properly trained. He rendered 14,143 signatures they had collected in the final stretch invalid, leaving the final count at 88,000. They were a few thousand short of the 90,704 they needed under Arkansas’s legal requirements. Thurston offered no “cure period” for organizers to fix the issue. Abortion was off the ballot. Thurston seemed to be quibbling over a staple and a photocopy: AFLG had already submitted the required paperwork related to training a week earlier, but it should have stapled a copy of it to the petition it submitted on the due date. Privately, some grassroots organizers seethed at what they saw as an unforgivable mistake by AFLG leaders following a grueling campaign. Others say that even if the paperwork had been perfect, Thurston would have found another issue to challenge. In legal briefs and statements, AFLG argued that the 2016 secretary of state had counted signatures for other ballot measures even after those organizers failed to submit some paperwork. Thurston’s personal views on abortion, they said, meant he was discriminating against them. They also claimed that they had been verbally assured by Thurston’s assistant director of elections, Josh Bridges, that their paperwork was in order. Sarah Huckabee Sanders seized on the decision. In a post on X, the governor posted a photograph of Thurston’s letter and wrote “the far left pro-abortion crowd in Arkansas showed they are both immoral and incompetent”. Then the matter went to court. The judges Judges in Arkansas are supposed to be non-partisan. But when Sanders announced in June 2023 that Cody Hiland, a former US attorney who served as the head of the Arkansas Republican party, would be appointed to the state’s supreme court following a vacancy, she boasted that her pick would give Arkansas a “conservative majority” for the first time. “I know it will have the same effect on our state as it has had on our country,” she said at the time, in a reference to the US supreme court. Hiland would become one of four justices to strike down the abortion amendment on 22 August. The majority decision, written by the justice Rhonda Wood – who counts Ron Cameron’s Mountaire as one of the largest individual donors to her election campaign and had months earlier been endorsed by Arkansas’s state Republican party – found that Thurston had “correctly refused” to count the signatures by paid canvassers because the organizers had failed to file the necessary training certificate. The August ruling faced strong criticism, including from an unlikely source: a Washington DC lawyer named Adam Unikowsky, a parter in the supreme court practice at Jenner &amp; Block, and former law clerk to the late conservative supreme court justice Antonin Scalia. “The Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision is wrong,” Unikowsky wrote in a lengthy post on his legal newsletter. The majority’s decision, Unikowsky wrote, said that the allegedly missing paperwork had to be stapled to the organizers petition. Except, he said, Arkansas law does not say that. The three dissenting judges made the point in their dissent, saying Thurston had “made up out of whole cloth” that such a requirement existed. The dissenting judges said the majority’s endorsement of Thurston’s rationale was inexplicable. When AFLG argued that it had relied on Thurston’s office’s alleged verbal assurance that their paperwork was in order, the court rejected the argument in their majority opinion saying his comments did not change the law. Unikowsky also argued that Arkansas law made it clear that AFLG should have been offered time to correct its mistake. “Taking a step back, I have to dwell on the injustice of it all. Arkansans are being disenfranchised,” he wrote. He also noted that conservative groups who had made similar errors in their own ballot initiatives had not faced pushback. Sanders celebrated the supreme court’s ruling. “Proud I helped build the first conservative supreme court majority in the history of Arkansas and today that court upheld the rule of law, and with it, the right to life,” she said. The governor has long made touting the state’s so-called “pro-life” stance a priority. In March 2023 she signed a bill to create a “monument to the unborn” near the Arkansas state capitol. Shortly after the judges’ made their decision, the Pike county Republican committee issued a flyer for a political event in October. It featured a picture of Wood, the justice, alongside Thurston. They were both scheduled to appear at the Republican event. Wood reportedly “panicked” over the flyer and had the Republicans remove her picture but still planned to attend. Organizers say they will probably try again in 2026. Sanders will also be up for re-election that year. ‘There is no way we can stay here’ Looking back, Danielle – an Arkansas resident – realized she had eloped and closed on a house in Little Rock in June 2022, in the same week that Roe fell. A native of Philadelphia, Danielle (who asked the Guardian not to use her last name) and her husband, a doctor, moved to Arkansas so that he could work in underserved communities. They tried to conceive for months before turning to IVF. Danielle quit her job and commuted back and forth to Texas to receive treatment – her options were limited in Arkansas – and ultimately got pregnant. She was 18 weeks pregnant when a routine scan revealed that there was no fluid around the fetus, which also had no kidneys and no stomach. The pregnancy was not viable, even though the fetus had a heartbeat. When she was told by her doctor in Arkansas that her only option after the Dobbs decision was carrying the pregnancy to term, she and her husband knew they needed to find another solution. Even her IVF doctor in Texas urgently advised her to terminate the pregnancy. If she ended up needing a C-section during labor, it would take a long time before she would be physically ready to try again, he said. “My husband and I scrambled and got the earliest appointment in the closest place we could, which was in Illinois,” Danielle says. It was a six-and-a-half-hour drive and a two-day medical procedure. They stayed in a hotel for two nights. Danielle knows she was relatively fortunate to have the means to leave the state, unlike many women in Arkansas who lack resources. She and her husband also understood her life was at risk, even though it was never made explicitly clear. Her local hospital had only offered “palliative care” for the fetus, which meant scans every two-three weeks to check on its fetal heartbeat – not the kind of care Danielle knew she would need to avoid the risk of becoming sick and septic. After terminating her pregnancy in April 2024 and returning to Arkansas, Danielle got involved in the grassroots effort to collect signatures for the abortion ballot initiative. She remembers how one protester called her a “murderer” for collecting signatures. The person doing the shouting was an anesthesiologist she recognized who had attended one of her husband’s lectures and worked at the UAMS hospital in Little Rock. She went to the statehouse when the signatures were turned in, full of hope. She was photographed by a friend that day holding a sign that read: “I deserved better.” “We felt so accomplished when we turned those in. I was so excited. I felt very triumphant. We did this in a state where it’s really hard to do,” she said. When the supreme court of Arkansas ruled against them, Danielle knew she would have to leave. Then she became pregnant again with the one IVF-created embryo she had left. “I said there is no way we can stay here and my husband agreed. It’s not a safe place for me to be,” she told the Guardian. “We cannot raise a daughter here.” There were things about life in Arkansas – like their nice home – that she loved. But now they are moving back to Philadelphia. “I think I was naive moving from a big city where I never would have thought twice about what I could do with my own body. It’s a shame. It’s so sad.” Theresa Lee, the woman who was forced to deliver a stillbirth, echoed Danielle’s disappointment. “You want to believe that we as citizens have a chance at voting for what we believe in, but with the precedent set by the supreme court in the state of Arkansas, it’s clear we don’t,” she said. “I do not desire to have another pregnancy in Arkansas. I don’t feel safe and I don’t feel cared for as a woman in our state. What happened to me can happen to any woman and it has. Arkansas is a dangerous place to be pregnant.”","2024-10-29T13:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/arkansas-abortion-ban-ballot"
"abortion","Abortion measures are on the ballot in 10 states this year. Democrats can win them","If you’re tired of breathlessly following the horserace polling of the presidential and congressional races, you might consider instead breathlessly following the horserace polling of ballot initiatives to protect reproductive rights. In a sense, they’re more revealing. Pending some outstanding court challenges from Republicans – whose dogged commitment to “leaving this issue to the states” curiously disappears when they realize they’re going to lose – up to 10 states will have abortion referendums on the ballot this year. And it happens that they’ll share that ballot with competitive Senate races in states like Montana, Nevada, Arizona, Florida and Maryland. In Nevada and Arizona, which could also play a decisive role in the presidential race, a Fox News poll found that over 70% of voters in both states plan to vote in favor of codifying abortion rights. Giving voters the opportunity to vote directly on abortion rights is a strategic win for progressives on a few levels. Of course, in a time when 22 state legislatures have acted to restrict abortion access since Dobbs, it’s a powerfully effective way to protect the right to choose. It also helps keep the subject in headlines when the Trump campaign would prefer voters to be distracted by mythical, racist claims about Haitian immigrants. And perhaps most significantly, it could motivate otherwise unenthusiastic voters to show up for what seems to be yet another excruciatingly close election. Ballot initiatives are a useful exercise in revealed preference. It has long been observed that millions of Americans end up voting against their economic self-interest each election cycle. In presidential elections, voters choose candidates, not policy papers. It’s why swing voters were not compelled by the argument that Joe Biden could serve four more years as president because he “surrounds himself with the right people”. Yet when voters have the chance to vote up or down on an issue that will directly impact their lives, they aren’t in the habit of denying themselves civil rights or quality of life improvements. And in the wake of Roe v Wade getting overturned, that has proved especially true. In 2022, every state referendum on abortion was a victory for pro-choice advocates. Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont voted to enshrine reproductive rights in their respective constitutions, while voters in Kentucky and Montana decisively voted down measures that would have restricted them. This coincided with progressive overperformance in gubernatorial and congressional races, where abortion proved highly salient. Ballot initiatives on other issues have also demonstrated sizable majorities for the right progressive priorities, even in so-called conservative states. Since 2012, measures to legalize recreational marijuana have passed in over a dozen states – including Alaska, Montana, Missouri and Ohio. Meanwhile, per Ballotpedia, there have been 22 statewide measures to raise the minimum wage since 1998; they’ve all passed. In this election, too, there are opportunities for waves of support for progress in unexpected places. Take Florida (please). The citizen-led group Floridians Protecting Freedom has been tirelessly pushing for amendment 4, which would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution if it can garner 60% of the vote. One poll found that the initiative is positioned nicely to pass, with 69% support. Meanwhile, Florida amendment 3, which would legalize marijuana in the state, has already broken the record for the most money spent on any state cannabis measure, with more than $100m raised and counting. On that issue, the Republican party seems to recognize which way the smoke is blowing, since Trump has come out in favor of it. For all the talk of Florida falling out of reach for progressives, these amendments could serve as yet another signal that the left shouldn’t give up on the state. This is the same state that voted to restore the voting rights of more than 1 million felons in 2018 (despite immediate efforts that followed by the Republican government to subvert the will of the people). There is such a sizable bloc for progress, in fact, that despite Florida’s 60% threshold for constitutional amendments being the highest in the country, Republicans have proposed raising it even higher, to 66.67%. Beyond the Sunshine state, putting abortion rights front and center could also help address the Harris campaign’s nationwide challenges with younger voters. While Kamala Harris has managed to earn back some of the support that Biden lost among voters under 30, she still isn’t matching his 2020 performance. Sure, maybe touting Taylor Swift’s endorsement on Instagram or sending Barack Obama to juice voter registration on TikTok will move the needle. But with women under 45 citing abortion as their most motivating issue this election, it would seem wise to keep spotlighting a rare issue that is both persuasive to swing voters and galvanizing for young activists. At the St Petersburg campus of the University of South Florida, the 20-year-old college senior Alexis Hobbs can be found wearing a pink T-shirt behind a pink table recruiting her peers to vote “Yes on 4.” In an interview with New York Magazine, Hobbs shared just how motivated her fellow young people are to fight this fight: “They don’t want to live out their entire adulthood this way.” Katrina vanden Heuvel is editorial director and publisher of the Nation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has contributed to the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times","2024-09-24T10:00:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/24/abortion-law-vote-swing-states-florida-arizona"
"abortion","Anti-abortion advocate Joanna Howe banned from South Australia’s upper house for alleged ‘threatening’ tactics towards politicians","The anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe has been banned from South Australia’s upper house after its president revealed in parliament that he had received several complaints from MLCs alleging she had used “insults and threatening and intimidating tactics” towards politicians during a debate about the state’s controversial “forced birth” legislation. The legislation, if passed, would have meant any South Australian seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days, would instead be induced, give birth, then either keep or adopt out the child. The proposed laws in SA, introduced by the Liberal MLC Ben Hood, were defeated by just one vote (10 to nine) on 16 October. Hood credited Howe as the “legal lead” on the legislation during his speech. SA’s Legislative Council president, Terry Stephens, told parliament on Thursday: “Of the complaints that have been provided, of the highest concern is the suggestion that the visitor was attempting to improperly influence the free performance by members of their duties,” adding that the complaints identified that visitor as Howe. Howe said on Wednesday she had put pressure on one MP to renege on a voting deal on the legislation during the dinner break of the debate on the bill. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Stephens told parliament he had received complaints about Howe’s behaviour both in the chamber and outside it, “including areas where visitors should not have access unless accompanied by a member or their staff”. “Members have claimed to witness insults and threatening and intimidating tactics employed by Dr Howe towards some members,” he said. “It is entirely unacceptable for visitors to roam the corridors and other areas adjacent to the chamber unaccompanied. It is even more unacceptable that any member should feel intimidated or threatened by visitors while carrying out their free performance as a member of the council.” Guides to parliamentary procedures cite “various examples of attempts of molestation, reflection or intimidation of members in carrying out their duties in the house which can be considered a contempt”, Stephens said. “[Members] must feel safe in carrying out their parliamentary duties and have confidence that they are free to do so without interference, intimidation or undue influence from visitors. In considering these accounts, I have decided that Dr Howe behaved in a manner that did not afford members that right and risked compromising the effective functioning of the chamber. “As such, I advise the council that Dr Howe will not be permitted to attend the public or president’s galleries of this chamber, nor be permitted to access the areas adjacent to the chamber, such as the corridors, as well as other shared areas in the Legislative Council.” On ABC Adelaide on Thursday, Howe said it was a “complete surprise and a shock … that MPs in the parliament could abuse their power and privilege in this way”. “Clearly there is a cabal of pro-abortion MPs in the parliament who want to silence me because they disagree with the … position I take on third trimester abortions,” she said. “I do not think that I did anything wrong. I refute every allegation that has been made, and I’ll be considering my options in terms of what I can do to challenge it. This decision to ban me from the SA parliament will age very, very badly for Terry Stephens and the cabal of pro-abortion MPs.” Anti-abortion activists have been focusing on later-stage abortions, which are rare and only done when there is significant risk to the woman or the foetus. Abortions after 27 weeks and six days are exceedingly rare. The Liberal MLC Michelle Lensink, who was against the bill, was absent on the night of the vote, having treatment for breast cancer. Her colleague Jing Lee, who would have voted for the bill, was going to be her pair, sitting the vote out to offset Lensink’s absence. Lee told parliament this week that after an “unexpected encounter with a very persistent visitor” she had withdrawn that pairing offer. That led to chaotic scenes as MPs scrambled to find a replacement pair – two other MLCs were canvassed before Hood agreed to absent himself, despite his firm support of the bill. Lee told parliament she had been “traumatised by the incident [and] suffered from a lack of sleep and [continued] to experience anxiety” but did not name Howe or anyone else as the person responsible. Howe said on Wednesday that she had run into Lee in the dinner break. Asked if she pressured Lee to pull out of the pairing deal, Howe said: “I did.” Howe told ABC Adelaide radio that she told Lee “if you pair out, some of those babies that could be saved if this bill passes, won’t be saved”, and that she would “hold [her] to account in the public square” using her social media presence. “And I speak to preselectors, because many Liberal party preselectors who vote on this follow me, and I know how pro-life that membership is, and I think it will affect your preselection,” Howe said she told Lee. Howe said the pair hugged and took a selfie, and that Lee sent her a text thanking her for the conversation. Stephens said that as well as Lee saying she felt “vulnerable” after an incident with “a very persistent visitor”, he had a number of accounts from multiple members about Howe’s behaviour. “It was claimed that Dr Howe was observed yelling at the honourable Dennis Hood to discourage him from vacating the chamber in order to provide a pair for the vote,” Stephens said. Guardian Australia has approached Howe for comment.","2024-10-31T08:19:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/anti-abortion-advocate-joanna-howe-banned-from-south-australias-upper-house-for-alleged-threatening-tactics-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Anti-abortion activists set up outside clinic ‘safe zones’ on first day of new law in England","Anti-abortion activists have been taking up positions just outside new buffer zones around reproductive health clinics on the first day of a law coming into effect. The safe access zones – which were initially approved by MPs in May last year – prohibit actions including the handing-out of anti-abortion leaflets within a 150-metre radius around centres in England and Wales. Pro-choice campaigners and providers also welcomed new Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidance issued on Thursday which specifically mentions “holding a vigil, or praying, including silent prayer” within the zones. These actions, along with holding bibles and displaying images of foetuses or babies, were cited as having a potential impact on people accessing abortion services. “The statute does not provide a defence to those seeking to influence/obstruct/cause harassment etc to people within safe access zones on religious or ethical ground,” the guidance stated. Under the Public Order Act 2023, it is an offence for someone within the buffer zone to do anything that intentionally or recklessly influences a person’s decision to use abortion services, obstructs them, or causes harassment, alarm or distress to someone using or working at the premises. While there is an expectation that a legal challenge could be mounted, campaigners including the Labour MP Stella Creasy welcomed what she described as “clear and unequivocal” briefing material issued this week to police. Kerry Abel, chair of the national pro-choice campaign Abortion Rights, said Thursday marked the beginning of a “changed landscape” and welcomed the mention of silent prayer, which she said had been used as a “cover” for intimidation. Legislation creating buffer zones around abortion clinics in Scotland came into force last month, while they have been in place in Northern Ireland since September 2023. However, while anti-abortion protesters were absent outside some centres where they have maintained a near daily presence, there was evidence that they will continue. The Guardian spoke to three people with rosary beads and a placard on a street near to an MSI Reproductive Choices centre in central London, including a man who said he had “stepped it out” to ensure they were outside a 150-metre radius. The CPS guidance to prosecutors also noted that a previous supreme court ruling in relation to Northern Ireland “acknowledged that there may arise factual questions of some delicacy” when it comes to some conduct. “Accordingly, a person who carries out any of these activities within a safe access zone will not necessarily commit a criminal offence. Prosecutors will need to consider not only all the facts and circumstances of the particular conduct but also the context in which the conduct takes place,” it added. Ailish McEntee, a safeguarding midwife for the abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices, broadly welcomed the new regulations. “This is really pushing back on the narrative that we are talking about something other than a medical procedure,” she said. “Having these safe access zones is going to take away the element of immediate harassment and the kind of intimidation tactics that patients and our staff have had to endure. Once we become more familiar with the zones, then we are confident that we can work with them and advise women who are coming to us.” Conservative and Democratic Unionist party MPs had claimed that the bill which created the buffer zones was leading “to the territory of thought crimes”. But they were defeated when they tabled an amendment designed to ensure that no offence is committed if a person is “engaged in consensual communication or in silent prayer” outside clinics or hospitals offering abortion services. A similar measure – public spaces protection orders (PSPOs) – has been in effect outside some clinics but these have been enacted by councils, rather than being national legislation.","2024-10-31T18:23:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/anti-abortion-activists-set-up-outside-clinic-safe-zones-on-first-day-of-new-law-in-england"
"abortion","‘We just have to keep fighting’: a shocking new film on the danger of US abortion laws","In August 2022, Amanda and Josh Zurawski were 18 weeks into a much-wanted pregnancy with their first child when her water broke early. The complication ended her chances of delivering a healthy baby and imperiled her health – but doctors in Austin, where the couple live, said they could not end her pregnancy under Texas law, because they could still detect fetal cardiac activity. In the wake of the supreme court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June 2022, which reversed half a century of precedent and overturned Roe v Wade, the Texas legislature, like those in 13 other states, passed a near-total abortion ban. Though the ban allowed for medical exceptions, doctors have said that the law – written by politicians, not medical professionals – is so vaguely worded, and the criminal penalties so severe (up to 99 years in prison for violating state abortion law), that it was unworkable in practice, blocking doctors from helping patients. So Zurawski, against her wishes and the common standard of care, remained pregnant, knowing her daughter stood no chance of survival, as she grew sicker and sicker. As she testified to the state in a lawsuit that bears her name – the first post-Roe v Wade to be filed by women who said that their health, lives or fertility had been endangered by abortion bans, and the subject of a new documentary executive produced by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and Jennifer Lawrence – she listened to the cardiac activity with a terrible mix of love, for the child she and Josh desperately wanted, and dread, for her deteriorating health. Doctors eventually performed an emergency induction abortion – but only after she developed sepsis and nearly died. The infection kept her in the ICU for days and cost her one of her fallopian tubes, permanently compromising her future ability to have children. Aided by the Center for Reproductive Rights, Zurawski sued the state of Texas, looking for clarity in the law as written, and responsibility for a policy that has led to a 13% increase in infant deaths, forced doctors to provide substandard care and inflicted incalculable trauma on women seeking basic healthcare. “Somebody had to file the first suit,” Zurawski says in the film named after her lawsuit, Zurawski v Texas, released just before a pivotal election in which reproductive rights across the country are on the line. “What we’re asking for in this lawsuit is the bare minimum human decency requires,” says Molly Duane, the Center’s leading attorney for the suit, in the film. “People are going to die. And the question is, does anyone in the state of Texas in a position of power actually care?” The film, directed by Texas-bred film-makers Abbie Perrault and Maisie Crow, captures with journalistic clarity the chaos, uncertainty and unnecessary pain and suffering that ensues when a state bans abortion – what happens in court, in hospitals, and in the private aftermath. It is one particular slice of post-Roe America – life-saving or simply dignifying healthcare denied, because of legal uncertainty, to women who wanted to be pregnant in the first place. “It’s like we’re in triage mode,” Crow told the Guardian. “If someone has to go septic before they can get an abortion, that means that for everyone else who needs abortion for all the reasons that women seek abortion care, they are not getting that care either. We really felt like we needed to highlight the most dire situation that was unfolding in front of us to emphasize the fact that if the women in this lawsuit aren’t getting care, then no one else is.” And the situation, as the film-makers found, was dire. As soon as Zurawski filed her suit, dozens of women, along with their partners and families, reached out with similarly harrowing stories. In a collage of voicemails played during the film, others share similar experiences: an ectopic pregnancy denied care until her fallopian tube ruptured, another inviable pregnancy carried to term. Share my story, tell people what is happening. “The state absolutely wants to sweep their experiences under the rug,” says Duane. “They just want to pretend like real people don’t exist at all.” Zurawski v Texas follows three of the eventual 22 plaintiffs, who provided in-person testimony on their abortion stories, something that was happening in court for the first time since the 1970s. Samantha Casiano, who lived in East Texas with her partner and their children, learned at her 20-week scan that her daughter, Halo, would be born without most of her brain – a defect called anencephaly that was incompatible with life. Unable to afford travel out of state for an abortion, she was forced to carry the pregnancy to term while planning for her daughter’s funeral, then watch as Halo gasped for air for four hours after birth. Dr Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN based in Dallas, also learned her long-awaited third child had anencephaly, and had to travel out of state for the medical care she used to be able to provide her patients in her home community. “Having these laws cripple our ability to provide care – it feels like a slap in the face,” she says. Zurawski, traumatized by her medical experience, resorts to surrogacy in another state. The film is part behind the scenes of their court hearing – nerves, fury, pride, inexpressible pain (Casiano, recounting Halo’s short life after birth, vomited on the stand) – and part documentation of trauma, healing and action. “We didn’t want to politicize it, because this is a healthcare issue that’s been politicized, but it should be a nonpartisan issue,” said Perrault. “We really just wanted to present what’s happening to people under these laws and let the audience take that in on a very human, intimate, personal level from each of these women.” For the participants – Zurawski, Dennard, Casiano, along with their partners and families – “the horror of what they had to experience and the impact of that on their families and their own reproductive journeys was evident throughout the film-making process,” said Crow. “But we also were just incredibly in awe of their bravery and their willingness to stand up for women across the country in filing this lawsuit and taking the stand to share their testimony.” The state, ultimately, did not listen to them. On 31 May, the Texas supreme court unanimously rejected the women’s legal challenge, declaring that the state abortion ban could stand as is, without clarifying when medically necessary abortions can be performed. The decision barely mentioned the women. “To know that people in the position of power feel that pregnant individuals should simply be vessels,” says Dennard in the film. “We just have to keep fighting, and we have to keep talking about it, and we have to keep telling our stories, without fear.” The film will be released directly for home viewing to do just that, as an explicitly urgent call to understand the stakes of abortion bans that many who do not experience them first hand do not understand. “Twenty-five million women in America live under bans like this,” said Perrault. “It’s not only these women, it’s also their partners and their children and their parents. Understanding that this issue could affect you in your lifetime is so key.” The landscape for reproductive rights captured in Zurawski v Texas is staggeringly bleak, even as similar lawsuits in other four other states with near-total abortion bans, including Idaho and Tennessee, remain in legal limbo. But Duane, along with Perrault and Crow, see power in what they witnessed with the lawsuit: people – such as Zurawski’s conservative family members – changing their minds and their votes through hearing the women’s experiences. “What we’re seeing now that we didn’t see pre-Dobbs is that families are talking about this,” said Crow. “It’s going to take a lot of time before abortion is accessible again. But in a pre-Dobbs era, abortion was not accessible to so many people who needed it to begin with. If there is a restructuring of how abortion becomes more accessible, I think that that’s something to be hopeful towards.” Zurawski v Texas is out now in New York and Los Angeles with more cities to follow","2024-10-27T08:23:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/27/zurawski-v-texas-abortion-documentary"
"abortion","Tate Modern to host Tracey Emin’s biggest ever exhibition next spring","Tracey Emin will open her biggest ever exhibition at the Tate Modern next spring, showcasing her best artworks from a 40-year career. A Second Life will include some of Emin’s most famous works, including the headline-grabbing and Turner prize-nominated My Bed, from 1998, alongside never-before-seen pieces. “I’m very excited about having a show at Tate Modern,” Emin said. “For me it’s one of the greatest international contemporary art museums in the world and it’s here in London. I feel this show … will be a benchmark for me. A moment in my life when I look back and go forward. A true celebration of living.” Emin, most famous for Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 (The Tent) and My Bed, has opened her own art school and embarked on a new body of work since she was diagnosed with aggressive bladder cancer five years ago. The exhibition will chart Emin’s work from her “first life” through to her second, post-illness and surgery. The confessional visual artist has spoken candidly about surviving cancer, the surgery she underwent and how she now has a stoma (an opening in her abdomen) and relies on a urostomy bag to collect her urine. “I am really happy that I didn’t die and I am around to see this exhibition,” Emin said earlier this year. “I was there at the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000 – and at the time it felt like the most exciting thing that could ever possibly happen to London. You judge a city by its art,” she added in celebration of the gallery’s 25th birthday. The survey exhibition will bring together more than 90 works including painting, video, textile, neon, sculpture and installation, demonstrating Emin’s “uncompromising confessional approach to sharing experiences of love, trauma and personal growth”. The Tate Modern said: “Emin’s commitment to unapologetic self-expression has transformed our understanding of what art can be and continues to influence contemporary art today, using the female body to explore passion, pain and healing. “Spanning her extraordinary 40-year practice – from seminal installations made in the 1990s, to recent paintings and bronzes going on display for the first time – A Second Life marks the most significant exhibition of Emin’s career, tracing the key life events that have shaped her journey and transformation.” The exhibition will begin by presenting works from Emin’s first solo exhibition at White Cube with a series of tiny photographs of her art school paintings from the 1980s which she destroyed following a difficult period of her life. It will include the documentary Why I Never Became a Dancer about her teenage years in Margate and other works centred around the seaside town where Emin now offers rent-free space to art students. The exhibition will also address Emin’s experiences of sexual assault and abortion. Shown publicly for the first time, the 2002 quilt The Last of the Gold is emblazoned with an “A to Z of abortion”, providing advice for women facing similar situations, the Tate Modern said. Two seminal installations – Exorcism of the Last Painting I Ever Made and My Bed – will also feature before the exhibition explores Emin’s experience of cancer, surgery and disability with the 2024 bronze sculpture Ascension and stills from a new documentary showing the stoma that she lives with. Emin, who was given a damehood in the king’s birthday honours list last year for her services to art, is one of Britain’s most acclaimed artists, a member of the Young British Artists movement of the 1980s, a Turner prize nominee, and a member of the Royal Academy of Arts.

"abortion","Hospitals and clinics are shutting down due to Trump’s healthcare cuts. Here’s where","Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since Donald Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated 10 million people to lose their health insurance. The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. But it will do so in part by paring back eligibility for Medicaid, the US government’s health insurance program for low-income people; raising the cost of healthcare under the Affordable Care Act; and defunding some family planning providers who offer abortions. Rural hospitals and obstetric wards will be disproportionately battered, since they are typically expensive to run and serve high numbers of Medicaid beneficiaries. More than 300 rural hospitals are at risk of closure or cutting services, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found. Almost 100 are located in counties that have no other source of obstetric care besides the hospital, according to a forthcoming analysis from the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy group. White, Native American and low-income women are especially likely to lose their sole source of care. “The one big, beautiful bill isn’t the only cause of the closures,” said Michael Shepherd, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who studies rural healthcare. “But it can be the death knell for hospitals that are already financially struggling – many of which would have survived for years to come without the changes.” A Guardian review found that healthcare provider groups in nine states have announced that the legislation contributed to their decision to shut down hospitals and clinics, end services or lay off employees. They include: Georgia In October, St Mary’s Sacred Heart hospital in rural Lavonia, Georgia, became one of the first hospitals to close its obstetric ward as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Mary’s Sacred Heart hospital has long struggled with a physician shortage and what a spokesperson called “changing demographics”, but “the Medicaid cuts solidified our decision”, the spokesperson said in an email. Patients were directed to seek care in a town nearly an hour away. Tammy Frye runs the Hart Life Pregnancy care center, an anti-abortion facility about 20 minutes away from St Mary’s. The center provides women with baby gear and information about motherhood, but does not offer medical care. Still, after the news of the closure broke, desperate moms-to-be started calling Frye and asking her for help finding a replacement doctor, Frye said. Many do not have access to reliable transportation. “They were all very nervous, very scared and upset because they were connected to their doctor,” Frye said. “What’s going to happen if these moms are in an emergency situation?” Kansas In October, Freeman Health System publicly backtracked on plans to open a hospital in a rural corner of south-eastern Kansas. A feasibility study found that the hospital was simply too difficult to open, given “the unpredictable impact of pending legislation such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and evolving challenges in rural healthcare”, according to a Freeman Health System press release. Maine Maine Family Planning, which maintains 18 clinics around Maine, has long provided both primary care and family planning services. Historically, it received about $2m in Medicaid reimbursements each year. But due to a provision in the spending legislation that blocks larger abortion providers from receiving those reimbursements for the next year, the organization was forced to stop offering primary care to patients in October. About 70% of Maine Family Planning patients exclusively rely on it for their healthcare. As a primary care nurse practitioner working in the deeply rural Aroostook county, Heather Curran said she treated patients who had gone without primary care for years. Now, after 10 years of working for Maine Family Planning, Curran’s job has been eliminated. She expects that many of her former patients will wait months to obtain appointments elsewhere, or simply go without. “I do this is because I want to improve healthcare in Aroostook county and because I love my patients,” she said. “A lot of these people are already barely getting by as it is.” Nebraska Community hospital, in Nebraska, is closing the only health clinic in a small town called Curtis due to financial difficulties and “anticipated federal budget cuts to Medicaid”. New Hampshire Two healthcare centers in rural New Hampshire closed in October, in part due to the changes in Medicaid and federal funding. “We’re really left with no choice,” the CEO of one of the centers told the Associated Press. The AP reported that the center, a branch of the Ammonoosuc Community Health Services located in a small town named Franconia, served “tiny communities around the White Mountains, whose patients typically are older and sicker than in other parts of the state”. New York The Medicaid cuts also prompted Kaleida Health to announce it will be shutting down a family planning clinic in Buffalo, New York, by the end of the year. It has already shut down two therapy clinics in upstate New York, also due to the cuts. Oregon Discussions over whether to close the inpatient obstetric and newborn care services at Providence Seaside hospital, off the coast of Oregon, were already under way by the time Trump signed the big, beautiful bill. But the legislation, a hospital spokesperson said in an email, contributed to a “historic reset” that has led the hospital to shutter its obstetric ward in October. Blue Mountain hospital, near the Idaho border, has also laid off 10 people in anticipation of losing revenue. Virginia Augusta medical group, a hospital in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, is closing three primary care clinics. Washington Seattle Children’s hospital, in Washington state, plans to lay off more than 150 staffers, or about 1.5% of its workforce. It will also eliminate another 350 open roles. Another hospital group in the Seattle area, Providence Swedish, also announced that it would cut almost 300 jobs across more than 100 departments by early 2026.","2025-11-21T22:01:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/20/hospitals-shutdown-trump-healthcare-cuts"
"abortion","Iowa supreme court allows six-week abortion ban to take effect","Iowa’s state supreme court on Friday told a lower court to let a strict abortion law take effect. The court’s 4-3 ruling held that the law – which bans most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy – does not violate citizens’ fundamental rights under the state constitution, rejecting a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood. The decision reversed a lower court order that blocked the 2023 law from going into effect. The law passed with exclusively Republican support in a one-day special session last July, making Friday’s ruling a win for the GOP in Iowa. Most women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks. Republican-led states across the country have limited abortion access since 2022, when the US supreme court overturned the federal abortion rights previously established by Roe v Wade. For now, 14 states have near-total bans on abortion, and four – now including Iowa – have implemented six-week bans. Representing Iowa during oral arguments in April, attorney Eric Wessan said that the state supreme court had already indicated what is appropriate in this case when the justices ruled that there’s no “fundamental right” to abortion in the state constitution. “This court has never before recognized a quasi-fundamental or a fundamental-ish right,” he said. But Planned Parenthood attorney Peter Im countered that there were core constitutional rights at stake that merit the court’s consideration of whether there is too heavy a burden on people seeking abortion access. “It is emphatically this court’s role and duty to say how the Iowa constitution protects individual rights, how it protects bodily autonomy, how it protects Iowans’ rights to exercise dominion over their own bodies,” he argued. Iowa’s law had previously been in effect for a few days before a district court judge halted it. The state’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, appealed, setting the stage for Friday’s ruling.

"abortion","Arizona supreme court delays enforcement of 1864 abortion ban","The Arizona supreme court on Monday granted a motion to stay the enforcement of an 1864 law that bans almost all abortions, a win for reproductive rights activists in the swing state. The state’s highest court agreed to the Arizona attorney general Kris Mayes’s request for a 90-day delay of the near-total ban, further pushing back enforcement of the 1864 legislation after a repeal of the ban was passed earlier this month. The stay will last until 12 August. A separate court case on the legislation which granted an additional 45-day stay means the law cannot be enforced until 26 September, Mayes said in a statement. “I am grateful that the Arizona supreme court has stayed enforcement of the 1864 law and granted our motion to stay the mandate in this case for another 90 days,” she said. Mayes added that her office is weighing the “best legal course of action”, including a petition to the US supreme court. The latest decision comes two weeks after the Democratic Arizona governor, Katie Hobbs, signed a law to repeal the ban. But the most recent repeal can only take place 90 days after the Arizona legislative session ends, possibly allowing for a small window when the ban could be enforced. Last year’s session ended on 31 July, NBC News reported. If lawmakers adhere to that timeline, the ban could be in effect for approximately a month, until late October. Hobbs has said that she will not prosecute any medical practitioners under the 1864 law. The Arizona supreme court rejected a motion from Planned Parenthood Arizona on Monday to hold off on enforcing the 1864 ban until the repeal takes effect. On the latest court ruling, the reproductive health organization vowed to continue fighting to “[ensure] all Arizonans can access the care they need in a safe, caring environment”, according to a statement. “We will not be intimidated or silenced by anti-abortion extremists, because our bodies and our autonomy are at stake.” In Arizona, abortion is currently banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The 1864 abortion law bans nearly all abortions, except to save a woman’s life. The US civil war-era law does not make exceptions for rape or incest. Residents of the swing state will probably vote on a referendum on abortion come November after a coalition of reproductive rights organizations collected enough signatures to get the issue on the 2024 ballot.","2024-05-14T14:20:47Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/14/arizona-abortion-ban-ruling-delay"
"abortion","Trump says he will vote against Florida abortion rights ballot amendment – as it happened","Donald Trump hit his favorite talking points in a rally held in Pennsylvania Friday afternoon, as he scolded the media, reiterated his call for death sentences for drug dealers, and spouted derogatory nicknames he’s assigned to opponents. The event was one of two on his schedule this afternoon as the former president heads back to Washington DC to speak at the national summit of Moms for Liberty, a conservative organization pushing for the removal of LGBTQ+ mentions and structural racism from schools. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is looking to keep her momentum with voters going, after yesterday conducting the first interview of her presidential bid with CNN, alongside her running mate Tim Walz. Her campaign has announced plans for an abortion-focused bus tour that will crisscross swing states, while Georgia is reportedly seeing a surge in registrations by new voters, particularly among the groups most likely to vote for Democrats. Here’s what else happened today: Kamala Harris’s campaign has responded to Donald Trump’s statement yesterday that he would support requiring the government or private insurances to back IVF care by saying he ‘lies as much if not more than he breathes’. Trump addressed the recent altercation at Arlington cemetery, claiming he only posed for pictures because families asked him to. Arlington officials said in a statement that members of his campaign staff were reported for their behavior during a “crass” photo opportunity for the Republican candidate. After receiving backlash for breaking with his base this week after he criticized Florida’s six-week abortion ban, Trump clarified he will vote against an amendment that would strike it down. Thanks for tuning in! Have a good night. The Defend Democracy Project, an organization formed to combat misinformation about the results of the 2020 election, condemned the Trump’s attempt to move his election interference case from Manhattan to federal court on Friday. After being convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in relation to hush-money he paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2020 election, Trump was scheduled to be sentenced next month in state court. Trump’s lawyers have been pushing to delay sentencing until after the November election. “Trump already tried to move this case to federal court under the exact same statute in 2023 and was denied. This time, he is trying to use the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity to bolster his argument,” Ambassador Norman Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee majority during the first impeachment and trial of President Trump and Michael Podhorzer, the chair of the Defend Democracy Project said in a joint statement issued Friday. “Trump knows this argument is a dead-end on the merits, but he’s clearly hoping to quickly force this up the ladder to the complicit MAGA justices on the Supreme Court to once again save him from facing accountability for his repeated attempts to interfere in our elections.” A man was tackled to the ground by officers at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally today, after he tried to climb over a fence and into the press area and then onto another piece of infrastructure at the event. Additional security has been added since the assassination attempt last month. Videos taken by reporters of the altercation and posted online show several officers pulling the man down before pushing him to the ground, handcuffing him, and leading him out of the event, as Trump talks about the shooting incident in the background. Donald Trump has defended himself from accusations that he rambles nonsensically at his rallies by claiming that he is in fact weaving together complex thoughts. “You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about like nine different things, that they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like friends of mine that are like English professors, they say” ‘It’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen’,” he told a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. “But the fake news, you know what they say: ‘He rambled’. It’s not rambling.” In her first solo campaign event, Gwen Walz, the wife of vice presidential candidate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, said she didn’t “take kindly” to remarks from JD Vance about family planning. Vance has recently said childless citizens have less of a stake in the future of the US, but Walz responded to resurfaced remarks he made back in 2021 about childless teachers: JD Vance said he was ‘really disturbed’ by teachers who don’t have biological children. For a long time, Tim and I were teachers who struggled with infertility. We were only able to start a family because of fertility treatments. We do not take kindly to folks like JD Vance telling us when or how to start our families. So let me use my teacher voice. Mr. Vance, how about you mind your own business?” On Friday, in comments to Fox News, Trump also clarified his position on a Florida amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution and overturn the six-week abortion ban, saying he would vote against it. The Republican candidate had previously told NBC News that the six-week window is “too short”, sparking confusion about his stance. “I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks,” Trump said Friday, but added: “At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month … So I’ll be voting no for that reason.” The amendment would ensure access to abortion care before fetal viability around the 24th week, and add exceptions when the mother’s health is in danger. Trump addressed the recent controversy at Arlington cemetery, when members of his campaign staff were reported for their behavior during a “crass” photo opportunity for the Republican candidate. Trump was there participating in a wreath-laying ceremony for 13 US service personnel killed in a 2021 suicide bomb attack in Afghanistan, and he told supporters at his rally that he was asked by families there to take photos. Blaming Biden and Harris (whose name mispronounces frequently) for the deaths of these soldiers, Trump said it was a “beautiful ceremony”: “After the ceremony they said, could you come to the graves?” he said, insisting he didn’t want any publicity. “I am the only guy who would hire a public relations agency to get less publicity,” he said, but added he wanted to do so for these families. “I am so happy they took pictures of me and them and the tombstone and their lovely son or daughter – there was a daughter too, an incredible daughter, frankly.” But as Richard Luscombe reported: In a statement, Arlington acknowledged one of its representatives became involved in the altercation with two Trump staffers, telling them that only cemetery representatives were allowed to take video and photographs in section 60, an area where recent US casualties, mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, are buried. “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,” the statement said, adding that “a report was filed” over the incident. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants,” the statement said. The staffers “verbally abused and pushed the official aside” as the person attempted to prevent them from accompanying Trump into the section, according to NPR, which first published the allegation on Tuesday night. Here are some of the latest pictures from the Trump rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania: Trump has already hit many of his favorite talking points in this speech, opening by scolding journalists present at the event, using derogatory nicknames for his opponents, and talking about his patriotism. He claimed he would push for prison time for anyone who burns an American flag, even though the action is protected by the constitution, and that he agrees with death sentences for drug dealers. He also repeated claims about immigration. From the Guardian’s Chris McGreal: Donald Trump has attacked foreign governments for allegedly emptying their prisons and shipping criminals to the US illegally. But then said that if he was in charge of the same countries he would be more effective at the same thing. ‘If I was running one of those countries, I’d be doing better than them at getting them out,’ he told a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Trump was hitting a favoured theme even though he has yet to produce evidence for his claim. But he did make reference to the release of video of Venezuelan gangs operating in Aurora, Colorado including shootouts. Trump has previously alleged that the Venezuelan government is one of those sending known criminals across the Mexican border. Donald Trump’s supporters have gathered and are waiting for him to speak in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The former president is expected to take the stage at about 4.45pm ET, before heading to a national summit in Washington of Moms for Liberty, a conservative organization pushing for the removal of LGBTQ+ mentions and structural racism from schools. Kamala Harris’s campaign has responded to Donald Trump’s statement yesterday that he would support requiring the government or private insurances to back IVF care: It’s worth noting that Democrats in the Senate have proposed legislation that would protect access to IVF, in response to the Alabama supreme court’s decision earlier this year that essentially banned the care in the state. However, Republican lawmakers have stopped that bill from passing: If you’re wondering why you haven’t heard much about Joe Biden these past few days … It’s because the president has been on vacation ever since giving the keynote speech on the first night of last week’s Democratic convention. Photographers saw him on Rehoboth Beach, Delaware on Wednesday: Here’s a look back at his speech to the Democratic convention, where he made good on his pledge to pass the torch to Kamala Harris: The Harris campaign clearly wants to keep reproductive rights at the top of voters’ minds in the weeks that remain before the 5 November election. Here’s Gwen Walz, the wife of vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz, in Virginia: Yesterday, Donald Trump said he would support requiring the government or private insurances to pay for IVF care. Patrick T Brown, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who opposes abortion, called Donald Trump’s statement of support for a Florida ballot measure that would expand abortion access “another middle finger towards pro-lifers.” Though Trump played a major role in overturning Roe v Wade by appointing three of the conservative justices who approved the ruling, Brown’s piece underscore how uneasy his relationship is with advocates for limiting abortion. Here’s more, from Brown’s Substack: Florida is faced with a ballot amendment that would wipe nearly all restrictions on abortion off the books this fall. It needs 60% of votes to pass, so pro-lifers had been modestly hopefully they could keep the “yes” vote under the threshold. But their cause will not be helped by Trump suggesting that he is “going to be voting that we need more than six weeks” (though his campaign later “clarified” that he “has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative.”) This, of course, comes after Trump has repeatedly stressed how “everyone” should be happy that the Dobbs returns abortion regulation to the states. Apparently his version of federalism only goes one direction, as his sandbagging of the efforts of Gov. Ron DeSantis and other pro-life Florida Republicans could push the “yes” side over the finish line in November - a catastrophe for the pro-life cause in the Sunshine State and nationwide. But wait - there’s more. At a rally that night, he outlined a proposal for covering IVF either through an Obamacare insurance mandate or paying for it with public money. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the cost per successful IVF outcome ranges somewhere around $61,000, and over 90,000 babies were born via IVF in 2022 (2.5% of all births nationwide.) That’s a static estimate of $50 billion over a ten-year budget window, putting aside what universally available free IVF would do to increase demand. For those who remember the contraceptive mandate fight of 2012, this would be that — on steroids. Kamala Harris’s response to a question during her CNN interview last night about her views on Israel’s invasion of Gaza was not well received by the Uncommitted movement, which has called for the Democratic party to stop supporting the incursion. “Israel has a right to defend itself – we would,” Harris said, while adding, “How it does so matters,” and “Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.” She reiterated her support for the Biden administration’s long-running efforts to secure a ceasefire in the enclave, saying, “We have got to get a deal done. This war must end.” In response, the Uncommitted National Movement’s co-founders, Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, said: The Vice President’s statement was morally indefensible and politically shortsighted as the lack of American consequences for Netanyahu’s horrific assault on Palestinian civilians in Gaza has emboldened Israel to now invade the West Bank. Vice President Harris must turn the page from one of the most glaring foreign policy failures of our time by aligning with the American majority that opposes sending weapons to Israel’s assault on Gaza. The controversy over the Trump campaign’s visit to Arlington does not appear to be going away – and some Democrats are weighing in on what they see as the latest example of the former president’s lack of respect for fallen soldiers and active servicemen and women. New Jersey congresswoman and former Navy pilot Mikie Sherill wrote on X earlier this week: “Arlington National Cemetery isn’t a place for campaign photo-ops. It’s a sacred resting place for American patriots. “But for Donald Trump, disrespecting military veterans is just par for the course. It’s an absolute disgrace.” And the Hill reports Virginia congressman Gerry Connolly and Maine representative Jared Golden – a former Marine – also criticized Trump’s use of the military cemetery for campaign purposes. Connolly said it was “sad but all too expected that Donald Trump would desecrate this hallowed ground and put campaign politics ahead of honoring our heroes”. Golden reportedly said “all visitors should take the time to learn the rules of decorum that ensure the proper respect is given to the fallen and their families”. In her interview with CNN, Kamala Harris made herself out to be a centrist leader who was not interested in discussing how her election would break longstanding racial and gender barriers in US politics, the Guardian’s Gabrielle Canon reports: In a primetime spot on CNN Thursday evening, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz sat for their first interview together as the Democratic ticket, taking questions from the anchor Dana Bash on a range of important issues, including their plans for day one if they win the race, the approach to the war in Gaza, and how Joe Biden passed the baton. With just over two months until voters will head to the polls on 5 November – and even less time before some will mail in their ballots – the Democratic candidates for president and vice-president made good on a promise to speak more candidly about how they will tackle the US’s most pressing problems. But this interview was about more than just policies and priorities. For weeks, Republicans and members of the media have called for the nominees to open themselves up to questions, especially the vice-president, who has for the most part sidestepped unscripted moments in the six weeks since the president ended his bid for re-election and endorsed her. Analysts and opponents were watching Thursday’s interview closely for new insights into how a Harris administration would approach the presidency, how the candidates interact with one another, and how she would respond in more candid moments. Here’s what we learned: Kamala Harris finally sat down for an interview yesterday, alongside her running mate Tim Walz. The encounter with CNN quelled weeks of growing pressure for her to interact with the press, though expect it to amp back up again if she doesn’t keep the outreach going. Here’s more on what the vice-president had to say, from the Guardian’s Robert Tait: Democrats lauded it as the perfect pitch; Donald Trump dismissed it as “boring”, while fellow Republicans invoked derogatory terms like “gobbledygook”. Between the two extremes, Kamala Harris appeared to have achieved what she wanted from Thursday’s groundbreaking CNN interview, given along with her running mate, Tim Walz – her first since become the Democratic presidential nominee. Under fierce scrutiny after nearly six weeks of interview radio silence, the vice-president earned lavish praise from the Democratic base while denying Republicans a clear line of attack simply by avoiding major missteps of the type that undid Joe Biden’s candidacy in June’s climactic debate. The performance is also unlikely to shake up a race that has reversed itself since Harris entered it and replaced Biden, flipping a narrow but solid Trump lead into a contest in which she is now firmly ahead. A commentator with AZCentral.com – a news site in the key swing state of Arizona – called the performance “too sane to be great TV”, an implicit comparison with Trump’s frequently ostentatious media appearances. Commenting on her championing of Biden’s record in office, the New York Times noted that “it turns out, Ms Harris is a better salesperson for Mr Biden’s accomplishments and defender of his record than he ever was”. But the highest praise came from Harris’s party supporters. “This interview with Dana Bash is a moment to recognize that it is absolutely under-appreciated that Vice President Harris is running a perfect campaign,” Bill Burton, a former deputy press secretary in Barack Obama’s presidency, posted on X. For Donald Trump’s niece, his political ascension has been so devastating that it pushed her to seek ketamine treatment, the Guardian’s Martin Pengelly reports: In a new memoir, Mary L Trump, niece of Donald Trump, writes of being pushed to despair, and ketamine therapy, by her uncle’s victory in the 2016 presidential election, his chaotic, far-right administration and his refusal to leave national politics despite his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020. “I’m here because five years ago, I lost control of my life,” Mary Trump writes, describing ketamine treatment undertaken in December 2021. “I’m here because the world has fallen away and I don’t know how to find my way back. “I’m here because Donald Trump is my uncle.” Her doctor, she says, answered: “I’m sorry. That must be very difficult for you.” Now 59, Mary Trump is a trained psychologist and bestselling author. Her new book, Who Could Ever Love You: A Family Memoir, will be published in the US on 10 September. The Guardian obtained a copy. Kamala Harris is looking to keep her momentum with voters going, after yesterday conducting the first interview of her presidential bid with CNN, alongside her running mate Tim Walz. Her campaign has announced plans for an abortion-focused bus tour that will crisscross swing states, while Georgia is reportedly seeing a surge in registrations by new voters, particularly among the groups most likely to vote for Democrats. Speaking of abortion, Donald Trump yesterday said he supported a ballot initiative to overturn Florida’s six-week ban on the procedure, but both his campaign and running mate JD Vance are trying to walk back the comment, underscoring the perils of the GOP’s position on the issue. Here’s what else has happened today so far: Trump also broke with years of Republican orthodoxy by saying he wouldn’t move to block abortion access in Washington DC, and told supporters he wanted the government or private insurance to pay for IVF care. Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, apologized after his campaign used images of Trump’s visit to Arlington national cemetery this week – which the former president has refused to do. House Republicans will travel to southern California for a judiciary committee hearing that will likely be aimed at Harris and her stance on undocumented migration. House Republicans, who have spent much of their nearly two years in control of Congress’s lower chamber investigating the Biden administration with mixed results, will next week hold a judiciary committee hearing on the effects of undocumented migrants in California. That is, of course, Kamala Harris’s home state, which she represented in the Senate from 2017 to 2021. The hearing, titled “The Biden-Harris Border Crisis: California Perspectives” will take place next Friday in Santee, California, a San Diego suburb in a Republican-leaning House district. Donald Trump and his allies have campaigned on cracking down on undocumented migrants, and have accused Harris of changing her answers over whether or not she supports building a wall along the border with Mexico. The vice-president’s stated policy on the matter is a little more complicated than they make it out to be: NBC News asked Donald Trump about his campaign’s decision to use images of his visit to Arlington national cemetery in communications to supporters, including on TikTok. He downplayed the controversial decision, saying, essentially, that they were just pictures and that he did not know “what the rules and regulations are”: Meanwhile, outrage continues over Donald Trump’s visit to Arlington national cemetery on Monday, during which one of his staffers pushed aside a cemetery employee who tried to prevent them from shooting pictures and video in an area where doing so was prohibited. While the former president’s campaign has forcefully rejected criticism of their conduct, their indignation was not shared by Utah governor Spencer Cox, who joined Trump during the visit. In a post on X, he apologized for using images of the cemetery, where American war dead are buried, in a campaign email: In an interview with CNN today, Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance was asked about the former president’s stated opposition to Florida’s six-week abortion ban. The Ohio senator also tried to clean Trump’s remarks up: The president is simply saying he doesn’t like six weeks. He obviously has said he doesn’t like late-term abortion, and I think he will make an announcement on what he actually wants to do on the Florida law in particular. But again, President Trump has been extremely consistent that he’s going to make this decision as a citizen of Florida. In further evidence that Donald Trump isn’t quite sure how to balance his party’s longstanding opposition to abortion with concerns that many voters favor continued access to the procedure, the former president yesterday spoke out against Florida’s abortion ban, leaving his campaign to clean up his comments. Florida, where Trump lives, bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and voters in November will decide whether to pass a measure guaranteeing a right to the procedure until fetal viability, which is usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. NBC News yesterday asked Trump how he’d vote on the measure. He replied: I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks. That didn’t sit well with his campaign, who quickly moved to walk back the former president’s comments, the Associated Press reports: Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement after the rally Thursday that Trump “has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida” known as Amendment 4 and that he “simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short.” His comments nonetheless drew immediate reaction from those who oppose abortion rights, including Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who said she had spoken with Trump after his speech. “He has not committed to how he will vote on Amendment 4. President Trump has consistently opposed abortions after five months of pregnancy. Amendment 4 would allow abortion past this point. Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position,” she said, adding that, “anyone who believes in drawing a different line” still “must vote against Amendment 4, unless they don’t want a line at all.” Kamala Harris spent the last two days in Georgia on a bus tour (her campaign seems to like bus tours) that culminated with a rally in Savannah yesterday evening. From the Guardian’s Justin Glawe, here’s what the vice-president told supporters, as she hopes for a repeat of the luck Joe Biden had in the state four years ago: After two days on a bus tour through south-east Georgia with her running mate, Tim Walz, Kamala Harris arrived at an arena in Savannah to a boisterous crowd and told them that despite the state being a stretch, it is still winnable in November. “Don’t pay attention to polls – we are underdogs,” the vice-president said, telling the roughly 9,500 attendees that they had “work to do” in order to secure victory. “We don’t mind hard work. Hard work is for workers.” Thousands waited outside for hours as a spitting rain became a steady drizzle, which turned into an outright downpour, on a hot and characteristically humid Savannah afternoon. Inside, thousands of supporters filled out an arena usually reserved for minor league hockey games and concerts – taking up every last seat. “It’s good to be back in Savannah,” she said, jumping right into a stump speech that, while familiar, nonetheless kept the crowd’s attention for the entirety of her remarks. Recent polling has Harris and Donald Trump nearly tied in Georgia, an indication of how close the race is likely to be in the state that Joe Biden won in 2020 by just 11,779 votes. During her brief remarks that lasted just under 20 minutes, Harris contrasted her campaign with that of Trump, who she criticized with her regular campaign line of moving the country backward, not forward. She touted policy plans such as affordable childcare and healthcare, paid family leave, expanding Medicaid and other aspects of what she called “an opportunity economy” focused on “building inter-generational wealth”. There’s been a sharp increase in people registering to vote in Georgia in the weeks since Kamala Harris launched her campaign, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports, with groups that tend to back Democrats making up a large part of the new registrants. It could be a good sign for the vice-president’s campaign in a state where Democrats reversed years of election losses in 2020, when Joe Biden won its electoral votes and the party’s candidates captured both of its Senate seats. Here’s more from the Journal-Constitution on the registration trends: Black women led the surge, with a 75% jump in registrations compared with the same 3 1/2 week period in 2020, according to the most recent voter registration data available from the Georgia secretary of state’s office, stretching from July 21 to Aug. 13. Sign-ups by Hispanic voters grew by an even larger percentage, 114% over the 2020 period, though the raw number of new registrations was lower than other racial groups because there are fewer Hispanic voters overall in the state. And new voters under 30 years old spiked by 76%. Overall, 50% more voters have registered since July 21 than in the same period four years ago. “It’s shocking. I did not expect to see something of this scope,” said Tom Bonier, a Democratic strategist and CEO of the data company TARA Group. “This has the potential to be a game changer in terms of the presidential race.” Bonier’s research also found similar leaps in 13 other states since Harris joined the race, and he said Georgia’s growth in registrations reinforces an emerging national trend. More than 46,000 people have registered since July 21, bringing Georgia’s total number of voters to 8.1 million. So far this year, 226,000 new voters have registered. Kamala Harris’s climb in recent polls has been driven by a surge in enthusiasm among Democratic voters, and the traditional bounce in support seen after party conventions, the Guardian’s Robert Tait reports: Kamala Harris’s entry into the presidential race has given a shot in the arm to Democratic voters, who are now expressing near-record enthusiasm levels, fresh polling data shows. While the figures from Gallup indicate rising enthusiasm among all voters – including Republicans – over the past five months, comparative figures show a much steeper increase among Democrats – indicating that Harris’s replacement of Joe Biden as presidential candidate is the likely driving factor. The surging enthusiasm coincides with an improved general polling performance from Harris compared with Biden, who dropped out of the race last month after a poor debate performance that threatened to further depress his already stagnant numbers in survey match-ups against Donald Trump. A fresh Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed Harris leading Trump nationwide by 45% to 41% – a margin consistent with other surveys since last week’s boisterous Democratic national convention in Chicago that confirmed the US vice-president’s status as the nominee. Harris’s figures since then have generally enhanced the small leads that she had accrued since her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in July, suggesting that her standing has been further boosted by the traditional post-convention bounce that presidential candidates customarily receive. The Harris-Walz campaign’s “Fighting for Reproductive Freedom” bus tour will begin on Tuesday in Palm Beach, Florida – Donald Trump’s backyard. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, TV personality Ana Navarro, who had a prominent spot at the Democratic convention and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez will be among those onboard for what is expected to be 50 stops in swing states. Kamala Harris’s husband Doug Emhoff and Gwen Walz, Tim Walz’s wife, will also make appearances along the way. “This election is about freedom – and the American people want and deserve the freedom to make their own health care decisions,” Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “Our campaign is hitting the road to meet voters in their communities, underscore the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom, and present them with the Harris-Walz ticket’s vision to move our country forward, which stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump’s plans to drag us back. As we crisscross the country, we’ll be driving that contrast home to red and blue voters and independents.” Donald Trump continued his attempted pivot on reproductive rights yesterday while campaigning in Wisconsin alongside former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who recounted her experience with IVF. The Guardian’s Alice Herman was there, and has this report: At a town hall event in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on Thursday night, Donald Trump and the former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, now a Trump campaign surrogate, attempted to pitch themselves to the crowd as supporters of reproductive rights. Gabbard, who moderated the event after endorsing the former president earlier this week, opened the town hall with emotional remarks about her experience with in vitro fertilization. The comments came shortly after Trump said in an NBC interview that he would make the government or insurance companies pay for IVF if he is elected, although it is unclear how he would accomplish that or if he is serious about the proposal given the pivotal role he played in overturning Roe v Wade. “We were not successful in trying to get pregnant. For us, IVF seemed to be the only option and the last resort,” said Gabbard, who described to a quiet audience the costly and at times painful fertility treatment process she said she underwent 10 years ago. Following Gabbard’s comments on IVF, Trump reiterated his promise from earlier in the day. “We wanna produce babies in this country, right?” he said. By stating his support for IVF and claiming that he would leave abortion laws to the states if elected, Trump is hoping to retain the support of women who count reproductive rights as a top issue – but risks alienating his supporters on the religious right. Reproductive rights has been a major vulnerability for Republicans nationwide ever since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago and allowed states to ban the procedure. As the president who appointed three of the justices who supported that ruling, Donald Trump has been no exception, and he’s lately tried to execute something of a pivot on the issue. Politico reports that the former president has signaled support for abortion access in Washington DC, going against years of attempts by the GOP to use Congress’s unique oversight of the capital to restrict the procedure in its city limits. And, yesterday, he told NBC News that he would support requiring the government or private insurers to pay for IVF for families. He also said that he would not back restrictions on the care – which Democrats have accused the GOP of wanting to do, after Alabama’s supreme court earlier this year handed down a ruling that cut off access. Here’s more on what Trump said, from NBC: “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump said before adding, “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.” Asked to clarify whether the government would pay for IVF services or whether insurance companies would do so, Trump reiterated that one option would be to have insurance companies pay “under a mandate, yes.” Abortion and IVF have been political liabilities for the GOP this year. Democrats have blasted Republicans over IVF in recent months, saying GOP-led restrictions on abortion could lead to restrictions on IVF, as well. In a statement, Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, said that “Donald Trump’s own platform could effectively ban IVF and abortion nationwide” and that “because Trump overturned Roe v. Wade, IVF is already under attack and women’s freedoms have been ripped away in states across the country. There is only one candidate in this race who trusts women and will protect our freedom to make our own health care decisions: Vice President Kamala Harris.” Good morning, US politics blog readers. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz yesterday sat for their first joint interview since launching their campaign, and outlined some of the policies they’d bring to the White House, if elected. Now, they’re looking to press the advantage over Donald Trump and JD Vance that polls continue to indicate they may have, particularly on issues of reproductive health. Their campaign this morning announced a bus tour through swing states that will focus on promoting her policies towards IVF access and abortion, and feature prominent surrogates including Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. We continue to see signs that Harris and Walz are posing a much stiffer challenge to Trump than Joe Biden did. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll published yesterday shows Harris with the advantage in all seven swing states it surveyed, even North Carolina, which hasn’t supported a Democrat since 2008. That said, it’s only one poll, and others have shown her in a weaker position with voters in these states, most notably Pennsylvania, which is viewed as perhaps the deciding state this election. Here’s what else we’re watching today: Despite his role in the overturning of Roe v Wade and his party’s pursuit of abortion restrictions nationwide, Trump tried to remake himself into a supporter of reproductive rights at a rally yesterday. We will hear more from Trump today, who will campaign in Johnstown, Pennsylvania at 4.30pm ET, and speak at a conference of conservative group Moms for Liberty at 8pm. Harris is back in Washington DC, and has no public events scheduled today. Expect speculation to grow in the coming days over when she will sit for her next interview.","2024-08-30T23:17:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/aug/30/election-trump-harris-abortion-updates"
"abortion","Anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe says she pressured South Australian MP to back out of voting deal","The anti-abortion activist Joanna Howe says she put pressure on the South Australian MP Jing Lee to back out of a voting deal on controversial “forced birth” legislation that proposed changes to the state’s abortion laws. But Howe also said she was not certain Lee was referring to her when the Liberal MLC described an “external visitor” that made her feel “pressured”, “unsafe” and “vulnerable” on the night of the vote, 16 October. “We don’t know if that’s me, she didn’t name me,” Howe told ABC Radio. It comes as South Australia’s Legislative Council president, Terry Stephens, is considering complaints about claims Howe attempted to “inappropriately influence the voting of members” on the bill, which was proposed by the Liberal MLC Ben Hood. Hood credited Howe as the “legal lead” on the legislation during his speech. Howe, a workplace law professor at the University of Adelaide, described herself on ABC radio on Wednesday as its “public face”. On Wednesday 16 October, the state parliament’s upper house narrowly voted down legislation that would force South Australians seeking an abortion after 27 weeks and six days to instead be induced, give birth, then either keep or adopt out the baby. Such late abortions are extremely rare and only done when there is significant risk to the mother or foetal abnormalities. The proposed laws were defeated by 10 votes to nine, after the debate descended into chaos when pairs offered to the Liberal MLC Michelle Lensink – who was against the bill, but absent while undergoing breast cancer treatment – were withdrawn. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Lee, who was in favour of the legislation, was slated to offer a pair for Lensink, to offset Lensink’s absence, but withdrew the offer before the vote. A visibly distressed Lee told parliament on Tuesday she was under “tremendous stress”, and apologised for the “misunderstanding, confusion and stress” affecting Lensink and others. “What people may not realise was my unexpected encounter with a very persistent visitor,” she said. “It is important for honourable members to know that I have never had any prior dealings with or met this individual before that evening; however, the person seemed to be knowledgable about every member of the Legislative Council. The encounter with this external visitor made me feel very vulnerable on the night. “For those who care to know, I have been traumatised by the incident last Wednesday night. I have suffered from a lack of sleep and continue to experience anxiety. “Unfortunately I felt unsafe and not supported that evening. Bullying, harassment and intimidation by external parties as well as those working in this place is not appropriate or acceptable under any circumstances,” she told parliament. Lee continued: “The situation last Wednesday was escalated to have an external person attempting to inappropriately influence the voting of members.” Lee welcomed Stephens’ earlier announcement he would consider complaints about the behaviour of visitors during the debate, and could take actions including barring individuals from the chamber. Howe told ABC Radio on Wednesday she was “shocked” when she first heard that Lee had offered a pair because “there is no obligation to pair on a conscience vote”. It is a longstanding convention to pair on all votes, including conscience votes. When asked on ABC Radio whether she pressured Lee to renege on the voting deal, Howe responded: “I did.” Howe said she tried to call Lee, then ran into her. She said they went into a members’ area in Parliament House. “I said, if you pair out, some of those babies that could be saved if this bill passes, won’t be saved … then I said to her, I have a public platform. “I have a voice over two and a half years on social media and speaking in the public eye about this issue of abortion, which I’m very passionate about, and I’m passionate about raising awareness. There’s 120,000 people that follow me on my email database, and I speak to them every day. “And I said, if you pair with [Lensink], you will be the reason [the bill] doesn’t proceed to committee stage. You will have neutralised the power of your vote, and I will hold you to account in the public square. “And I speak to preselectors, because many Liberal party preselectors who vote on this follow me, and I know how pro-life that membership is, and I think it will affect your preselection.” Howe said after Lee agreed not to pair, they hugged and took a selfie, and that Lee later thanked her for the conversation. Howe also claimed she had “done this very same thing to Senator Maria Kovacic in New South Wales” by calling on the Liberal party to dump her. “It was very successful,” Howe said. Kovacic has not been dumped. Several MPs have said that Howe, who was in the president’s gallery during the vote, yelled at the Liberal MLC Dennis Hood to come back and vote for the bill when he absented himself as pair for Lensink. Howe, whose website states that her goal is “to make abortion unthinkable”, has called a series of high-profile women who opposed the legislation “baby killers”. She also doubled down on that on Wednesday. “Sue me for defamation, and I will win, because it’s true,” she said. The Labor MLC Ian Hunter, who made one of the complaints, told parliament he had complained about the behaviour of “Miss Howe” in the chamber and asked Lee to help Stephens by naming the person who intimidated her and made her feel “unsafe and vulnerable”. Lee did not, but the Greens leader, Tammy Franks, rose and asked Stephens directly if he would consider Lee’s explanation as part of his inquiries and whether he would “clarify whether that complaint involves the behaviour of Prof Joanna Howe”. “Indeed it does,” Stephens said. “I will be making a statement again to this chamber before the end of this sitting week with regard to the course of action, and that is appropriate.” The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said in parliament that something was “seriously wrong” when someone’s preselection was threatened on whether or not they would honour a pair. “What dark forces are infiltrating the Liberal party to result in an increasingly extreme view that will allow this outcome to occur?” he asked. Guardian Australia has contacted Howe for comment.","2024-10-30T09:08:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/30/anti-abortion-activist-joanna-howe-says-she-pressured-south-australian-mp-to-back-out-of-voting-deal-ntwnfb"
"abortion","‘I’m not afraid. Let’s do it’: the Arizona abortion clinic testing the limits of the state’s ban","Gabrielle Goodrick’s day has barely begun and she’s already poring over a stack of legal documents. As the nurses and other doctors at her clinic start seeing the first of what will be upwards of 40 patients that day, the 59-year-old family medicine doctor and owner of Camelback Family Planning – one of Arizona’s few abortion clinics – has a decision to make. Since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, Arizona has banned all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy – with a small but vague carveout for medical emergencies. In November, Arizona voters will get to weigh in on a ballot measure that would enshrine in the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, or around 24 weeks. But that ballot initiative won’t help the 32-year-old woman in Goodrick’s waiting room. The woman had been thrilled five months ago when she’d become pregnant, seven years after the birth of her first child, until her water broke prematurely 17 weeks into her pregnancy – far too early for her baby to survive. With no amniotic fluid left in her uterus, it’s only a matter of time until an infection sets in. In the clinic’s break room, Goodrick sets down the stack of papers – which include a letter four state representatives wrote to Arizona’s attorney general this summer asking what qualified as a “medical emergency” and the attorney general’s response. Dressed in turquoise corduroy trousers and a white button-up, Goodrick pulls her hair into a claw clip before she begins describing the case to a few of the clinic’s nurses. Across the room, her colleague Barbara Zipkin, an obstetrician-gynecologist, listens in as she strokes her 5lb, 16-year-old dog Scooter. The maltese-yorkie mix is a fixture at the clinic, regularly accompanying Zipkin into patient rooms to provide emotional support. “No one will do it,” Goodrick says. So far, the only known abortions after 15 weeks in the state have been performed when a patient develops a severe infection, but Goodrick doesn’t want to make this patient wait that long. The woman’s healthcare network has already said it won’t end the pregnancy, and so she and her husband have started talking to a doctor in Las Vegas. But the six-hour drive to Nevada is no small hurdle. And that clinic – like most offering abortion care in the second and third trimester in the United States – only offers a procedure called dilation and evacuation. During a D&amp;E, a patient’s cervix is dilated, often using small rods called laminaria that slowly expand over the course of one to two days, before a doctor empties the patient’s uterus using suction or surgical instruments. It’s difficult for providers to remove the fetus intact during a D&amp;E – but this woman wants to hold her baby to say goodbye. Camelback is one of only a handful of clinics in the US offering an alternative called induction abortion. Like a medication abortion, in which patients take the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol to end a pregnancy in the first trimester, an induction abortion involves taking the same pills in the second or third trimester. Because the fetus is larger than in the first trimester, the misoprostol triggers contractions that are more akin to labor than an earlier medication abortion, and the procedure usually occurs in a hospital instead of at home. (Camelback manages the pain of that labor – which is quicker and less severe than childbirth – with painkillers and conscious sedation). The result is that patients – like this one – can hold and grieve the fetus afterwards, and even take home footprints. There’s legal risk to helping this patient – Goodrick’s not sure she would do it if the state didn’t have a Democratic governor and attorney general – but she’ll remark later how frustrating she finds it that more doctors aren’t willing to use their position to more aggressively challenge abortion restrictions. She is in a bind countless doctors have faced in the last two years, as stories of women denied emergency abortions in their home states have piled up. Zipkin agrees they need to act. From her perch on a black office chair, she responds, defiant: “I’m not afraid. Let’s do it.” *** In the aftermath of Roe, patients across the United States are seeking abortion care later in pregnancy, as a growing web of restrictions makes it increasingly difficult for them to access care sooner. And the procedure most physicians offer after the first trimester, a D&amp;E, is not always the procedure patients want – for example, if they’d prefer to hold their fetus after or avoid cervical dilation with laminaria. In the United States, abortion pills are FDA-approved through 10 weeks of pregnancy – but it’s still legal to use them “off label” later. While they’re not widely prescribed later in the US, they are the standard for second- and third-trimester care in much of northern Europe – and the World Health Organization’s abortion care guidelines describe how to use the pills up to and beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy. Goodrick and her colleagues are hopeful that educating more physicians on the use of abortion pills later in pregnancy could expand access to care across the US by allowing more physicians with labor and delivery training, rather than only doctors with the surgical skills required to perform a D&amp;E, to offer the procedure. Although conservative groups have called the abortion pill “unsafe” in an attempt to undo the FDA’s approval of the medication, Goodrick believes it could be an equalizer for physicians. In that spirit, this year they published a study sharing their experience providing hundreds of induction abortions to end pregnancies between 18 and 24 weeks before Roe fell. They also regularly host and train medical students. Offering that care has been harder – but not impossible – since Arizona banned abortions after 15 weeks. Since the ban went into effect, Camelback has directed patients whose pregnancies are past that mark to a clinic in southern California, where they’re able to receive and take mifepristone, which stops the pregnancy from progressing. The next day, after they’ve returned to Arizona, Goodrick and her team administer misoprostol, which induces contractions. They’re able to do so because the pregnancy has already ended, Goodrick says, meaning they’re essentially treating a stillbirth. It’s a loophole that Goodrick’s attorneys have reassured her is legal – and it helps patients avoid the cost of a surgical procedure and out-of-state hotel. But this patient, who has found her way to Camelback one day in mid-September, is the first the clinic will treat entirely in Arizona since the state’s 15-week ban went into effect in 2022. “When she found out that we could see her, she started crying,” Goodrick said. “She was so upset still about the hospital not helping her. She was just overwhelmingly relieved.” “I know it’s scary” for doctors to push back against restrictions, says Goodrick – and she understands that hospitals and their legal teams are even more risk averse. But she’s steadfast: “I think it’s up to the medical field to say [to the state], ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about.’” *** Goodrick never intended to provide abortion care – but early in her career she saw the need. She remembers Henry Morgentaler’s name appearing in the news when she was an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal in the 1980s. A Holocaust survivor, Morgentaler had emigrated to Canada, where he began his career, like Goodrick, as a general practitioner. Over time, he became one of the first Canadian doctors to offer vasectomies, IUDs, birth control to unmarried women, and eventually abortions – and his repeated challenges of Canadian law would lead to abortion being legalized nationwide in 1988. The next year, Goodrick enrolled in medical school. At the University of Vermont, Goodrick felt drawn to women’s health – but not obstetrics and gynecology, a surgical specialty. Instead, she gravitated toward family medicine, where she could receive some obstetrics training but follow patients through their full lives. In 1990 anti-abortion protesters descended on Burlington with the intention of closing two clinics there. That year, she co-founded a pro-choice alliance of medical students at the university. “I didn’t really think of abortions like, ‘This is what I’m going to do,’” she said. But when Goodrick began her residency at Phoenix Baptist hospital (now Abrazo Central) in 1993, she did a rotation at the local Planned Parenthood and enjoyed it. She would ultimately open a family practice clinic, where she also offered occasional abortions, though they weren’t the focus of her work. That changed after 2000, when the Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone for use in the US. Goodrick says she was the first provider in the south-west to offer the abortion pill – and she remembers patients flying in from across the country to access it. In those years, even though Roe was still standing, there were few physicians providing second-trimester abortions in the US, and one of the most prominent, George Tiller, was murdered in 2009. As she developed her skills in D&amp;E, Goodrick began to wonder, “How am I going to get help? How am I going to be doing this five days a week for the rest of my life?” The surgical procedure required advanced training, and she worried about finding other physicians to fill in at and eventually take over her practice. In 2018, Goodrick was attending the International Federation of Abortion and Contraception Professionals’ biannual conference in France when she walked into a session led by Swedish midwives. She discovered that it’s standard in Sweden to provide second trimester abortions not with surgical instruments, but with pills. “We VERY rarely use D&amp;E and almost exclusively use medical abortion,” or pills, in Sweden, said Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, via email. In the 1980s, she helped develop what would become the WHO protocol for using abortion pills in the second trimester. “Due to our geography and [the fact] that many live far from a hospital, surgical abortion in the second trimester is not feasible,” she said. Today, medication abortion in the second trimester, a rarity in the US, is available “in all OB-GYN clinics in the whole country”, she adds. It is often performed by midwives. When Goodrick returned to Arizona, she told the doctors at her clinic she wanted to bring the practice to the clinic. They were wary at first. D&amp;Es had been in use in the US since the 1970s and were by far the most common way to end a pregnancy in the second trimester; today, they make up about 95% of abortions after 14 weeks in the US. Studies in the late 2000s had found that D&amp;Es resulted in fewer complications than inductions (though research today suggests they’re equally safe) and many providers preferred a 20-minute procedure to hours-long labor. But Zipkin would get on board and today prefers the inductions. While the risk of perforating the uterus with surgical instruments during a D&amp;E is low, with induction abortions it disappears – and patients don’t have to spend the day before in discomfort as laminaria dilates their cervix. Although training in D&amp;E is still vital for any clinic offering care later in pregnancy – in case, for example, a patient’s uterus doesn’t expel all of the pregnancy tissue with pills alone – Goodrick believes the medication might allow more providers to offer abortions in areas where OB-GYNs are few and far between. *** There are about half a dozen protesters outside Camelback when Goodrick returns to work the morning after meeting with the patient who needs help as her pregnancy approaches 20 weeks. The sight isn’t unusual, and Goodrick notes that they’ll be gone by the time the Arizona sun is high in the sky, pushing temperatures into the 90s on this relatively cool summer day. Two cheerful clinic escorts greet patients at their cars and use large umbrellas to block them from the protesters’ views. As she holds the clinic door open for patients, one of the escorts – a 66-year-old sporting a rainbow vest, straw witch’s hat and a bevy of buttons and pins promoting feminism and voting rights – recalls the second-trimester abortion she received in 1999. She’d been trying to get pregnant and, at one of her regular prenatal appointments, her doctor realized her fetus had stopped growing, probably two weeks earlier. Her regular OB-GYN had been able to offer her a D&amp;E. “Now in Arizona I would not be able to do that,” she says, declining to give her name. The 32-year-old mother in need of care is now resting in a recliner inside. When she arrived at the clinic that morning, Zipkin gave her a small dose of misoprostol to induce labor and painkillers to ease the ensuing cramps. By lunchtime, when Zipkin sits down to sip an orange Sunkist, it’s delivery time: “Doctor!” a nurse beckons down the hall. Within a few minutes, Goodrick joins her in the patient’s room. Less than an hour later, they’re both back in the break room. The woman is coming out from under sedation; her husband is about to join her to say goodbye to their baby. “She did great,” Zipkin says. Goodrick has by now spoken with the Arizona attorney general, who has reassured her the case falls under her definition of a medical emergency. But she worries the Arizona department of health will still flag the case after Camelback reports it – and that the conservative county attorney could decide to prosecute the clinic despite the state AG’s position. She’s hopeful she won’t have to deal with these kinds of concerns after Arizonians vote in November on whether to enshrine the right to abortion until 24 weeks. “Obviously what happens federally is very important, but every state needs their own ballot initiative,” Goodrick said. In moments like these, Goodrick reflects on the legacies of abortion providers who came before, like Dr Tiller. “A lot of us still think of him. ‘What would he do now? How would he act? How would he be calm and sure of himself?’” she says. It’s why, she says, she told the attorney general, “In the future, if you hear of these cases and they can’t get done in the hospital, tell us. We’ll see them.”","2024-10-28T12:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/arizona-abortion-clinic"
"abortion","Four members of Illinois politician’s family killed in helicopter crash","A former Illinois state senator running for governor in 2026 is mourning the deaths of four family members killed when their helicopter crashed in Montana on Wednesday. Darren Bailey’s son Zachary, daughter-in-law Kelsey, and grandchildren Vada Rose, 12, and Samuel, seven, all perished in the incident, according to an announcement from his campaign on Thursday. The couple is survived by their 10-year-old son Finn, who was not on the aircraft. “On Wednesday evening, Darren and his wife, Cindy, received the heartbreaking news no parent ever wants to hear,” the campaign statement said. “Their son, Zachary, his wife, Kelsey, and their two young children, Vada Rose, age 12, and Samuel, age 7, tragically lost their lives in a helicopter accident in Montana.” The statement, posted to X, added that “Darren and Cindy are heartbroken by this unimaginable loss” and said the couple were “finding comfort in their faith, their family, and the prayers of so many who love and care for them”. The Baileys thanked supporters for their kindness and requested privacy “as they grieve and hold their loved ones close during this difficult time”. Authorities have not yet released information about what caused the helicopter to crash or where in Montana the incident took place. The type of helicopter involved has also not been disclosed. Bailey, 59, is mounting his second campaign for Illinois governor, having been defeated by the Democratic incumbent, JB Pritzker, in the 2022 race in one of the most expensive non-presidential races in American history. He secured the Republican nomination that year but lost by a wide margin in the general election. The southern Illinois politician was previously an elected state senator and earlier was a lawmaker in the state’s House of Representatives. He is again seeking the Republican nomination for the 2026 gubernatorial election on a conservative line, and is staunchly opposed to abortion, strongly supports gun rights and law enforcement, and is critical of criminal justice reforms, in what would be his second attempt to challenge for the state’s top office.","2025-10-23T14:28:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/darren-bailey-family-killed-helicopter-crash"

"abortion","Unearthed: the interview that reveals answer to abortion question David Crisafulli has dodged more than 132 times","Queensland’s opposition leader, David Crisafulli, told a live audience last year “I don’t believe in late-term abortions” and promised MPs a conscience vote on the issue. The Liberal National party leader has been dogged by the issue for weeks, refusing to declare his hand on a bill which will be introduced by Katter’s Australian party next parliament, including whether he would vote for it or grant other MPs a conscience vote. But in previously unreported remarks at a Griffith University event on 31 May 2023, the opposition leader was asked by the former ABC 7.30 host Kerry O’Brien: “Where are you on abortion and women’s rights?” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “Well, it’s a conscience vote,” Crisafulli responded. “I voted against the legislation, and I did so, and I articulated my reasons because I thought the content of the bill was too far.” Like all but three members of his party, Crisafulli voted against legalising abortion in 2018. He did not speak on the bill. “Do you fundamentally embrace a woman’s right to choose?” O’Brien then asked. “I don’t believe in late-term abortions, and that was the debate that was had,” Crisafulli responded. “Now, if you’re asking me about, would I ever support recriminalising it, the answer is absolutely no … but those issues are a conscience vote and I will never, ever be the kind of leader that tries to lock people into that … “On the times that we’ve had an opportunity, I have made sure that not only did I mouth those words, I gave support to the people who wanted to vote in support of that, and we were better as a party for it.” In the Sky News/Courier Mail debate on Tuesday night, premier Steven Miles put the same question to Crisafulli. “Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose, yes or no?” he asked. “It probably won’t work for his TikTok, but yes,” Crisafulli responded. He did not clarify during the debate if he had changed his mind on support for conscience vote on the issue, or if he would allow his MPs a conscience vote on the issue in state parliament. The debate, dubbed “the People’s Debate”, was largely dominated by questions from ordinary voters. One, identified as Brett, asked about the issue. “There will be no changes to abortion laws if government changes in Queensland,” Crisafulli responded. Crisafulli had been the opposition leader for more than two years when he attended the Griffith University event in 2023, held at Home of the Arts on the Gold Coast, called Reshaping the Centre-Right in Queensland: Kerry O’Brien in conversation with David Crisafulli. He spoke about his program of reform for the conservative party, describing himself as a moderate committed to decentralisation of the LNP. It was part of the Griffith University’s “in conversation” series of interviews, led by the former ABC journalist. Many opposition MPs told parliament in 2018 they opposed the bill because it permitted abortions “on demand” before 22 weeks and after then with medical approval. They also objected to provisions permitting late-gestation terminations “for undefined social reasons” and a lack of a “true and complete conscientious objection right for medical professionals”, along with on protests outside health clinics. “Put simply, the Labor government has not made the case for such an extreme piece of legislation,” the LNP MP David Janetzki said at the time. The KAP leader, Robbie Katter, has promised to reintroduce at least the same bill he did last term, which would give registered health practitioners a duty to “provide medical care and treatment to a person born as a result of a termination”. Katter has said he would consider introducing stronger legislation depending on how many conservative LNP MPs are elected in October. After a week of dodging questions on whether LNP would be granted a conscience vote, Crisafulli last week gave a “personal guarantee” that “we are not changing that law”. He has yet to rule out a conscience vote or explain his own views on the issue. If granted a conscience vote, LNP MPs would choose themselves which way to vote on the bill. A number of them have been reported as advocating for change. Jon Krause told a community candidate forum in September: “We need to ensure that there are enough people in the parliament to be able to repeal those laws or to make significant amendments.” The Stretton LNP candidate Freya Ostapovitch was recorded at a polling booth last week telling a voter “I am pro-life” but “I can’t say anything yet because we have got to get elected before we do anything”.","2024-10-22T10:02:49Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli"

These maps show the ‘deserts’ for care in the state","To better understand where women in New South Wales are most struggling to access abortion, researchers led by the University of Sydney and the data visualisation specialist Ri Liu have mapped access to surgical abortion (a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting) and medication abortion (taking prescribed abortion pills) across the state. The following maps use publicly available directories but it’s worth noting that not all abortion services were openly advertised or easy to find, providers can change and that the circumstances under which abortions were provided were not transparent. The project was inspired by US researchers, who first used the term “abortion desert” to describe places 100 miles (160km) or more from the nearest abortion service. The Abortion Desert Map was developed by the Access All Areas research collective at the University of Sydney and Ri Liu, an independent data visualisation specialist.

"abortion","Amy-Clare had an abortion. Queensland’s current debate around the issue makes her feel like a criminal","When Brisbane mother Amy-Clare learned she was pregnant a second time, she almost opted not to undertake prenatal genetic testing. “We were really happy – we really wanted that baby,” she recalls. Because she already had a healthy first child, Amy-Clare was inclined to believe things would go smoothly the second time. But for peace of mind, her partner talked her into getting the expensive test, which screens for chromosomal disorders early in pregnancy. The test, in January 2021, showed that the foetus had an extra copy of chromosome 18. It was a serious genetic condition. Most babies affected die prenatally, or not long after birth. Hopes that there had been a testing error were dashed when Amy-Clare had an ultrasound late in her first trimester. The specialist performing the scan narrated to the couple what she saw: the baby’s stomach was outside the body, she couldn’t find evidence of any kidneys, the head was enlarged. The baby would be unlikely to make it to birth, they were told. Amy-Clare and her partner were left alone in the room, processing the news. “We knew, even from that moment,” she says. “Walking around pregnant [for months longer], knowing you’re expecting a miscarriage at any point, would have been traumatic. I wasn’t going to put myself through that; I wasn’t going to put my body through that.” Unable to access a termination of pregnancy at her local public hospital, Amy-Clare had an abortion at a private clinic. “I remember the doctor who performed the abortion holding my hand and saying: there’ll be another baby.” Amy-Clare says it would be “an absolute nightmare” if abortion were to be recriminalised in Queensland. “I can’t imagine someone who had to go through what I had to go through doing that and feeling like a criminal as well,” she says. “Even though my abortion felt like the only choice for medical reasons … anyone who has a pregnancy they don’t want should be able to terminate that pregnancy and to do so safely.” When the bill that would legalise abortion came before the Queensland parliament in 2018, all but three Liberal National party MPs voted against it. David Crisafulli, who is now the party’s leader, and his current deputy, Jarrod Bleijie, were among those opposed to legalisation. At a live event last year, Crisafulli said he did not “believe in late-term abortions”, Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday. Throughout the Queensland election campaign, the opposition leader has repeatedly refused to rule out a conscience vote on the issue if elected, despite giving a “personal guarantee” that abortion laws would not change. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email On Monday, leading health organisations including the professional bodies for GPs (RACGP) and obstetricians and gynaecologists (RANZCOG) released a joint statement saying a recriminalisation of abortion in Queensland “would be a harmful step backwards, risking the health and safety of pregnant people and undoing years of progress.” When Brisbane psychologist Lara was pregnant with her first baby, a girl, she was devastated to learn during her 20-week scan that brain abnormalities had been identified. An MRI a few days later showed that the foetus had agenesis of the corpus callosum, a rare birth defect in which the band of nerve fibres connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain does not form properly. In isolation, the condition can cause impairments ranging from mild to severe. But doctors weren’t able to rule out other disorders such as Aicardi syndrome, which causes recurrent seizures. Lara found herself desperate not to be pregnant. But it was 2017, when abortion was still illegal in Queensland, and to access a termination of pregnancy through the public system she was told she would have to declare before a panel of doctors that she was at risk of killing herself. At the time, women who had “unlawful” abortions faced up to seven years’ imprisonment. Abortion providers could be penalised with up to 14 years, with exemptions from criminal liability “to preserve the mother’s life”. “I didn’t feel like I was willing to say that I was suicidal at a point when I wasn’t, even though, in hindsight, I was extremely distressed,” Lara recalls. She looked into the possibility of travelling interstate, but decided against it because it would probably delay the termination she sought. “At the time, I was visibly pregnant, and being in public was like torture for me,” she says. “The experience of being pregnant when you no longer want to be pregnant is just excruciating.” Lara eventually found a private obstetrician who performed an induced labour termination, treating her with compassion and not without professional risk. “That was just pure luck that I was able to find someone … and my own privilege, being a healthcare worker.” Lara has since had two children. “I was so scared to have another baby and to [potentially] go through it again,” she says. During her second pregnancy, abortion was legalised in Queensland. “It was healing for me when that law changed. I didn’t want anyone else to go through [what I did].” “So-called ‘late term abortion’ looks like my story – a very wanted pregnancy, devastating news, a heavy decision and a lot of grief no matter what you decide.” Prof Deborah Bateson, a clinician researcher and female reproductive health expert at the Daffodil Centre, points out that abortions in later gestation are rare, and carried out as a result of medically or socially complex situations. “These are never, ever decisions that are taken lightly.” There is no standardised national data on abortion currently available in Australia, but South Australian data showed that 89.5% of terminations in the state in 2023 occurred before 14 weeks’ gestation, which is in line with US statistics finding the vast majority of abortions occur in the first trimester. The criminalisation of abortion can lead to an increase in unsafe abortions, Bateson says. “We’ve seen that in the United States.” “To think that we could have [a] retrograde step back is a very shocking thing for reproductive rights in Australia, but it does show that we can’t take things for granted.” Criminalising abortion would result in an inequitable system that limits reproductive healthcare access to those most financially well off or able to travel, says Jill McKay, the chief executive of Children by Choice, which offers Queensland-wide counselling services for pregnancy decision-making. “The World Health Organization is incredibly clear that abortion is healthcare,” McKay says. “To put it into any other sphere stigmatises our healthcare workers but most importantly injures the health and wellbeing of women.” “Children by Choice will always be here to continue to advocate for safe, compassionate, affordable, legal abortion care.” “I’ve never regretted the decision I made,” Lara says. “But when you give someone only one option, it’s a recipe for regret and resentment.” That abortion rights could be stripped again is “so unfair and so distressing,” she says. “How depressing for every woman.” “If you or your daughter got the same news at their 20-week scan, I guarantee that you’d want to be able to make an informed and difficult choice about what suffering you can endure, and what suffering you can spare your unborn child.” “You might not make the same choice as me, but there is still enormous relief and strength that comes from being able to choose what the future looks like for you and your family.” “If anyone finds themselves in this situation, no matter what happens with the laws, they’re not alone. You’re not alone.”","2024-10-25T14:00:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/26/queensland-election-abortion-policy-lnp-crisafulli"
"abortion","Strap in for a feral lead-up into Christmas in the NSW parliament","As the New South Wales parliament draws to a close at the end of November, expect it to be dominated by feral horses, feral pigs and feral politics. The Minns Labor government has two major pieces of legislation it desperately wants to pass before parliament rises. But it faces obstacles in the upper house where a clutch of minor parties hold the balance of power. The first is the bill to streamline the planning system. The changes have been billed as necessary to fast-track major housing projects, but it’s become clear that the bill could also apply to mining and energy projects. The Greens say it gives the planning minister unprecedented powers to decide that the public interest or environmental matters can be ignored. That’s why they are opposing the bill and calling for significant amendments. The bill will probably pass with the support of the Coalition, which is also proposing amendments. But it’s a race against time and there is no guarantee the Nationals won’t arc up about abolishing regional planning, and fast-tracking transmission lines and windfarms. The other big headache for the government is changes to the workers’ compensation system, to dramatically curtail claims for psychological injury. It has been trying to gain support since May, warning that the entire system is in danger of financial collapse and that premiums will skyrocket. But there’s pretty much universal condemnation of the bill from the Liberals, Greens, union movement, doctors, psychologists and lawyers. Another parliamentary report due soon, on the proposal to lift the threshold for whole-of person impairment from 15% to 31% and icare’s handling of cases, will be highly critical. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The government has not given up on getting its workers’ comp legislation through the upper house, but it needs six votes from the minor parties – which may require some serious horse-trading. One option being touted is to extend parliament for an extra day (or days) into the reserve week, with additional time to get private members’ bills through. This would be a way of wooing support, as it would deliver several crossbenchers a win on their pet projects – and the attendant publicity that goes with it. A spokesperson for the government said an extra day “may be needed to pass legislation” but it was hoped it wouldn’t be necessary. Several private members’ bills are in the pipeline: the Shooters and Fishers’ conservation hunting bill, Dr Joe McGirr’s repeal of the heritage horse act that protected brumbies, a bill to restrict voluntary assisted dying in faith-run aged care, and a bill making sex-selection abortions illegal. So first to the feral pigs. The government walked away from its overt support for a hunting bill proposed by the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party after a campaign by anti-gun lobbyists, led by Walter Mikac whose wife and children, Alannah and Madeline, were killed during the Port Arthur massacre. A spokesperson for the premier, Chris Minns, confirmed in September the government would not use its business time to support the passage of the legislation, meaning the Shooters would need to try to push the bill through a largely hostile upper house while dealing with the dozens of amendments. “Labor will never vote to water down gun laws – not now, not ever, and we have made clear we are not supporting a right to hunt,” a spokesperson said at the time. But Labor desperately needs the Shooters’ votes for workers’ compensation. While it denies there is a deal, it will probably vote for a watered down bill – if the bill can ride its way through to a vote. The feral horses bill is easier – Labor, the Libs and the Greens are supporting it. It just needs the debate time. That would be a win for the Legalise Cannabis party’s Jeremy Buckingham, who is championing the bill in the upper house. Then there are the two other private members’ bills that will go to a conscience vote. John Ruddick of the Libertarian party is proposing the abortion amendment, which he says would introduce fines for doctors who perform sex-selection abortions. He says a more recent study from Edith Cowan University looking at birth numbers has undermined the findings of a 2020 parliamentary committee, which found that the number of sex-selection abortions in NSW was negligible. Abortion is always a lightning rod issue, evidenced by the crowd of 500-plus who blocked Macquarie Street last Wednesday to mark the introduction of Ruddick’s bill. He doesn’t think it will get debated until next year. Voluntary assisted dying is also one of those issues that will unite the conservatives in the upper house. The Liberal MLC Susan Carter has introduced a bill to parliament to amend VAD laws to allow residential aged care providers which object to VAD on faith grounds to “decline to facilitate the administration of voluntary assisted dying services in the same way, and subject to the same obligations to make alternative arrangements, as hospitals”. It’s got support among fellow Liberals and from Mark Latham and the Shooters. Labor has said it will be a conscience vote, so it too may pass. Whether the government can cobble together the six votes it needs in the upper house to allow more time for private bills remains to be seen. But this strategy, if it goes forward, will mean the hunting bill is back on the agenda and the workers’ compensation legislation stands a fighting chance.

"abortion","Australian conservatives claim babies are sometimes ‘born alive’ after an abortion. What’s the truth?","Some religious groups and conservative politicians in Australia have claimed babies are being “born alive” after abortions and left to die alone. But experts warn “born alive” campaigns are riddled with misinformation, use misleading statistics and could threaten women’s access to abortions. So what’s really going on? A proposed federal bill to supposedly protect those born alive went to a parliamentary inquiry, which found there was no basis for it. A motion in the federal Senate last week to note that babies were born alive after abortions was defeated. Meanwhile, a Queensland inquiry into proposed legislation is ongoing. A recent emotional address from the Australian Christian Lobby’s Louise Adsett on “unwanted babies” being left in “witches’ hats” received broad media coverage. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Queensland health minister, Shannon Fentiman, says misinformation in the debate can be inflammatory and cause hurt to bereaved parents. Here’s what you need to know. Are babies sometimes born alive after an abortion? Dozens of health experts and major organisations have told inquiries that, on rare occasions, an unviable baby is born alive. The Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog) has told a Queensland inquiry it’s an “uncommon” scenario. Ranzcog says only 1% of abortions are performed after 20 weeks’ gestation. Usually an injection would be used to ensure the foetus is dead. “In rare cases, parents may choose not to have foeticide because they want to hold their (non-viable) baby while it dies,” Ranzcog says. The baby, which has no chance of survival, is kept comfortable during the process. The “born alive” campaign has used various statistics to claim this happens hundreds of times a year. However, there aren’t even robust national statistics on the number of abortions each year (one estimate is about 88,000). The ACL claims such babies are fully developed with beating hearts but “set aside and left to die”, a claim repeatedly debunked by health professionals. The Queensland Nurses and Midwives’ Union says abortions after 20 weeks’ gestation occur where “the foetus has late-diagnosed lethal or significant abnormalities, genetic conditions, severe growth restriction, or maternal health risks, where continuing the pregnancy and/or birth poses a significant threat to the mother and the foetus has zero chance of survival”. The bill “projects an unnecessary narrative on to a rare scenario and places undue pressure and emotional manipulation on women, pregnant people, and their families”, the union says. What’s the legislation all about? Proponents of born alive legislation want it made explicit that any child born after abortion should receive the same duty of care as any other child, raising the spectre of health providers feeling pressured to try to resuscitate a baby that was never going to live. In the US, there have been a range of “born alive” state-based laws, and a federal attempt to impose fines and prison terms on anyone who does not try to save a baby, even if not viable. The former federal MP George Christensen first proposed a born alive bill in 2021 to require medical practitioners to provide “medical care, treatment and statistics on children born alive as a result of terminations”. That lapsed, but was reintroduced in 2022 by Liberal senator Alex Antic and National party senator Matt Canavan, and sent to an inquiry. The inquiry found there was no legal, ethical or medical basis to support the bill, and it made no recommendations for the government to respond to. A Queensland bill to “remove any doubt that babies born in these circumstances are entitled to the same degree of medical care and attention as a baby born in any other way” is before an inquiry and is due to table a report to government in September. Before the recent Northern Territory election, the new Country Liberal party leader, Lia Finocchiaro, said the party would consider supporting a similar bill. ACL and Pro-Life Victoria distributed flyers during the campaign saying the CLP supported born alive legislation. The Sphere Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Coalition says the proposed legislation compromises the right to access pregnancy termination services and “demonstrates a poor and inaccurate understanding of second trimester abortion care and the complexities of foetal viability”. The bill “may dissuade providers from performing late-term abortions due to fear of prosecution in the extremely rare event a baby is born alive”, it says in its submission. In its submission, the Royal Women’s Hospital says the anti-abortionists’ strategy was to “erode rights by multiple minor legislations”. “These are aimed at limiting the provision of, and access to, services. We believe this bill can be understood as such a strategy,” it says. The Western Australia health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, told parliament that invasive medical care, such as attempts to resuscitate a neonate who is not going to survive, “would rob” parents of that time with their baby. Do doctors have a duty of care after a termination? “All practitioners are bound by a duty of care which informs when and how they may perform their duties in such a scenario,” Sphere says. Ranzcog says any additional legislation is “entirely unnecessary”. It argues duty of care includes babies born alive “whether this happens following an abortion or otherwise”. “Further legal regulation will be confusing and unhelpful,” it says, and would create a law that treats abortion differently to other medical procedures. The born alive lobby claim more medical intervention could save those aborted babies. The explanatory notes for the Queensland bill claim a 2023 study of 29 babies born at 22 weeks had a survival rate of 82.8%. The QNMU says the study “excludes neonates with major congenital anomalies”. The study found all neonates born at 22 weeks received intensive, invasive medical intervention, a third of which died before the age of 18 months, and of those that did survive, 38.9% showed moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, the union says. Are babies left alone for hours? A few anecdotes are doing the heavy lifting on the claim that babies are being born alive and left for hours. The 1998 case of “Jessica Jane” is often used. According to the coroner’s report, in a small Darwin hospital, a foetus was unexpectedly born alive after a termination. There was confusion over the gestation age. The nurse present didn’t know what to do, and the treating doctor did not help her. The nurse wrapped the baby in a “warm rug” and constantly checked on it. But the coroner heard it would only have had an “extremely small” chance of survival no matter what. It died 80 minutes later. The coroner recommended protocols be put in place to prevent the rare event happening again. Another case often mentioned is “Xanthe”. A Queensland couple decided to have a termination after they found out their daughter had Down’s syndrome. Xanthe was born alive. The father said they were not told and would have wanted to be with her when she died. The case was reportedly being investigated by the ombudsman, who declined to provide an update. Then there’s Adsett, a midwife who appeared for the ACL at the Queensland inquiry. Adsett says she is a “conscientious objector when it comes to providing care for women aborting their babies” but that she makes herself available to hold babies afterwards. She says parents do not want to see or hold them and they are “sometimes born into witches’ hats or kidney dishes”. She says she was either on shift or her colleagues told her about such occasions. Fentiman, Queensland’s health minister, says “all babies born with signs of life are treated with the same dignity, respect and access to healthcare as any other person in Queensland”. Some remarks in the debate have been inflammatory, Fentiman says, and have the potential to cause hurt to parents already grieving the loss of a child. “I ask those responsible to stop and think about the hurt you are causing.”","2024-08-27T15:00:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/28/australian-conservatives-claim-babies-are-sometimes-born-alive-after-an-abortion-whats-the-truth"
"abortion","Everyone’s got a theory on Taylor Swift’s engagement – even JD Vance","The secret meanings behind Taylor Swift’s engagement Breaking news alerts were pinged to phones around the world; Swifties screamed in the street; the Prince and Princess of Wales delivered their royal approval; Donald Trump wished them luck. By now it will not have escaped your attention that Taylor Swift, the reigning queen of pop, is engaged to Travis Kelce, a podcaster who also plays football. What does this engagement mean? It’s possible you naively think it simply means an extremely famous woman and a somewhat famous man enjoy each other’s company and want to settle down together to start a big, beautiful brand partnership. Wrong! When it comes to Swift, Occam’s razor rarely applies. The megastar is known for hiding Easter eggs and hidden meaning in her musical output; she has driven a lot of otherwise normal people on quixotic missions into the deep, dark depths of her lyrics to validate their left-field theories about their idol. Who can forget, for example, the 5,000-word essay published in the New York Times last year arguing that Swift is secretly part of the LGBTQ+ community and communicating that fact via coded lyrics? A surprisingly large number of “Gaylors” seem invested in this theory: a Gaylor subreddit has more than 50,000 members. Following news of the proposal, it went private to avoid trolling from outsiders. While the engagement has sent some Gaylors into mourning, various conservatives are celebrating the idea that Swift might be on her way from being an independent career woman to a tradwife. On his podcast, the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk mused that getting married and having kids changes a person, and he hopes that it will “deradicalize” the billionaire – who is, it must be said, not widely known for having any radical ideas. “Taylor Swift might go from a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter,” Kirk said. “I think that if she ends up having children, she’ll stop this kind of liberal endorsing Joe Biden nonsense.” (Well, I mean, she’s not going to be endorsing Biden any more, that’s for sure.) Kirk added: “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” Oh, I think she is. While Vance himself hasn’t weighed in on whether he thinks the Kelce effect will mean Swift suddenly has a Mar-a-Lago makeover and starts fangirling over Maga politics, he has aired his thoughts on the news. More specifically, he used the Swift-Kelce engagement to float the conspiracy theory that NFL games could be rigged for Kelce’s team, the Chiefs. “I hope that the NFL does not put a thumb on the scale for the Kansas City Chiefs just because Travis Kelce is now getting married to maybe the most famous woman in the world,” Vance told USA Today in an interview on Wednesday. It’s not just the right projecting their hopes, dreams and weird Super Bowl fantasies on to Kelce-Swift. Some Swifties have been gushing over what a great guy Kelce is because “he has no issue with Swift being successful”. While Kelce may well be supportive of his megastar fiancee, let’s not get carried away and frame him as some sort of feminist. The football star has called women “breeders” in the past and defended his Kansas City Chiefs teammate Harrison Butker after Butker delivered a bigoted commencement speech last year, calling Pride month a “deadly sin” and telling women they should be more excited about getting married and having kids than having a successful career. Kelce made clear that he doesn’t agree with the majority of Butker’s views, but said it wasn’t his place to criticize them. Kind of a slap in the face to all of Swift’s queer fans for her husband-to-be to let the Pride comments slide, just because Butker has always been nice to him. Various other hot takes about the engagement abound. The business press have been talking about how the engagement might boost stocks and marketing trade journals have been looking at brand reactions. No doubt even defence industry publications (which have previously put out bangers like What Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Can Teach Veterans About Federal Resumes) will find an angle. If you can’t beat them, join them: since it’s the Swift Hot Take Super Bowl, I’ll quickly get mine in. I think the singer is very talented, and I’m glad she makes a lot of people very happy, but I do wish she would do a Ms Rachel and use her unmatched influence to shame politicians into action on Gaza. Or at least follow the lead of the YouTuber Lindsay Ellis and raise money for suffering kids. Parents are having to watch their children wither away amid a man-made famine facilitated (and denied) by the US. Doctors are coming back from Gaza with harrowing stories about Israeli soldiers targeting kids with shots to the head and deliberately shooting teenage boys in the testicles. You can argue all day about whether celebrities have an obligation to speak out about injustice or not but, ultimately, having so much influence and choosing not to use it in the face of a genocide your government is helping to perpetuate, and your engagement knocks from the front page, is not “neutrality”. It is a deliberate choice. Amnesty calls for end of investigation into Polish doctor who performed abortion Last year, Dr Gizela Jagielska was targeted by anti-abortion extremists after she provided a legal late-term abortion to a woman in a hospital in southern Poland after her unborn baby was diagnosed with a fatal foetal anomaly. Poland has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Jagielska is being investigated by authorities and faces possible imprisonment of up to eight years. “Instead of investigating Dr Jagielska’s conduct, the Polish authorities must look into the attacks she has faced since the investigation was announced,” Amnesty International said in a statement this week. Now I ain’t saying she’s a gold digger … but she is trademarking the term What first attracted the 24-year-old former cheerleader Jordon Hudson to the 73-year-old multimillionaire Bill Belichick, I wonder? We may never know. But do we know that Hudson’s company has filed a trademark application for the term “gold digger”, to be used on jewellery or keychains. Instead of getting huffy about the jokes about her being attracted to Belichick’s big bank account, she’s monetizing them. Italian police investigating porn site with doctored pictures of prominent women If you are a woman in the public eye, it’s almost inevitable that insecure men will use technology to humiliate you online.

Snoop Dogg is ‘scared to go to the movies’ because of animated lesbians The musician has called himself a “gangsta” but he’s apparently terrified of two fictional women parenting a child together. Snoop told a podcast he was horrified when he took his grandson to see Pixar’s Lightyear and the child asked about the two gay mums in the movie. Instead of just answering his grandson’s question like a normal person, Snoop clutched his pearls. Denmark apologises for forced contraception of Greenlandic women It’s estimated that 4,500 women and girls were fitted with contraceptive coils without their permission or knowledge in the 1960s in an attempt to reduce the population of Greenland.

"abortion","Push to stop NSW hospitals opting out of abortions as healthcare ‘deserts’ exposed","Public hospitals should not be able to “opt out of” providing abortions, according to the Greens MP Dr Amanda Cohn, who said despite abortion being decriminalised in New South Wales five years ago “far too little has changed”. Her comments came in response to data published by Guardian Australia on Tuesday that shows just three public hospitals in the state provide surgical abortion outside of emergencies. The majority of the state’s cities and towns are “abortion deserts”, meaning the nearest service is more than 160km away, obfuscated, and often costly. “Abortion is healthcare – it’s not something hospitals with public funding and the capability to provide abortion should be able to opt out of,” Cohn said. “We would never accept a public hospital turning away all patients with diabetes or all patients who needed a knee replacement.” Cohn, who was a provider of medical abortion before entering politics, acknowledged the “excellent clinicians in our public hospitals doing their best to provide abortion care”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email But when Guardian Australia asked 15 local health districts which of their public hospitals provide abortion, and under what circumstances, none responded. They did not respond to questions around what happens to a woman denied an abortion. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, would also not provide these specific details, nor would the health department. Cohn said when services are “ad hoc or not publicly communicated, it adds to patients’ distress and delays what is a time sensitive procedure”. “Decriminalising abortion in NSW five years ago was a critical first step but since then far too little has changed,” she said. “When abortion was still in the Crimes Act in NSW, people travelled from across western NSW to Wodonga [in Victoria] to access care, where I was working as an abortion provider. “This is still happening.” Cohn has given notice of a bill that would allow nurse practitioners and midwives with appropriate training to prescribe medical abortion. “I’ve also called on the NSW government to fund abortion care in all public hospitals that provide reproductive health services.” The NSW premier, Chris Minns, did not respond to questions about funding of abortion care and the lack of information provided by health districts. He referred the questions back to the health minister. In November, Minns said he recognised the importance of the public hospital network in the provision of abortion. “That will be fully funded, and the services will be available,” he told parliament at the time. Dr Madeleine Belfrage, from the University of Sydney’s Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre, was among the researchers to map the NSW abortion deserts highlighted by Guardian Australia. She said while decriminalisation was an important step, “it is only part of the solution”. “We are yet to see the necessary changes in the health system to ensure that abortion is provided as routine healthcare,” she said. A co-author of the research, Dr Anna Noonan, said; “That politicians and health leaders are unwilling to respond to simple queries implies two things. “First, the health system and its decision-makers are actively contributing to the inaccessibility of abortion care for many people, and two, how can clinical staff and constituents navigate referral pathways when those in power cannot even answer where services are?” Asked about the lack of information at a press conference on Tuesday, the NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said: “Of course the health minister has been dealing with that issue and we did intervene to ensure that abortion services are available in certain regional hospitals when they were going to be withdrawn.” Pushed by Guardian Australia on whether the level of access revealed by the Guardian today was acceptable, Mookhey said: “Again look, I make the point again, our expectation’s pretty clear that people have access to abortion services when they need it. Of course the operational details of that are under the health minister.” The chief executive of Family Planning Australia, Sue Shilbury, said NSW “does lag behind other states in providing access to abortion services in the public health setting”. Shilbury said NSW Health needs to publish the data it collects annually around abortion services, which would lead to greater transparency around demand for and provision of those services. She also said legislation needs to change to allow for nurse prescribing of medical abortion, and services needed to be expanded beyond just hospital settings. For example, John Hunter hospital in Newcastle on the north coast and the Royal Women’s hospital in Sydney provide surgical abortion, but only for women in their local catchment area. “I think it’s important that there be greater clarity about the role that regional-based hospitals play in providing access to abortion services, and pathways for women need to be more clearly delineated,” Shilbury said. “It should be easy for women to know exactly what and where their options are at nine weeks, versus 10 weeks or 15 weeks or more gestation.”","2024-12-17T14:00:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/18/push-to-stop-nsw-hospitals-opting-out-of-abortions-as-healthcare-deserts-exposed"
"abortion","MPs propose decriminalising abortion up to 24 weeks","A cross-party group of MPs is proposing to make abortion access a human right in England and Wales, putting forward legislation that would decriminalise abortion up to 24 weeks and introduce protections against access being stripped back. Proposals to modernise abortion law have been made in the form of amendments to the government’s criminal justice bill, which is due to be debated after parliament returns from its Easter recess later this month. The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, will choose which ones are voted on. MPs are expected to be given a free vote. This latest proposal, tabled by MPs last week, seeks to protect the women who have abortions and the medical staff who provide them from prosecution. It would modernise the law by decriminalising abortion up to 24 weeks and introduce a “lock” to ensure future legislation and guidance protects the right to abortion. This lock seeks to ensure that abortion access can be restricted only if that is the explicit will of parliament. The amendment is backed by Stella Creasy, the Labour MP and abortion rights campaigner, and Dan Poulter, a former Tory health minister and doctor specialising in women’s health. Other MPs who have signed it include Labour’s Sarah Owen and Charlotte Nichols and the Green party’s Caroline Lucas. “Enshrining abortion as a human right will prevent further attacks on access as well as those who assist women to ensure abortion can be safe, legal and local,” Creasy said. “The public is very clear – the 95% of women who have early abortions should not have to justify their choice, and the small number of women who tragically have abortions towards the end of pregnancy need our support, not to be sent to prison. It is time that our law reflected this, and came into line with the rest of western Europe.” The MPs’ proposal is partly modelled on legislation introduced in Northern Ireland in 2019, where abortion law is now less restrictive than in England and Wales. Abortions in Northern Ireland are decriminalised. The Northern Ireland secretary, currently Chris Heaton-Harris, bears responsibility under the legislation for preventing a rollback in abortion access. Creasy said: “The lesson from Northern Ireland is to ensure someone in government has direct responsibility to prevent attacks behind the scenes on abortion service provision by those who oppose it – preventing those who oppose abortion from using seemingly progressive changes in law as an excuse to issue guidance or regulations by the back door which roll back advances such as telemedicine or time limits.” This latest proposal gives MPs another way to modernise abortion laws in England and Wales. An existing proposal to fully decriminalise abortion made by Diana Johnson, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, has gathered traction among MPs. Johnson’s proposal would abolish the criminal offence associated with a woman ending her own pregnancy, mirroring the law in Northern Ireland. The Guardian reported last month that some senior Labour figures were concerned that Johnson’s proposal goes too far because of the provision of telemedicine in England and Wales, which allows women to terminate in the early stages by taking tablets at home without seeing a doctor. This is not an option in Northern Ireland. Johnson’s proposal would mean that a woman who misleads an abortion provider in order to obtain pills to terminate a pregnancy at home after 24 weeks would not be committing an offence. At present, abortion law in England and Wales relies on the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which outlawed terminations, and is still used to prosecute women today. The Abortion Act 1967 decriminalised abortion in some circumstances, but is framed in a way that means abortion is not a right. Instead, it exempts a woman from prosecution when two doctors agree the pregnancy would be a risk to her physical or mental health. The legislation originally allowed terminations up to 28 weeks, but this was lowered to 24 weeks in a 1991 amendment.","2024-04-08T06:00:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/08/mps-propose-decriminalising-abortion-up-to-24-weeks-england-wales-stella-creasy"
"abortion","Arkansas rejects initiative seeking to ease abortion ban despite over 100,000 supporters","Arkansas officials rejected a ballot initiative that sought to loosen the state’s strict abortion ban, after canvassers delivered more than 101,000 signatures to state offices. In a letter, the secretary of state, John Thurston, said he would reject the canvassers’ attempt to appear on the November ballot because they failed to submit sworn statements by paid canvassers. “You did not submit any statements meeting this requirement,” Thurston said in a letter on Wednesday. “By contrast, other sponsors of initiative petitions complied with this requirement. Therefore, I must reject your submission.” Thurston said that even if he had not rejected the ballot measure for lack of sworn statements by paid canvassers, he would have rejected the signatures they collected. Of the 101,525 signatures submitted, 14,143 were collected by paid canvassers. Excluding them left campaigners 3,322 signatures short of what is required to appear on the fall ballot. Republicans in the state cheered the rejection. “Today is a great day for life in Arkansas,” said Ben Gilmore, an Arkansas state senator. “Life is the most basic God-given human right and Arkansas will continue to protect the lives of our unborn children.” Arkansans for Limited Government (AFLG), reproductive rights canvassers in the state, called the disqualification “ridiculous”, said they worked with the secretary’s office at “multiple junctures” and called the sworn statement requirement an “unfounded legal interpretation”. “More than 101,000 Arkansans participated in this heroic act of direct democracy and stood up to proclaim their support for access to healthcare,” said AFLG. “They deserve better than a state government that seeks to silence them. “We will fight this ridiculous disqualification attempt with everything we have. We will not back down.” The ballot measure would have asked voters to allow abortion up to 20 weeks’ gestation and later in cases of rape or incest, when a pregnancy causes a life-threatening condition for a woman, or if a fetus is unlikely to survive. Today, Arkansas bans abortion at conception, affecting 668,000 women of reproductive age. Although the state allows abortions in the case of medical emergencies, the state department of health reported zero abortions in 2023, according to NBC News. Recent polls show support for abortion rights has risen since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision that provided a constitutional protection for abortion rights for nearly 50 years. Before the supreme court’s decision, abortion restrictions were a point of strength for the Republican party. The issue of restrictions reliably turned out conservative voters, even as the party faced little risk that severe restrictions would go into effect. After Donald Trump successfully shifted the balance of the court and Roe v Wade was overturned, 14 states enacted near-total abortion bans. As stories of the hardships of women and families have emerged, and Republicans attacked even basic fertility services, support for abortion rights has risen nationally and momentum swung decidedly to the left. Still, the ballot measure in Arkansas faced an uphill battle. Polls note that the state is one of only five nationally where a minority of voters (46%) believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases.","2024-07-11T13:44:52Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/11/arkansas-abortion-ballot-initiative"
"abortion","‘One-man anti-abortion army’: shadow of US global gag rule looms over Nepal’s family planning services","“One, two, three,” says Soman Rai slowly, to the click of his fingers. “Every three seconds a baby dies by abortion. One, two, three,” he repeats. Behind him, the word “Abortion” is projected on to a screen in a red font that drips down the slide to resemble blood. Underneath is written: Abortion is world history’s greatest genocide. It is an uncompromising message in an unlikely location; a church in a remote valley in Nepal. A self-proclaimed “one-man army”, Rai says he has been taking his anti-abortion message to more than 30,000 people across Nepal since he founded his organisation, Voice of Fetus Nepal, in 2009. As an audience of about 65 gathers for his talk in the church in Beni, a small town in the foothills of the Himalayas, they greet each other with “Jay Mashiah”, meaning “praise the Lord”, instead of the traditional namaste. While Rai speaks to schools and colleges, the focus of his work is among Nepal’s growing Christian community, who eagerly embrace his anti-abortion pitch. Rai speaks with the fluency and confidence of an evangelical preacher, taking his mostly female audience on an emotional journey. His message is built on the belief that life begins at the moment of conception, and underpinned by the teachings of the Bible. Instead of abortion, Rai promotes parenting, adoption and abstinence. If his argument sounds familiar it is because his work is – at least partly – funded by anti-abortion Christian groups in the US and draws heavily on their messaging and methods. Rai’s preaching comes at a time when providers of women’s healthcare around the world are preparing for potentially disastrous consequences should Donald Trump win the US presidential election in November. When he last took office in 2017, one of his first acts was to reinstate, and later expand, an order known as the Mexico City policy. US law has long prohibited the use of foreign aid for abortions, but the policy also bars foreign organisations that receive US family planning funds from providing advice on abortion services or advocating for the liberalisation of abortion laws, even if they do so using funds from other sources. Trump greatly expanded the policy so it applies to any organisation receiving US healthcare funding. Foreign organisations wishing to access this funding must sign up to the policy, which is often referred to as the global gag rule (GGR) because of the restrictions it places on organisations to even discuss the option of abortion. Nepal first legalised abortion in 2002 and today women have the right to an abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy and in limited circumstances up to 28 weeks. The legalisation of abortion has been credited with contributing to a 72% fall in maternal mortality rates – from 539 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 1996 to 151 in 2022. Those gains are being put at risk by the GGR, say experts. A study on the impact of the policy in Nepal by the Center for Research on Environment, Health and Population Activities (Crehpa), a Nepali organisation, found that it had “created a major obstacle to improving women’s lives”, in particular among “marginalised and underserved populations”. Since the GGR was first introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, successive Republican administrations have imposed it, while the Democrats have revoked it, leaving family planning organisations such as MSI Nepal (formerly Marie Stopes International) – which refuses to sign it – caught in a cycle of funding and defunding. The consequences have been dire, says Tushar Niroula, the executive director of MSI Nepal. “You can’t strengthen the health system in four years and then stop for four years. Next time you have to start from scratch.” Niroula says his organisation had to shut down projects soon after the Trump administration took office, due to cuts in funding. “There was a huge gap overnight,” he says. The prospect of a Trump victory in November is already hampering MSI Nepal’s work. Members of a consortium bidding for US healthcare funding have been reluctant to collaborate with MSI Nepal because its refusal to sign the GGR could put the whole bid at risk, says Niroula. “US government funding is huge and extends for five to six years, which is enough time to build systems and make them sustainable. That is why the global gag rule is such a barrier,” he says. Puja Karki sees what is at stake every day in her role as team leader at MSI Nepal’s clinic in Pokhara, a city about a three-hour drive from Beni. “It’s a big deal for a woman to come here, it takes guts,” says Karki. “Some communities do not accept family planning and they believe abortion is wrong. Pre-marital sex is not acceptable, so unmarried women are afraid of taking up the service.” Karki says a combination of social stigma, lack of awareness and difficulties accessing family planning services puts women at severe risk. Some turn to “unsafe and unauthorised places for abortion”, says Karki, or attempt to abort themselves using traditional herbs or a sharpened stick. While there is limited accurate and recent data, a study by Crehpa estimated that in 2014 almost 60% of abortions in Nepal were carried out illegally, meaning they took place at unapproved facilities in potentially unsafe conditions. Another study put the figure at 52% in 2021. “The main challenge is they lack awareness of abortion in rural areas. They do not know how to access proper services,” says Karki. “Many are not even aware that abortion is legal.” That challenge is only likely to grow under a second Trump presidency, but that does not seem to concern Rai. Although he says he does explain the law in his talks, he adds that if Nepali women do not know that abortion is legal, “that is good news for me”. Asked if he would prefer Donald Trump to win the election, Rai replies, “Of course.”","2024-10-21T04:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/oct/21/anti-abortion-us-global-gag-rule-nepal-family-planning-services"

Members of the Polish parliament rejected a bill today that would have decriminalised the act of facilitating abortions, AFP reported. The draft law was rejected by 218 MPs against and 215 in favour. The bill was the first of four draft texts to liberalise abortion access in Poland put forward by members of the ruling coalition. Finnish lawmakers have approved a bill that will allow border guards to turn away third-country migrants attempting to enter Finland from Russia, the Associated Press reported.

Coordinated networks of accounts spreading disinformation “flooded” social media in France, Germany and Italy before the elections to the European parliament, Dutch researchers have found. After an in-depth analysis of disinformation on the platform X in four EU countries, the researchers concluded that many of the accounts had been set up after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but were cranked up in the weeks and days before the vote, with growth in their numbers of followers rocketing. “The impact of these accounts is increasing at an alarming rate,” said Trollrensics, a specialist consultancy commissioned by the Dutch Socialist and Democratic parties in the European parliament. “We can conclude with absolute certainty that a large coordinated network of accounts was influencing the EU elections in Germany, France and Italy.” Read the full story here.

It (such behaviour) does not make an American head of state look good,” said Peskov. Gitanas Nausėda, the Lithuanian president, has thanked Joe Biden “for a warm welcome in the United States of America &amp; excellent organization of the NATO summit.” The French Green leader, Marine Tondelier, has said the risk of the far right rising to power in France has not disappeared after the snap election, and politics must urgently change to regain voters’ trust. “It was a warning,” Tondelier said of this month’s election, where a spectacular rush of tactical voting in the final round held back Marine Le Pen’s far-right, anti-immigration National Rally. The RN’s first-round surge had brought it the closest it had ever been to a parliament majority and entering government. “The Republic held on, but for how much longer?” Tondelier said in an interview in her Paris office, days after a left alliance including her Green party finished ahead in the election in a surprise result. Talks are now under way over what type of government France could form and Tondelier, a 37-year-old environmentalist, is among names being suggested for prime minister – a prospect she has not commented on, saying policy is more important than personalities. Read the full story here. Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders has mocked Joe Biden’s gaffes. “President Putin meets vice-president Trump,” he wrote, posting photos of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Kamala Harris. Yesterday, Biden introduced the Ukrainian president as “president Putin” before correcting himself and saying “we’re going to beat Putin.” The American president also misnamed Harris. “I wouldn’t have picked vice-president Trump to be vice-president, if she’s not qualified to be president,” he said. Meanwhile in France… Gabriel Attal, the caretaker prime minister and an ally of Emmanuel Macron, has formalised his candidacy to lead the Renaissance group in the national assembly. Hungary’s far right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, met with Donald Trump in Florida yesterday. In a post this morning, the Hungarian leader wrote: “We continued the peace mission in Mar-a-Lago. President Donald Trump has proved during his presidency that he is a man of peace. He will do it again!” Four people drowned in the Channel overnight, French maritime police said today, AFP reported. The people drowned off Boulogne-sur-Mer on France’s northern coast while trying to cross to the UK. Maritime police told AFP that a navy patrol boat went to the site after being alerted and that four people taken out of the water by helicopter were dead. Others were rescued alive, the police said. Reuters cited a French coast guard spokesperson as saying that a total of 67 people were aboard the boat and that 63 of them were rescued by an operation involving four ships and one helicopter.

"abortion","Afternoon Update: Harris and Trump’s closing arguments; Dutton cracks whip on abortion; and a rival to Moo Deng","Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. As polls in the final hours of the US election indicate an extremely close contest, both presidential candidates have held duelling rallies in Pennsylvania, making their final pitches in the key swing state. They offered starkly contrasting visions for America’s future: Harris delivered a more positive closing argument, shifting focus away from the ex-president – who gets no mention in her final ad – and insisting “we all have so much more in common than what separates us”. Conversely, Trump rambled through dark and dystopian speeches painting migrants as dangerous criminals while also launching personal attacks on a number of high-profile Democratic women. Meanwhile, podcaster Joe Rogan officially endorsed Trump, citing the influence of “the great and powerful” Elon Musk, who was also granted a legal reprieve today as a US judge rejected an attempt to shut down his $1m voter giveaway scheme. Though the US election might be happening thousands of kilometres away, Peter Lewis explains why Australians shouldn’t be lulled into thinking it’s “just something that happens over there”.

"abortion","Louisiana descends into dystopia with historic law on abortion pills","There’s something rotten in the state of Louisiana Louisiana is not a great place to get pregnant. If you need an abortion, a near-total ban means it’s almost impossible to get one, even in cases of rape or incest – anyone who provides an abortion deemed illegal can go to jail for 15 years. And if you plan on having the baby, you have to deal with some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the US. Although, as Senator Bill Cassidy has helpfully noted, “if you correct our population for race, we’re not as much of an outlier as it’d otherwise appear”. In other words, if you ignore Black people (a third of his constituents), things look a little better. So that’s OK then! This week, Louisiana decided to descend further into dystopia and passed a first-of-its-kind law making abortion pills a controlled substance. Senate Bill 276 makes possession of the abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol without a prescription punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Republicans excel at using sneaky tactics to undermine our rights, and this bill is no exception. When it was originally put forward, you see, the bill didn’t include the amendment that turns abortion pills into Schedule IV drugs – a classification normally given to dangerous or addictive substances. Rather, the bill was positioned as a way to protect pregnant people by making it a crime to intentionally give an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant woman without her consent. Everyone can get behind that idea, right? There was also an emotional story behind the legislation that made it easy to sell. Senator Thomas Pressly, the author of the bill, explained that his sister, Catherine Herring, had been slipped the abortion pill by her soon-to-be-ex-husband. Various outlets have said that Herring then managed to save the baby through a “medical abortion reversal process”. KTBS, for example, a Louisiana media outlet, reported that Herring “used a pill-reversal regimen and her baby is still alive”. I’m sorry … what? I’m not a doctor but this story sounds medically implausible. Sara Pentlicky, who is a doctor (a gynecologist) and an abortion provider, told me much the same thing. “If [Herring] took medication abortion pills and was still pregnant with a baby, the only explanation is that the pills didn’t work, which is a possibility,” Pentlicky said when I ran the scenario past her. There are, however, she notes, organizations that “prescribe progesterone to people who have taken medication abortion pills with the false information that it can reverse the medication abortion”. The New York attorney general is currently cracking down on these organizations, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said the procedures are “unproven and unethical”. They’re also dangerous: a recent study looking at the effects of progesterone on people who had taken mifepristone was halted after “the third hemorrhage”. To be clear, I’m not saying Pressly is lying about what his sister went through: Herring’s husband pleaded guilty to injuring a child and the assault of a pregnant person and was sentenced to six months in jail. But it does rather feel like Pressly has weaponized elements of his sister’s story to position a regressive law as a way to protect women. That’s certainly how it’s being defended following a backlash to the law, anyway. On Friday, for example, Landry tweeted that safety was the motivation behind the bill. “Proud to stand with our legislature to ensure this drug can be obtained legally and safely – ensuring the protection of all women. Without this bill, women and the unborn are more susceptible to predators,” Landry said. Let’s be very clear here: this isn’t about protecting women at all. Rather it’s about making abortion pills even more difficult to access in Louisiana than they already are. More than 200 doctors in Louisiana have signed a letter to lawmakers warning that reclassification could provide a “barrier to physicians’ ease of prescribing appropriate treatment” and cause unnecessary fear and confusion among patients and doctors. Which, of course, is exactly what anti-abortion activists want. Perhaps the most depressing aspect of all this is that it’s almost certain that Louisiana has just set a dangerous new trend. As Pentlicky notes: “Every time a state succeeds in passing any type of abortion restriction, we see other states follow suit – it just becomes more and more egregious.” In short, expect Louisiana’s crackdown on abortion pills to come to a red state near you soon. Texas doctor who said nine-year-olds can safely give birth now on maternal mortality committee Looks like Texas is giving Louisiana a run for its money when it comes to the worst US state to be female. British teacher charged with hate crime for calling Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman ‘coconuts’ Marieha Hussain has been charged with a racially aggravated public order offence for a placard at a pro-Palestinian demonstration poking fun at the British prime minister and former home secretary by depicting them as coconuts. It’s fair to debate whether the term “coconut” (which is used in British ethnic minority communities to mean someone brown outside and white inside) is offensive, but criminalizing a brown woman for using it to criticize two brown politicians who have thrown their weight behind racist policies is outrageous. Let’s not forget that Sunak wants to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, and, during her stint as home secretary, Braverman brought in dystopian anti-protest legislation that has just been ruled unlawful and undemocratic. I can think of a lot worse things to call the pair of them than “coconuts”. This feels a lot like yet another way of punishing pro-Palestinian speech. What does Donald Trump think about birth control? On Tuesday, Trump suggested that he would be open to restricting access to birth control and would have a policy on that “very shortly”. After a lot of alarmed headlines, he announced on Truth Social that: “I DO NOT SUPPORT A BAN ON BIRTH CONTROL.” The all-caps do not make this assurance any more convincing. There’s a new reality TV dating show called ‘Virgin Island’ You will be able to guess from the name exactly what Virgin Island is about. In other abstinence-related news, celibacy is very hot right now. And if a President Trump does outlaw birth control, I imagine it will become even more popular. Epidural in labour can reduce risk of serious complications by 35% A new study suggests expanding access to epidurals, particularly in women who are delivering prematurely, could improve maternal health. Nicola Coughlan shows that you don’t need to sacrifice your morals for success I’ve been delighted to watch the Bridgerton actor (who got her big break in the amazing Derry Girls) go from strength to strength. Unlike a lot of other celebrities, the 37-year-old isn’t a cowardly nepo baby: the self-made actor has consistently spoken out about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza despite being warned that calling for a ceasefire could harm her career. Just take that in for a moment, will you? We live in a world where calling for a ceasefire in the middle of a genocide can hurt your career. Meanwhile, Amy Schumer, the self-proclaimed “most successful female comedian of all time”, has shared outrageously racist statements about Palestinians without facing any career consequences whatsoever.

"abortion","‘It’s kind of whispered in corridors’: women being forced into underground abortion networks in rural NSW, study finds","A small but influential number of medical practitioners who obstruct abortion care or are uninterested in providing it are leaving women unable to access abortion in many parts of rural New South Wales, a study has found. It has led to informal and often underground networks of health workers providing information and access to abortion care to patients, the study found, with these providers burning out due to high demand and attitudes toward them. Dr Anna Noonan, a research fellow at the University of Sydney’s school of rural health, interviewed 16 healthcare providers, including GP registrars, GP obstetricians, nurses, midwives and women’s health nurses asking them about unintended pregnancy. All of the staff worked in the western region of NSW, where 17% of the population is female and of reproductive age (15 to 44 years), and where there is only one publicly advertised abortion service. “We found the decision of one person in a position of power can result in there being no access to an abortion service at all,” Noonan said. “What I ended up hearing from the primary care providers was that they experienced this constant, often passive obstruction by the health system at multiple layers.” For example, doctors training as rural generalists and willing to provide abortion healthcare found the rural clinical hospitals where they did their work placements did not provide abortions. “So they’re learning to provide healthcare without receiving any clinical training or exposure to abortion,” Noonan said. “It meant many felt underprepared and undertrained to provide (surgical abortion) care.” The study – published in the journal Rural and Remote Health – found that one tertiary institution had even requested censorship of education about abortion services during student clinical placements. One health worker told researchers: “The problem is that you do have a number of conscientious objectors in the hierarchy of these larger hospitals … that is going to be super hard to get past, because they’re the people that make the rules.” Most study participants identified professional stigma as a reason why abortion services were limited, hidden and unadvertised. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email One health worker said patients who Googled the name of a gynaecologist providing abortion would not find any information about the service online. “It’s just like this underground service that he provides,” the health worker said. Another study participant described how “it’s kind of whispered in corridors, like – ‘Do you know anyone who does abortions?’” The unwillingness of providers to openly share information even about where medicines to end early pregnancies could be prescribed or dispensed meant some health workers spend considerable clinical time searching for answers, ringing around pharmacies, asking if they stock the medication, and coming up with a plan for the patient. Noonan said those health workers trying to refer patients on to services found it hard to navigate who to call and where to go. Some health workers come up with their own informal, underground workarounds, the study found. A nurse at one rural clinic shared that she would connect patients to an interstate GP who would prescribe medication for abortion via telehealth. Nurse practitioners and midwives are not allowed to prescribe abortion medication in NSW. The nurse then took on all pre- and post-abortion care. “That was working well for two years,” the nurse said, until “we got a new medical director, and he axed it”. Noonan said this kind of workaround was sometimes scrapped because managers believed abortion care should be provided by obstetricians and gynaecologists, and because it was too time-consuming for general health service providers to manage on top of other healthcare. “Australia has taken the most extraordinarily narrow view on abortion, often perceiving it as an obstetrics and gynaecology issue,” Noonan said. “And maybe it is for the really complicated surgical cases, but it isn’t for the routine prescribing of an abortion pill for an under nine-week pregnancy. We are still holding on to this catastrophising of abortion, this exceptionalising of abortion, where abortion is seen as something so specialised that it needs to be managed by a minute population of the health workforce, and it’s a misguided approach.” Evidence from the World Health Organization shows that nurse- and midwife-led abortion care models are safe and effective. Noonan said delays finding a provider of medical abortion might mean a patient reaches beyond nine weeks of pregnancy, leaving surgical abortion the only option, which is also hard to access. The study found that the paucity of GP abortion providers meant existing services were “flooded with requests from other primary healthcare workers trying to find local options, creating tension and overwhelm”. An obstetrician, who did not want to be named due to the attitudes of some colleagues towards abortion, told Guardian Australia that one in four Australian women need an abortion during their reproductive years. The clinician, who is also a spokesperson for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, agreed with Noonan that abortion care should be seen as normal, routine healthcare but often was not. “Abortion care is a high demand service,” she said. “I think another part of the reason health services are reluctant to provide it is because there’s such a chronic shortage of funding for women’s health, and the Medicare rates for providing women’s health are very low. “To do a more complex ultrasound on a woman, you actually get paid less than doing a very simple scrotal ultrasound on a man.” She said some health services feared being overwhelmed by an increase in patient numbers if they were to provide abortion. “For that reason they want to keep abortion care outside of normal care,” she said. “It doesn’t make financial sense to provide it, when women’s health services are so underfunded already.” She said any hospital funded with public money should be working within the full scope of their facilities to provide all women’s health services, including abortion. Greg Johnson is the managing director of MSI Australia, a non-profit advocate and provider of abortion and contraception services. He said while Noonan’s study was small and focused on one region, “the experiences ring true with all of the things that we hear at MSI Australia across rural and regional care”. “Fundamentally, abortion is still at the periphery of an unaccommodating health system,” he said. “Abortion care should be truly seen as an equal and accepted part of healthcare. Until we get there, we’ll continue to have the problems that we currently have, particularly in rural and regional Australia.” Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com","2024-11-04T14:00:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/abortion-access-study-rural-new-south-wales-women"
"abortion","Stevie Nicks releases song inspired by fight for abortion rights: ‘Don’t let them take your power’","Stevie Nicks has released a forthright new single, The Lighthouse, inspired by the fight to reinstate abortion rights in the US. Nicks wrote the robust, swaggering rock song in the aftermath of the June 2022 decision by the US supreme court to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that Americans had a constitutional right to abortion. “It seemed like overnight, people were saying, ‘What can we, as a collective force, do about this?’” Nicks said. “For me, it was to write a song. It took a while because I was on the road. Then early one morning I was watching the news on TV and a certain newscaster said something that felt like she was talking to me – explaining what the loss of Roe v Wade would come to mean. I wrote the song the next morning and recorded it that night. “That was September 6, 2022. I have been working on it ever since. I have often said to myself, ‘This may be the most important thing I ever do. To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters – and the men that love them.’ This is an anthem.” In the song, Nicks casts herself as the titular lighthouse, guiding women to campaign for their rights. “I want to teach them to fight / I want to tell them this has happened before, don’t let it happen again,” she sings. The chorus is similarly a call to action: “They’ll take your soul, take your power, unless you stand up, take it back / Try to see the future and get mad / It’s slipping through your fingers, you don’t have what you had / And you don’t have much time to get it back.” Nicks is backed by Sheryl Crow, who plays guitar and bass as well as singing backing vocals. Crow also co-produced the song with 13-time Grammy winning Dave Cobb. The Lighthouse has been released amid a US election campaign where abortion access has been at the forefront of campaigning. Trump installed the supreme court justices who overturned the decision during Joe Biden’s presidency, and has boasted about it: “After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v Wade,” he said in May. In August he said he had “no regrets” about the court decision, saying: “The federal government should have nothing to do with this issue. It’s being solved at the state level and people are very happy about it.” Kamala Harris has repeatedly criticised Trump on the issue, characterising him earlier this week as “the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they, rightly, should be able to make about their own body and future”. With abortion law now decided at a state level, 14 states have banned abortion with another 11 described as “hostile” to it by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Research published this month by Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health found that doctors are being forced to provide substandard care by making women take unviable pregnancies to full term. Nicks, 76, has been using her music to focus on civil rights struggles in recent years. Her one-off track Show Them the Way, in 2020, was inspired by watching documentaries about the civil rights movement and has Nicks imagining performing at a political benefit attended by Martin Luther King Jr, John Lennon, John F Kennedy and others. She followed it with a cover of Buffalo Springfield’s For What It’s Worth, which was originally inspired by clashes between police and young people over LA curfew laws, and became synonymous with the anti-Vietnam war movement. The Lighthouse is a rare entirely new song for Nicks, whose last album of brand new material was 2011’s In Your Dreams. She followed that with new recordings of earlier demos, 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault, in 2014. She has continued to tour in recent years, including in a co-headline tour with Billy Joel in 2023 and 2024. She will be the musical guest on the 12 October edition of Saturday Night Live, where she is likely to perform The Lighthouse. While her new song certainly rebukes Trumpism, Nicks has not explicitly endorsed Harris. Instead she has called for people to register to vote, and in a recent Instagram post she alluded to Swift’s endorsement of Harris, writing: “As my friend Taylor Swift so eloquently stated, now is the time to research and choose the candidate that speaks to you and your beliefs.” She signed off “childless dog lady” in a nod to Swift’s own characterisation of herself as a “childless cat lady”, JD Vance’s derisive description of US Democrats.","2024-09-27T09:45:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/27/stevie-nicks-song-abortion-rights-the-lighthouse-fleetwood-mac"
"abortion","Coalition senators split in voting on Ralph Babet motion on abortion – as it happened","This is where we’ll wrap up the blog for today – but first, a quick recap: Australia and Indonesia have struck a new security pact that will lead to more joint military exercises and visits, prompting human rights advocates to call for safeguards. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, reiterated her call for a Gaza ceasefire at the outset of a meeting at Parliament House with the visiting prime minister of Qatar. Penny Wong has hit out at narratives of immigrants being a “burden” or “peril” as she accused the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of reviving “divisive” rhetoric about Palestinian refugees. Coalition senators have split when voting on a divisive motion regarding abortion, with a Liberal moderate imploring fellow politicians to “mind the language that we use” because “this is not our playground”. The independent MPs Andrew Wilkie and Rebekha Sharkie released a letter to the prime minister and opposition leader in which they call for a conscience vote on gambling ads. The education minister, Jason Clare, has confirmed universities will learn the government’s plan on capping international student numbers “in the coming week”. The former Labor senator Fatima Payman has reiterated that she does not have “any plans” to form a new political party but her new chief of staff says it is “a discussion we need to have”. Independent Tasmanian senator Tammy Tyrrell has announced she won’t be supporting the government’s NDIS bill when it pops up in the Senate. An environment group has dropped a long-running legal case against Woodside Energy’s proposed Scarborough gas development off Western Australia’s north-west coast. Six environment NGOs have come together to release a “statement of concern” over the lack of regulation for offshore gas and oil companies, particularly when it comes to cleaning up mess from the projects. Coalition senator says Parliament ‘is not our playground’ and ‘the things we do here matter’ amid divisive abortion motion Maria Kovacic, a Liberal senator, told the Senate when it was considering a motion regarding abortion proposed by the UAP’s Ralph Babet: What is critically important in relation to this issue, and any other issues for that matter, that this chamber addresses is that we keep in mind the language that we use, the accuracy of the information that we share and the transparency for the reasons that we share them. This is not our playground. The things that we do here matter. There are also questions as to the accuracy of the information contained in this motion. This is a matter of great sensitivity. There is no question about that. The motion as set out is very black and white. The matters for which it deals with are not. Kovacic told the Senate that the constitution was clear that abortion was a matter for the states, not for the federal parliament: More broadly, the complexity of issues that arise from the contents of this motion are challenging for most people, but particularly for women, and they are deeply personal. They are not decisions that are made either lightly or flippantly, and should not be open to judgment by others. In many cases, these decisions are informed on the basis of medical necessity, and we should think very, very carefully as to the appropriateness of elected representatives making healthcare decisions for Australian women. The Greens senator Larissa Waters told the Senate: I am appalled that once again, we’re here debating women’s choices over their own bodies, choices that are no one else’s to weigh in on. Senator Babet’s claims are incorrect. Late-term abortions resulting in a live foetus are extremely rare, and they only occur in situations of lethal foetal abnormalities or serious risks to the pregnant person. Medical practitioners are already subject to ethical responsibilities that manage those complex situations, and moreover, the vast majority of terminations in Australia occur prior to 16 weeks, at which time a foetus would not survive outside the womb. If you want to prevent unwanted pregnancies, then support the calls by the Greens to make contraception free, but you just want to control women’s bodies. Coalition split over support for failed United Australia motion on abortion Coalition senators have split when voting on a divisive motion regarding abortion, with a Liberal moderate imploring fellow politicians to “mind the language that we use” because “this is not our playground”. Ralph Babet, the United Australia party senator, sought to move an urgency motion on “the need for the Senate to recognise that at least one baby is born alive every seven days following a failed abortion and left to die, and that Australia’s health care system is enabling these inhumane deaths; and for the Senate to condemn this practice, noting that babies born alive as a result of a failed abortion deserve care”. The urgency motion failed to secure adequate support, with 18 voting in favour of Babet’s motion and 32 voting against, but it split the Coalition. Those voting in favour of Babet’s urgency motion included Coalition senators Michaelia Cash, Sarah Henderson, Bridget McKenzie, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Hollie Hughes. Those opposing Babet’s motion included Coalition senators Simon Birmingham, Andrew Bragg, Jane Hume and Maria Kovacic. Babet told the Senate that he could not understand “how we can bang on every single day in this place about the importance of human rights while allowing the most vulnerable human beings to be treated like garbage”. But Kovacic, a Liberal moderate senator, told the Senate that there were “questions as to the accuracy of the information contained in this motion”. Continued in next post. Let’s return to the meeting between the Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, and the prime minister of Qatar, a country that has been playing a key role in attempting to broker a Gaza ceasefire agreement. One of the main items on the agenda was an attempt to deepen trade and economic ties. But developments in the Middle East were also on the agenda, with the Australian side expecting to hear an update on progress on the ceasefire talks. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, who holds the dual roles of prime minister and foreign affairs minister of Qatar, said at the beginning of the meeting that it was a “critical moment” for the region. He said he looked forward to discussing “recent developments in our region, mainly the war in Gaza and also what’s happening on the regional level”. He said: Also, I would like to convey my condolences for the loss of the Australian citizen in the World Central Kitchen incident. Also we want to thank you for all your contribution to the Palestinian cause and to the Palestinian people. It also sounded like he thanked Wong for the resumption of funding for the UN aid agency Unrwa, although the parliamentary division bells were ringing at the same time so one or two words couldn’t be heard clearly. As we reported here earlier, Wong said at the beginning of the meeting that the situation in Gaza was “catastrophic” and the humanitarian situation was “unacceptable” and reiterated Australia’s backing for a ceasefire. PM warns against stereotyping while defending Palestinian visas Anthony Albanese has hit back at the opposition over questions about the visas his government has granted to Palestinians fleeing Gaza since the October 7 attack. Speaking in question time, the prime minister warned against the danger of “stereotyping people because of their race or their faith”, saying “Hamas … are enemies not only of the people of Israel, but also, they are enemies of the Palestinian people”. Defence minister hails Indonesian cooperation on boat arrivals Richard Marles has said there has been an “increase in our cooperation” with Indonesia after being asked if there has been an increase in attempted boat arrivals from the country. The defence minister, speaking on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing a short time ago, said that cooperation could be furthered by a defence agreement negotiated with Indonesia, saying it would provide a “much greater opportunity and ease by which our defence forces can operate together” on boat arrivals. Asked if there has been fewer boat turn backs because Indonesian authorities are doing more at the point of departure, Marles said: I can’t go into the specifics of that. I very much understand your question, though. I think a level of cooperation that we are engaging in, in respect of this, is definitely yielding results for Australia and for Indonesia. My colleague Dan Hurst has more on the security pact here: Children’s commissioner finds evidence of ‘most egregious’ human rights breaches in Australia The national children’s commissioner says interviews with more than 150 young people about their experiences in the criminal justice system have revealed “evidence of the most egregious breaches of human rights in this country”. Commissioner Anne Hollonds released a landmark report on Tuesday, titled Help Way Earlier, which calls for the establishment of a national taskforce to reform child justice systems. It also recommends raising the age of criminal responsibility, a cabinet minister for children, and a ban on the use of solitary confinement. More on this story here: Hello, I’ll now be with you until this evening. Jordyn Beazley will take you through the evening. Politics live will return very early tomorrow morning for the second last sitting day of this sitting. No doubt, it will be more of the same, but we are also waiting on what will happen with the NDIS bill and also the aged care reforms. We’ll bring you all of that as it happens tomorrow – until then, take care of you. In case you haven’t seen it yet: Let’s cut away from the domestic political unhinging for a moment. While the House of Reps question time was still under way, Penny Wong reiterated her call for a Gaza ceasefire at the outset of a meeting at Parliament House with the visiting prime minister of Qatar. Qatar has been playing a key role in attempting to broker a Gaza ceasefire agreement. The media was allowed in for the start of the meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, who holds the dual roles of prime minister and foreign affairs minister of Qatar. Wong told her counterpart: Can I also express publicly our recognition of and our appreciation for the work that your country and you yourself have been playing in the negotiations for a ceasefire. This is a very hard task, but so important for increased humanitarian [access], the return of hostages and a ceasefire to protect civilians … We know the situation in Gaza is catastrophic and the humanitarian situation is unacceptable. Not only the loss of life but we now see the emergence of polio and it makes a ceasefire all the more important. We’ll bring you more details about the meeting a little later. The Greens senator Nick McKim had some advice for the prime minister a little earlier today in the Senate: It was another day of not learning a lot. Less than usual, and that is saying something. It is obvious that the Coalition is intent on continuing to prosecute what it thinks is a winning issue, which is the security arrangements around Palestinian visas. Peter Dutton and his team think national security is one of his strengths and it is an arena the Coalition want to fight the government on. That serves a couple of purposes – it muddies the (political) waters ahead of the government having to make a decision on what to do with the 1,300 or so Palestinians who are in Australia with a ticking clock on their visas (the visas granted only last year). And it means the Coalition sucks up all the political oxygen. Labor’s tactics team seem to have cottoned on to the latter part of the political strategy, with Anthony Albanese repeating the same answer, no matter the question, and then sitting down before the Coalition could drag him into a fight over what he wasn’t saying. What is interesting to note though, is that this is only playing out in the house. There have been no questions on this issue from the Coalition in the Senate for the past two days. Jim Chalmers gets a dixer just so he can say: All we get from those opposite, Mr Speaker, is another day doubling down on divisiveness and diversion. Another day of scaremongering from the leader of the opposition, and another day of silence from the shadow treasurer on the economy. I was thinking a moment ago when Minister Rishworth was talking about Prime Minister Morrison swearing himself in to multiple portfolios. The former government had two Treasury spokespeople. This opposition has none. Mr Speaker, it has none. So it averages out. It averages out, one each. Mr Speaker, either side of the election, one of them is on the dog whistle, the other one is in the doghouse, Mr Speaker. And whenever he plays his little dog whistle, the shadow treasurer rolls over every time he plays his dog whistle, Mr Speaker, he sits there voiceless and clueless on the most important issue that people can face right now. Today in question time, every single question on the Middle East. Not one single question on middle Australia. Not one question about middle Australia. There are a bunch more points of order on imputations on members and then Peter Dutton tries to move that Chalmers no longer be heard. The whole chamber is a big ole mess and then Anthony Albanese calls time, putting everyone out of their misery. Anthony Albanese finishes with: And that doesn’t stop when someone is granted a visa. Our security agencies continue to do their job. That is what they do. Now I’m not, I haven’t been speaking about other things. If I was asked about cost of living, or if I was asked about anything that they seemingly don’t care about, but all they care about is going down this negative road because we know who this bloke is. He shows us from the time he walked into this place and from the time he walked out … Someone has another point of order, but Albanese says he has concluded his answer. The whole chamber is up in arms by the time Dan Tehan tries, once again, to get an answer to this question: My question is to the prime minister. How many of the 2,900 visas from Gaza have been cancelled? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for his question. We’re being guided every step of the way by our security agencies. What our agencies do is to constantly examine issues. That doesn’t stop when someone is granted a visa. The opposition has had enough and wants Milton Dick to rule on whether Albanese is being relevant to the question. Everyone is interjecting and everyone has points of order and everyone is cranky. Albanese eventually returns to the dispatch box and says: Mr Speaker, I’m speaking about the process that happens with the granting of these visas, and that is what I am asked about. And from a group of people who held press conferences and used to say they wouldn’t discuss anything at all about whether there were any visas at all, because this whole area was because of security issues like on border matters. It is unbelievable that they expect that. They expect that. Now when it comes to the granting of a visa, they’re granted in the same way, our security agencies are involved, the same security standards. Dugald tells Peter Dutton to stop interjecting. Bob Katter yells throughout that answer and Dugald tells him there are other areas where he can raise his concerns. Amanda Rishworth, representing Don Farrell, the special minister of state, then takes a dixer: “Why is it important to have rigorous, transparent and fair election processes? And is the minister aware of any examples of groups seeking special treatment outside the rules?” This sets Rishworth up to speak about the NSW local government election nominations shambles. Paul Fletcher is annoyed (more annoyed than usual) and thinks the question and answer are both out of order. Dugald tells him the question is in order and if he had a problem with it, he should have raised it at the time, and not part way through Rishworth’s answer. Jim Chalmers tries to defuse the situation with: I thank my fellow Queenslander for the characteristically colourful question. I think that the house will forgive me for steering well clear of the pagan rituals and the tree gods, and I will spare the house, I will spare the house through a gallop of a couple of thousand years of history. (He then goes through infrastructure spending.) Yesterday Katter continued with: … The six greatest scientists in human history are Pasteur, Newton, Galileo, Einstein, Faraday and Mendel, and all of them were profound Christian believers. Mendel was a monk and Faraday was a preacher of religion. They’re the six greatest scientists in human history. Who destroyed communism? It murdered 78 million people, and who destroyed it? Gorbachev. And his first comment to the world was: “When we go down upon our knees at night we all pray to the same God.” The world that I lived in was different than the world that I was brought up in, with the terror of the atomic bomb threatening us every day of our lives, and it was cured by that great man, Gorbachev, and the Pope of Rome and Charlie Wilson, who were all profound Christians, motivated by Christianity. Who got rid of slavery? We Christians did. Who led the civil rights movement in the United States? We Christians did. I now see it spat upon by this organisation and this organisation being lauded by people in this parliament. Which is where today’s question appears to have come from. Bob Katter asks a question of Jim Chalmers. The chamber holds its breath, as it usually does when Katter goes to speak. They are not let down: Doesn’t the federal government’s backing of the Brisbane Olympics confiscate $30bn off Queensland’s coal and cattle farmers, giving it to the IOC whose Paris opening ceremony was, and I quote: “A pagan ritual denigrating Christianity.” Didn’t Christians abolish slavery, create from a brutal imperium from the Dark Ages the Renaissance? Didn’t communism murder 78 million people? Didn’t Christian Gorbachev, the Pope and the Christians abolish communists? Didn’t pagan rituals sacrifice children to the tree and crocodile gods? Do such rituals still live on, Mr Treasurer? Milton Dick is not sure that pagan rituals is within Chalmers’ portfolios. This is not new from Katter. The Kennedy MP launched into a full-scale Katter attack against the member for Moreton, Graham Perrett, in the federation chamber yesterday, when Perrett did a “rah-rah the Queensland Olympics will be great” speech. Elements of that included Katter yelling at Perrett: The party that I belong to, KAP, tenaciously opposes the Olympic Games. You’ll stay there and listen! Your Olympic Games spat upon Christianity. You spat upon Christianity with the most infantile, puerile, undergraduate … Perrett interjects and Katter responds: Madam Speaker, is he going to shut up or will I shut him up? Perrett tells him to “come over here and try”. Katter explodes: There won’t be any trying. There’ll be medical research for you. Madam Speaker, is he going to shut up and allow me to speak? Well, he’s had the floor up to date, and he doesn’t like me saying that they spat upon Christianity. My friend, you enjoy democracy because the Magna Carta was written by Archbishop Langton. That’s who wrote it. Pax Romana was brought to the world by Constantine because he became a Christian. The most brutal regime on Earth, Rome, was Christianised and civilised, and I think that’s an accurate description. Gordon Reid (the Labor MP for Robertson) asks a dixer of Bill Shorten. Shorten acknowledges Reid in the style of someone who really took a 1980s Toastmasters course on introductions and other forms of small talk to heart: I’d like to thank the saxophone-playing Indonesian-speaking emergency doctor member from Wyong for his very good question. And, though it was his birthday last Friday, he understands that the NDIS is changing lives for the better. Dan Tehan continues his one-man show “Sisyphus’s question” as he again asks Anthony Albanese: Prime minister, how many of the 2,900 visas of people onshore from Gaza have been cancelled? Albanese: I thank the member for his question, but the whole premise of it is wrong. There aren’t 2,900 people onshore. And I’ve said that. If he’d followed that, he would have known, including in earlier questions today. But I am asked about visitor visas and I can tell because of the financial year issue – visitor visas for Ukrainians was 9,027 between February 24 2022 … Tehan is back with a Dr Seuss point of order: Of those who are here onshore, of those 2,900 – that’s what I asked. How many have had their visas cancelled. That is what I asked. How many? Albanese: Less than half of the figure that he used of 2,900 – therefore, the whole premise of the question is simply wrong. Visitor visas from Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis that have also been subject to conflict and control. I mean, Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban. Syria has been in a civil war with parts of it controlled by Isis. And, of course, Iraq as well. Those figures from the 2013-14 financial year to 2022 of visitor visas are 1,991 from Afghanistan, 4,994 people from Iraq, 1,505 from Syria. All granted visitor visas by the former government. All in circumstances where Islamic State was in control of large parts of Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2019. Syria’s been in a civil war since 2012, and the Taliban have been in control of large parts of Afghanistan for that entire period. The Greens MP for Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown, asks Michelle Rowland: Today on the ABC, one the pioneers of online sports betting said in relation to gambling advertisements: “If you want to protect the children, you go ahead with a total ban. If you want to protect bookmaker profits, you go ahead with a partial ban.” Minister, who do you want to protect? That is from this ABC radio RN Breakfast interview with Stewart Kenny this morning. Rowland: I thank the member for her question – and the imputations in it. (There is laughter from the Labor benches at this.) I make it very clear, Mr Speaker … That it’s taken a Labor government to not only embark on the most thorough review of an area in need, overdue need for reform, than any other government. But it is also a Labor government that is standing up to a number of very well-resourced vested interests who do not want change. This is a government that is being consultative, evidence-based, and committed to three things. Firstly to ensure that we break the normalisation between gambling and sport. Secondly that we protect children. Thirdly that we focus on the saturation of ads and the fact that they are targeted at one of the most vulnerable cohorts in Australia – namely young men aged 18 to 35. We are doing that, Mr Speaker, in an orderly, consultative manner. We are doing this in a way that is evidence-based. And the member, I am happy to stand corrected, has never sought a briefing on this matter directly with me. But my door is always open. Dan Tehan returns to the dispatch box with a question for the prime minister. How many of the 2,900 visas from Gaza have been cancelled. Anthony Albanese: We’ve been guided every single step of the way by our security agencies. Anyone who has been given a visa has passed the same security standard. And what our agencies do and the member might know this – I suspect – is constantly examine issues. That doesn’t stop when someone is granted a visa. Our security agencies continue to do their job. This is an ongoing process. That is what they do. Regardless of where people are coming from, and the circumstances, their priority is security. There is an attempt at a point of order, but the prime minister has once again decided he has concluded his answer. Andrew Hastie refers to the defence minister, Richard Marles, as “Happy Gilmore” in a point of order, which is a reference to Marles’ love of golf. But Happy Gilmore was an anti-establishment washed-up hockey player, who won over the golfing world, beat the establishment’s Shooter McGavin, made the ball go into its home, saved his grandmother’s house and got the girl. I beg of these people to please watch a movie before using one of the references. Dan Tehan is back! Prime minister, how many of the 2,900 visas from Gaza have been cancelled? (A reminder that just under 1,300 Palestinians made it to Australia before Israel completely closed the Rafah border on the Gaza side in May.) Anthony Albanese: I refer him to my previous answers. We have rejected more than 7,000 visa applications. Fewer than 1,300 people are here. I remind the member that the Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities, and it closed in May. They’re not letting people out. And they could have asked a question about the cost of living, could have asked a question about the visit about … the president-elect visit … There is a point of order on relevance (of course there is. Tveeder transcribes “guidance” as “violence”, which feels apt.) Peter Dutton: Mr Speaker, on relevance and following your earlier [guidance]. That is as tight as that question could possibly be. And yet the prime minister still refuses to give a straight answer. The prime minister, though, has concluded his answer. Tony Burke gets up to point out one of the government’s bugbears – that the opposition uses points of orders to make some sort of glib one-liner. Which Labor also used to do, but the Coalition didn’t make a thing of (or didn’t understand it was against the standing orders. Burke is across more of the practice than most, although Paul Fletcher does his best). Dugald makes a ruling: The way we’ll do this is when someone is on their point on either side, there’s no point getting up until this person has concluded. If you wish to further debate the point of order, that’s OK. But this collision at the dispatch box has got to stop. He tells the opposition he can’t make the PM give a figure and that is not the point of a point of order on relevance. Then he tells the PM to make sure he is relevant. (To the question. Existentially – that is up to the prime minister.) Albanese: Last Wednesday, the leader of the opposition said: “I don’t think that people should be coming in from that war zone at all. At the moment, it’s not prudent to do so and I think it puts our national security at risk.” That’s what he said last Wednesday in welcoming Olympians home. The fact is that came three months after there was a shutting of the Rafah border crossing, which occurred in May. The Liberal MP for O’Connor, Rick Wilson, is the next to suffer the wrath of Dugald, and is booted out under 94A for interjecting just as Dan Tehan is about to get the call. Wilson was heckling Labor, not Tehan, but he forgot the number one rule of QT interjections; choose your moment (and that moment is not when things are quiet). Tehan: Prime minister, of those granted a visa to come to Australia from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone, how many have had their visas cancelled since the horrific attack on Israel on October 7 last year? Albanese: The member for Wannon uses a couple of [points] in his question. One is, quite rightly, to speak about October 7. And there’s no question that certainly, anyone of any decency opposes the atrocity that Hamas committed on October 7. But he also speaks about the terrorist-controlled Gaza Strip. And Hamas did not take control of Gaza on October 7. They took control almost two decades ago, and in that time, have refused to have any elections or any democratic process or to engage with the people of Gaza. And, of course, they certainly don’t represent either the people of the West Bank. The member knows that we take the same advice from the same security agencies. Tehan has a point of order on relevance: The question was very tight, very specific. It was: “How many have had their visas cancelled since the horrific attack in Israel?” So a very, very specific question, it was. (All points of orders should be delivered in Dr Seuss format.) Helen Haines has the first of the crossbench questions and it is to Catherine King. Haines asks: Round one of the Growing Regions program opened for applications in July last year. Successful projects weren’t announced until May this year. We’re now in August and successful applicants are still waiting for their funding so they can get shovels in the ground. Why are regional communities waiting this long for much-needed funding under your government? King begins by speaking about how the pair both have a caravan as a mobile office that they use to travel their electorates with. King’s is a 1970s Franklin. She thinks Haines has a newer one than that. Everyone is very enthralled. To the answer: It is normal practice for the Australian government programs to require a funding agreement to be in with agreement for milestones before payments are made, as this is a financial management system and helps ensure delivery success. For the first time, of course, all communities, whether they be in our regions or our suburbs, will have access to an open and competitive community infrastructure program. We’ve done away with what those opposite did, having a community development grants program where no one was able to apply for funding, and the Coalition simply decided where they were going to actually deliver. Now, I don’t make any apologies for cleaning up the mess of what those opposite left. (There is the obligatory mention of sports rorts and then the three minutes is up.) Before we get to the next dixer (government question to government minister, often written by the government minister’s staff) Milton Dick shows he is not playing today. He is Dugald today, and Dugald is not, as the kids say, demure or mindful. Dugald kicks out the LNP MP for Fisher, Andrew Wallace, and tells the house it is under a general warning. Which is Dugald speak for: try me and see. Anthony Albanese: I note, as I did yesterday, that under the former government, of which he was a member, but not a minister, there were over 1,000 visas, tourist visas granted from the former government for people from the occupied Palestinian territories. The leader of the opposition’s response to that, of course, is that that was before October 7. But the member for Berowra knows full well that Hamas didn’t become terrorists on October 7. They have had a terrorist ideology for a long period of time. And indeed, have been in charge of Gaza since 2006 when they received less than half of the vote from the people of Gaza in that election. And they haven’t had one since, because they are enemies, not only of the people of Israel, but also, they are enemies of the Palestinian people. Because Hamas do not respect the human rights of Palestinian people after they seized control there. They engaged in violence against their own people in Gaza in order to secure their position. They’ve continued to do that. They’ve continued to do that. I did see a report today from Plestia Alaqad who spoke about her personal journey, and I know that the member for Berowra does respect human rights and people, and has a record of it. She went on to say this in her article today: Every person who fled Gaza after October underwent rigorous checks by both the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The idea that those who successfully passed these screenings and arrived in Australia still pose a threat is unfounded and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating those who made it to safety here. The member for Berowra knows, as do other members this chamber know, the danger in stereotyping people because of their race or their faith. People know that that is certainly not the case, and people from Gaza or the West Bank for that matter are certainly not automatically Hamas supporters and shouldn’t be seen … (There is another attempt at a point of order, but Albanese again sits down and says he has concluded his answer.) Opposition continues to ask questions about Gaza visas Back in the house and Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on Australia’s relationship with Indonesia and everyone, including Peter Dutton agrees it is wonderful. Julian Leeser then asks: Today it was reported that before approving visas for people coming from the terrorist-controlled Gaza war zone, Canada requires applicants to submit to face-to-face interviews and biometric testing in a third country – Egypt. Why didn’t the government have a similar arrangement in place before granting more than 2,900 tourist visas? (It was reported because the opposition provided visa numbers to The Australian newspaper, which led to the story. The last election held in Gaza was in 2006. About 44% of the then voting age population voted for Hamas, while about 41% voted for Fatah. Just under 50% of the Gazan population is under 18 and would not have voted in the 2006 election.) Victoria’s ambulance chief resigns amid industrial dispute Stepping outside the parliament for a moment: The chief executive of Ambulance Victoria has resigned amid an industrial dispute. In a statement, Ambulance Victoria said Jane Miller had decided to resign from her position to pursue a new opportunity within the Victorian health sector. The Ambulance Victoria Board today acknowledged Ms Miller’s tireless dedication to the health of all Victorians, and the experience and leadership she has brought to the role since joining in January 2023. Ambulance Victoria said the former emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, had been appointed interim chief executive for six months during the recruitment process. There were a bunch of interjections during that answer and it looked like there was going to be a point of order, but Anthony Albanese decides he has concluded his answer (which means no point of order). It is competing with the DNC, but question time begins in the house and the Senate. Peter Dutton opens up the house questions: Processing a visa application while somebody is offshore in a third country like Jordan means a person can be stopped before getting to Australia. The last government used this process when bringing those people from Syria. The prime minister says the process for granting 2,900 tourist visas to those coming from the terrorist-controlled Gaza zone follow the same process. Can the prime minister advise in which third party country these people were sent to for screening before they came to Australia? Anthony Albanese responds: No matter where a person comes from or what visa they hold, security agencies are involved in the process. They trust their expertise. They take the same advice from the same security agencies, even the same security personnel as the previous government. In this case, we’ve rejected more than 7,000 visa applications – fewer than 1,300 people are here. And I remind the leader of the opposition that the Rafah border crossing is controlled by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. Let’s be clear about what is happening here. Israel closed the Rafah border crossing in May. They’re not letting people out. Three months later, the leader of the opposition decided to call for a ban on Gazans coming to Australia, even though no one is. Efforts to deal with IV fluid shortage should comfort patients, AMA says There is growing reassurance for patients that their care won’t be affected by the IV fluids shortage thanks to the recent coordination across governments, the peak body for doctors says. On Friday the government announced it would be stepping in to coordinate the distribution of IV fluids across the country following a meeting of federal, state and territory health ministers: The Australian Medical Association’s president, Prof Steve Robson, has made a statement today saying the coordination efforts “should be comforting for Australian patients, no matter where they live, or where they are being treated”. The cross-jurisdictional response group established by Minister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler is meeting frequently to share data; co-ordinate action on IV fluid usage and supply; establish forecasts for future needs; discuss logistics and issue clinical guidance and updates to our front-line healthcare workers. Robson said most IV fluids used in Australia are produced locally and the AMA had been advised that the local producer was continuing to operate at full capacity – working to “meet the regular demand in orders from public and private hospitals”. Responsible and measured steps are being taken to conserve supply when necessary and we are now seeing real coordination of efforts to ensure that we not only have enough supply, but it also gets to where it is needed. We also recognise that some practices, including general practices, might be facing short term disruptions. I want to assure those practices that governments are working to address these disruptions quickly. The AMA will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide feedback through the cross jurisdictional working group that we are part of – ensuing that clinician feedback continues to inform decisions being taken at the highest levels. Coalition says it’s in ‘good faith negotiations’ with Labor on aged care The shadow aged care minister, Anne Ruston, has commented on suggestions in Labor caucus that the opposition is close to a deal on aged care reforms, after the government dropped its proposal for criminal penalties for directors for sub-standard care. Ruston said: We are in good faith negotiations with the government and we have fought hard against the inclusion of criminal penalties in the new Aged Care Act. Our position on criminal penalties has always been clear. This was not a recommendation of the royal commission. It was an ill-considered and unconsulted election promise from Labor that would have dangerous consequences. Following significant consultation with the aged care sector, it is clear to the Coalition that this measure would force the exit of highly capable staff from the sector in fear of being criminally punished at a level not seen in any other industry. In the middle of a severe workforce crisis, this is an unacceptable risk. The threat of jail time is the last thing aged care workers and volunteers need as they work hard to care for older Australians amongst significant challenges. There is just under 20 minutes until the next question time (aren’t we lucky) so prepare yourself. It is most likely going to be a copy and paste of what we saw yesterday (and last week). Grab what you need to get through it and we will see you back here at 2ish. The independent MPs Andrew Wilkie and Rebekha Sharkie have released a letter to the prime minister and opposition leader in which they call for a conscience vote on gambling ads. Sharkie told reporters in Canberra that gambling is an issue of “faith and morality” and the call for a free vote “will sit well with many Labor MPs” who face being “banished” from their party if they cross the floor. Wilkie said that “numerous backbenchers are very uncomfortable” with the direction of government reforms to cap gambling ads at two an hour in general programming, a partial rather than total ban. Wilkie said this would still see ads present during times that children are watching TV, accusing the government of prioritising the financial viability of media companies over the safety of children. The government claims it wants a balanced package to avoid unintended consequences, including loss of revenue by media companies and gambling going offshore via the internet. Sharkie accused the government of echoing “talking points” from gambling companies. Disability body calls for senators to vote against government’s NDIS changes The First Peoples Disability Network (FPDN) has called on senators to vote against the government’s NDIS changes. Worimi man and FPDN chief executive Damian Griffis said the FPDN is a human rights-based disability representative organisation and it had a “moral obligation to let our community know their rights are being compromised”. The NDIS has overwhelmingly failed First Nations people, especially those in regional and remote areas. To endorse the bill in its current state is even worse than to accept the status quo, and will see to the introduction of wide sweeping, paternalistic and punitive powers that evidence and history tells us will disproportionately impact the lives of First Nations communities. It is not politics, but people can’t seem to get enough of this story, so here is an update for you: Robbery and serious crime squad detectives have charged a second man with allegedly stealing tens of thousands of unreleased limited edition Bluey coins from a warehouse in Sydney’s west last month. This follows this story from earlier in the month. Strike force detectives, with assistance from Raptor squad (who names these things) arrested a 44-year-old man earlier this morning, after further investigations. Investigations under Strike Force Bandit continue. (We have not confirmed whether the name of the strike force is deliberately Bluey themed.) Pre-election enrolment ‘has never been higher’, AEC says The Australian Electoral Commission has reported the latest electoral roll figures and it seems everyone is champing at the bit to vote, with the AEC reporting that “pre-election enrolment has never been higher”. Some tidbits: 97.9% of all eligible Australians are enrolled to vote (as at 30 June 2024). This is higher than the 96.2% leading into the previous federal election in 2022 (as at 30 June 2021) 96.8% was recorded at the close of rolls for the 2022 federal election (previous record high for a federal election, likely to be eclipsed in 2024/25) An estimated 92.9% of Indigenous Australians are enrolled to vote (as at 30 June 2024). This is significantly higher than the 79.3% leading into the 2022 federal election (as at 30 June 2021). The RBA have released their minutes from their previous meeting: We already know the outcome – the bank board held rates steady. But the minutes reveal they were looking at the unemployment rate and considering what would happen if it suddenly increased. “While the evidence that this was occurring seemed limited, members were alert to the possibility that labour demand could soften, perhaps quite rapidly.” Palestinian visas dominate Coalition party room discussions The Coalition held its joint party room this morning and discussions focused heavily on Labor and the independents’ response to its proposed policy to pause humanitarian visas to those trying to flee Gaza. A party spokesperson said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the next federal election will be a “test of character” and that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had committed a “cardinal sin” for allegedly misquoting the head of Asio, Mike Burgess. Dutton told Coalition members there was concern Labor had “subverted” the usual security checking process and made Australia more unsafe. Last week, Burgess assured Australians the proper checks were being done and that Asio was called to conduct more rigorous checks when required. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, praised Dutton for offering “reasonable solutions” and said the teal independents, who said the policy by Dutton and the opposition was “racist”, had acted disgracefully. Coalition members also raised concerns that some Labor members had been “stirring up division” by criticising the opposition’s track record on multiculturalism. The MPs reiterated the Coalition should stand up for their record. The deputy leader, Sussan Ley, reminded the party room there are Palestinians already in Australia who are deserving of “our welcome and our support” but that does not preclude criticism of the visa process. (Ley had been a member of the Parliamentary friends of Palestine). Greens MP says EPA decision not to tighten soil fill regulations ‘baffling’ The New South Wales Greens MP Sue Higginson says it is “baffling” that the state’s Environment Protection Authority (EPA) cancelled its plans to tighten regulations on a type of cheap, recycled landscaping product after the then Coalition government was warned about it. After obtaining documents under freedom of information laws, Guardian Australia revealed the EPA told senior ministers Matt Kean and Mark Speakman in 2021 that the soil fill – known as recovered fines – posed “potentially unacceptable risks to the environment and the community”. At the time the EPA was proposing to tighten regulation of the products but in May 2022 it walked away from the reforms after opposition from the waste industry. After the publication of Guardian Australia’s story this morning, Higginson said: Something happened between the end of 2021 and mid-2022 that allowed hazardous materials to continue to be sold and distributed by producers of recovered fines from waste. The [EPA’s] reviews in 2013, 2019 and 2020 all proved that the product was dangerous – but no one acted to stop it. This is a toxic legacy that needs to be explained and fixed. Three years later there is still asbestos and other contaminants being sold at garden supply stores and being spread over playgrounds. Regis Resources share price up Taking a look at some of the news floating around today, we decided to see how Regis Resources was faring. Regis sent a scathing statement to the ASX following Tanya Plibersek’s decision to make a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. The declaration is designed to protect the headwaters of the Belubula River on Kings Plains, which was the proposed site of a tailings dam for the company’s McPhillamys goldmine. Regis said the partial declaration made the project “unviable”. We just had a look at the ASX and Regis Resources has seen it’s share price increase today – as of 12.29pm, it was up 3.41%. After the joint statement between the leaders where no questions were allowed to be asked, the government has released joint-ministerial statement on Australia-Indonesia defence cooperation which doesn’t actually say anything about what is happening with the pact, beyond that it will be aimed at “strengthening the bilateral defence relationship across many dimensions and areas of cooperation”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, addressed Labor caucus discussing the four focuses of the government: cost of living, Medicare, Future Made in Australia, and Australia’s place in the world. Albanese referred to Peter Dutton’s history of finding ways to divide Australians, repeating his argument from question time on Monday that the Coalition’s recent concern about Palestinians arriving from Gaza implied that Hamas control was only a problem after the 7 October attacks. While Dutton is obsessed with appearing tough, Labor is focused on those doing it tough, he argued. Albanese noted the Coalition had not produced a single fully costed cost-of-living policy. Albanese also referred to “constructive, detailed” negotiations with the opposition on aged care reforms. He is hopeful of an agreement with the opposition “very soon”. Anika Wells gave details of the new support at home program, and gave the outline of negotiations on taskforce recommendations about viability and investability of residential care. Guardian Australia has confirmed Labor has offered to drop criminal penalties against aged care directors for breaches of standards; and is hoping to introduce more user-pays for wealthier consumers of residential accommodation and food. Caucus also approved legislation: Setting up the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission Paying super on paid parental leave Family law changes, so courts can better consider the effect of family violence Bill Shorten’s amendments to NDIS legislation, reflecting negotiations with premiers on NDIS rule changes, and opposition amendments about not spending on drugs and alcohol Indonesian president-elect says defence pact will be signed in coming days Prabowo Subianto, who is currently the defence minister in Indonesia (as well as being president-elect), said Australia and Indonesia have also concluded negotiations on an updated defence pact, which will be signed in Indonesia in the coming days. I look forward to hosting [Richard Marles] very soon in Indonesia signed our defence cooperation agreements. I think we had very important discussions which I think will be beneficial to both our countries in the future. The defence minister, Richard Marles, also spoke at the joint statement and he too is very excited about the pact. When you consider the journeys of Indonesia and Australia over the decades, it is profoundly historic that we have reached this moment where we find security in each other. The map really determines that Australia and Indonesia is the closest of neighbours and have a shared destiny but, from this moment forth, that destiny is very much defined by deep strategic trust. Typically, it would take the better part of a decade to negotiate an agreement of this kind that we have done it in less than two years, it speaks to the shared ambition, the shared sense of purpose between our two countries, the closeness between Australia and Indonesia under President Widodo and Prime Minister Albanese. I have been to Indonesia in the last 18 months three times, Prabowo Subianto has been here twice, we have met each other countless times in other parts of the world. This would not have happened but [for] Prabowo Subianto’s leadership and I would like to thank him for that leadership. I would like to thank him for his partnership and indeed his friendship. Prabowo Subianto says Indonesia would like Australian help battling ‘narcotics threat’ Prabowo Subianto said he and Anthony Albanese spoke of areas where Indonesia would like “Australian help, advice and assistance”, naming “in the field of agriculture, food security, also in the serious problem of drugs, narcotics, let us say threats that we are experiencing in Indonesia”. I view the drugs problem and the narcotics threat to be of the highest importance in Indonesia and I really value Australian help in this. So we look forward to a wide spectrum of future cooperation, not least in the field of sports. I congratulate Australia for its great achievement in the last Olympics and I am also determined to better our position in the next Olympics. President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who will be inaugurated as president in October, said Anthony Albanese was the first foreign leader to call and congratulate him on his win in February. He too has re-affirmed the relationship between the two countries and will “continue the general policies” of his predecessor. In most fields, especially in the field of economics, we have had good cooperation. We would like to see more Australian participation in our economy. We would also like to see closer collaboration and consultation on various fields that we can achieve outcomes that respect both our economic interests, both our national interests. Albanese says there is ‘no more important relationship’ for Australia than its friendship with Indonesia Anthony Albanese is speaking at the joint press statement he and the Indonesian president-elect Prabowo Subianto are holding. There will be no questions, so it is literally a statement. Albanese: There is no more important relationship than the one between our two great nations. The strides that President Widodo and I have made together toward a deeper economic relationship will be the foundation of the work that I know will continue under your administration and that’s been confirmed by the one-on-one leaders’ meeting that we had today, but also the discussions that we had with senior members of my cabinet and your delegation. Our countries will continue to strengthen our ties as economic partners, security partners and partners that stand ready to benefit from the global transition to net zero. Paul Karp is at the Labor caucus briefing (each party holds a background briefing following its meetings) and says the caucus heard from Anthony Albanese and Anika Wells on the aged care reforms. The prime minister said he was hopeful of an agreement with the opposition “very soon”. Wells gave details of the new support at home program, and gave an outline of negotiations on taskforce recommendations about the financial viability of residential care. One of those things may be making people who have more money pay more for aged care. More to come. Tammy Tyrrell to vote against government’s NDIS bill Independent Tasmanian senator Tammy Tyrrell has announced she won’t be supporting the government’s NDIS bill when it pops up in the Senate: I’m voting against the government’s NDIS bill. There are so many unknowns in this bill. It’s like a book with chapter headings and then no writing. The Senate shouldn’t pass bills that the government couldn’t be bothered to do their homework on. I never wanted to be a politician but, as an accidental one, my goal is to try and make things better for people where I can. Hundreds of Tasmanians on the NDIS are telling me this bill will actually make things worse for them. That’s why I can’t support it. Study shows 24% of Australian children live in ‘childcare desert’ Victoria University has released data showing 700,000 Australians live in areas which make accessing childcare almost impossible. It won’t come as a surprise to anyone living outside of inner city areas, but the research found that roughly 24% of Australian children live in what the researchers termed the “childcare desert”. The Parenthood’s Georgie Dent, who has been pushing for changes to access and the end to the activity test (which bases how much subsidy a parent or care giver can receive based on their “activity” such as work or volunteering), said the government also needed to look at availability of childcare in its quest to expand access. Maddy Butler, the lead campaigner for the Parenthood’s “access for every child” rural coalition said: We know that there is a direct link between access to early childhood education and care and parents’ workforce participation and, in the regions, entire workforces and communities are suffering because of this. This report is yet more proof that as long as providers make the decisions about where to open centres, services will continue to congregate in wealthier, more advantaged and metropolitan areas. Greens’ party room meets The Greens’ party room has met, mainly discussing the lack of progress on a lot of government legislation. The minor party thinks that the NDIS bill may pass on Thursday with opposition support, but otherwise bills are backing up for the September session. A regional broadcasting bill which the Greens planned to amend to push for a total gambling ad ban has been pushed down the list. The Greens are upset about Peter Dutton’s comments on Palestinian visas and are worried Labor will be spooked out of offering a special humanitarian visa to help people fleeing the Gaza war zone. The Greens rejected claims about construction union donations, noting that they hadn’t taken a cent from them in over a decade. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is due to meet later today with the visiting prime minister of Qatar, a country that has been playing a key role in attempting to broker a Gaza ceasefire agreement. The meeting in Canberra is scheduled to occur this afternoon. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, who holds the dual roles of prime minister and foreign affairs minister of Qatar, is visiting Australia and New Zealand. The latest round of Gaza ceasefire talks were held in Doha, Qatar, last week but ended without a breakthrough. Further negotiations are expected to be held in Cairo, Egypt. During a visit to Israel yesterday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that this week was “probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a ceasefire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security”. The Australian government has strongly backed the ceasefire proposal that the US president, Joe Biden, has been pushing for the past three months. Wong has called for “all parties” - meaning Hamas and Israel - to agree to the terms. Wong said in June: The human suffering in Gaza is unacceptable. This war must end James Paterson then asked: But how could you possibly do all the necessary security and other checks in just an hour for an applicant? That’s lightning-speed approval. Michael Willard replied: When we apply that vast range of information to consideration of visitor visas, if you look globally, a very large number of our visitor visas would be done inside an hour. The assessment is essentially looking at all the information we hold and applying it in a number of ways to the application in front of us. You can find that transcript, here Have visas actually been approved in one hour? We have looked for the source of the reports of visas being approved “in some cases as fast as one hour” and one of the official first mentions we can find of it was during a February Senate estimates hearing. During the legal and constitutional affairs estimates hearing, the Liberal senator James Paterson asked a deputy director with the immigration department, Michael Willard, about some reports he had heard. Paterson: There’s been some controversy about this in the media, and the minister for foreign affairs, among others, has reassured the public that no processes were expedited, no corners were cut—all the usual processes were followed. But there was also a media report by the ABC on 9 December, entitled ‘Australians turn to WhatsApp group for help to get family members out of Gaza’, in which some individuals claimed their visitor visas for relatives were approved within one hour. Does that sound right to you? Is it possible that a visitor visa was approved in a single hour? Willard answered: It is possible. I’d make this point in terms of the way we assess a visitor visa: we draw on a vast range of information that we hold, and we apply that information to the circumstances presented in a visitor visa application. There could be circumstances where someone, for example, has a strong travel record, is well known to us and has a routine that we’re familiar with, where the visitor visa could be granted in that time frame. Birmingham says Albanese government handling visas with ‘confusion and chaos’ That led to this question in the same interview: Q: Independent senator David Pocock says Gazans already in Australia should be placed on humanitarian visas. Do you support that call? Simon Birmingham: Well, I’m concerned because we’ve seen yet more of the typical chaos and dysfunction in the Albanese government with the reports that some of those who were processed for visitor visas and processed in some cases as fast as one hour, have arrived in Australia, and then there has been an on again, off again situation with those visas, with cancellations that have occurred, some subsequently reinstated. There is a lot of confusion and chaos underpinning the way in which the Albanese government has handled this now. No doubt there may be some individuals, ultimately who do resettle permanently in Australia, and I trust that all appropriate steps would be taken with them as with anybody in similar circumstances. (The answer went on to reiterate the points about “chaos and confusion”) Simon Birmingham was one of the Liberals who went out this morning to talk about the figures the opposition provided for that story in The Australian. He spoke to Sky News to reiterate the point, but he also danced around a couple of issues he was directly asked about. Q: You spoke of the suffering and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Australia is a compassionate country. Figures show we are accepting more Palestinian refugees than other countries. Considering the dire situation you’ve been talking about, many would see that as a good thing? Birmingham: Well, Australia is a generous country, and we are historically one of the most generous countries in the world, accepting more refugees for permanent resettlement on a per capita basis than almost any other country in the world. And that is something we should have a proud record of. Of course, it’s also a terrible fact that across the world there are many, many more refugees than can ever be resettled. And we face crises in our own region in Myanmar at present, of course, multiple crises in Africa, the continued war in Ukraine. There are sadly no shortage of refugees who would love the opportunity to come to Australia. That’s why we need to make sure for our own social cohesion, wellbeing and security, that every possible security check is applied so that we have confidence that those who come to Australia are not only the most needy, but also the people who will contribute to our country and pose no security threat or risk to the social cohesion of our nation. Opposition provides visa figures from around the world for story in The Australian – but are they complete? The opposition provided figures to The Australian newspaper on the number of visas “likeminded” countries have provided to Palestinians since 7 October, for a story criticising Australia for issuing more. Australia has issued 2,900 visas, but only about 1,300 people arrived in Australia before Israel seized the Rafah border closing and completely closed it. The opposition figures from The Australian include: “The UK has issued 168 protection visas to Palestinians since October 7 but it’s unclear how many have entered the country on other visa classes since October last year. New Zealand has accepted 153 Palestinians for temporary and residence visas and is prioritising applications for those with family in New Zealand. “Canada’s Immigration Minister Marc Miller said in June that just 254 Palestinians had received temporary visas and 41 had received family program visas, while almost 3000 applications were still being processed. While Canada has expanded its cap on extended family visas for Palestinians from 1000 to 5000, it requires applicants to submit to face-to-face interviews and biometric testing in Cairo.” But behind the scenes, the government is pointing to the gaps in the figures – that it is “unclear” how many people came into countries on different visa streams. The education minister, Jason Clare, has spoken at the AFR education summit (the Fin hosts a number of summits across a range of sectors) and confirmed universities will learn the government’s plan on capping international student numbers “in the coming week”. You have heard me speak, I am sure, a lot over the years, about the importance of international education. Not just to our universities, but to our country. How it is the biggest export we don’t dig out of the ground. How it makes us money, and it makes us friends. That hasn’t changed. But a lot has changed over the last two years. Two years ago there were 521,831 international student enrolments in Australia. Today there are 810,960. Clare said that there were about 10% more international students in Australian universities than before the pandemic shut downs and 50% more in vocational education and training courses. That growth has also brought back the shonks looking to make a quick buck. It has lured people who really are here to work, not study. And it’s put the reputation of this industry under pressure. That’s a fact. It has also resulted in Ministerial Direction 107. If you work in international education you will know the impact that has had. Some universities have benefited from it. But some have been hit hard. It’s why a lot of universities have asked me to act to put more sustainable arrangements in place. I know universities and other international education providers are craving detail. That detail will be provided to universities in the coming week. Albanese meets with Indonesian president-elect The meeting between Indonesian president-elect Prabowo Subianto and Anthony Albanese is about to happen. Prabowo will be greeted in the prime minister’s courtyard and sign the visitor’s book. The meeting will be held after that and then there will be a joint press statement – which is a joint non-press conference (there are no questions). There will be a Royal Australian Air Force F-35A conducting a flypast (at about 10.45am), so if you are in Canberra and seeing low flying planes, that is why. Watt outlines minister’s role in CFMEU administration legislation Just before heading into caucus, Murray Watt held a doorstop on the CFMEU administration legislation. The workplace relations minister outlined his role moving forward: The way the legislation is drafted is that it allows me, as the minister, to determine whether it’s in the public interest to put the union’s construction division into administration. And then it’s actually the Fair Work Commission general manager who would appoint the administrator under the legislation. Putting that all together, I’d certainly be hopeful that we can have this process under way by the end of the month. We’ve moved quickly to get this legislation passed and we want to keep moving quickly to get this administration process under way. Six environment NGOs have come together to release a “statement of concern” over the lack of regulation for offshore gas and oil companies, particularly when it comes to cleaning up the mess from the projects. The Maritime Union joined the Wilderness Society, the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Friends of the Earth Melbourne, the Environment Centre Northern Territory and the Conservation Council Western Australia in launching the statement, titled “The failing regulation of the offshore oil and gas industry clean up in Australia”. The groups say the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) is not doing enough to manage the industry clean up. Fern Cadman from the Wilderness Society said regulation failures to ensure offshore oil and gas companies cleaned up their disused and decaying structures was threatening the marine environment. Rusty and decaying wells, pipelines and platforms can rupture, leak and decay, causing chemicals including oil, gas condensate, heavy metals and radioactive material to spread into the ocean. The longer the clean up is delayed, the worse the risks will become. Financial industry criticises plan to tax unrealised superannuation gains A coalition of financial industry bodies and associations have come together to push against the planned tax changes on unrealised superannuation gains. Last week it was most of the crossbench coming together to announce amendments. This week, it is 11 industry and professional bodies “representing accountants, superannuation trustees, financial advisers and other groups”. Unrealised gains are when an asset increases in value, but the capital remains “unrealised” – because you haven’t sold it. Critics of the plan to tax it say it will impact rural, regional and farming businesses, as well as small businesses, who don’t have the cashflow to address the changes. The group have put out a statement saying: Unrealised capital gains in the calculation of earnings is likely to cause liquidity stress for many individuals and business entities impacted by this tax. The University of Adelaide estimates that had this tax been introduced in the 2021 and 2022 financial years, over 13 per cent of impacted members would have experienced liquidity stress in meeting the new tax obligations. Some small business owners will be forced to sell their business premises to save their business. Selling such assets is typically associated with substantial transaction costs and market timing considerations that are likely to further exacerbate potential losses and introduce other investment risks. It’s party room meeting day so the morning will probably get a little calmer. Grab your fifth coffee. Touch some grass. Consider how demure you are. (Yes, it is possible I am too online.) We’ll bring you the updates as soon as the meetings break. Master Builders chief: ‘The ABCC was good, but it didn’t go far enough’ The CEO of Master Builders Australia, Denita Wawn, has been doing a lot of media since the deal between the government and the Coalition on the CFMEU administration legislation was announced. Wawn told Canberra radio 2CC earlier this morning talking about the need for a stronger industry watchdog: The ABCC was good, but it didn’t go far enough. The ABCC only looked after industrial relations laws, and we’ve seen from all the media reports in the last month or two, this is more than that. This is about criminal behaviour. This is about anti-competitive behaviour. This is about governance issues of our sector, and as such we have consistently called for a regulator that covers all of the issues. The nature of the industry, with its contracting and tight deadlines, means that it’s ripe for problems. Four royal commissions have said you need a special regulator with more teeth, so bizarrely enough, the government and the Coalition are both right. We need to combine their thinking and make sure that we do get the special regulator that we really deserve. Peter Dutton has already introduced legislation to reinstate the ABCC, which the government does not support. Privacy reforms may not protect workers from medical tests, thinktank says Proposed privacy law reforms may not go far enough in protecting workers from invasive medical tests, a new study has found. The Australia Institute study, released on Tuesday, investigated the experiences of workers from the mining sector who were forced to undergo blood tests during the recruitment process with little explanation. The report’s author found proposed privacy law reforms, including a “fair and reasonable test”, would not be strict enough to curtail the practice. The findings come in the same month changes to the Privacy Act are expected to be tabled in parliament, as promised by attorney general Mark Dreyfus. – via AAP Does the pen licence still have a place in modern schooling? Slightly outside politics, but something that should unite us all – Caitlin Cassidy has looked at the pen licence, and its place in modern education. Fun fact: I didn’t get my pen licence until I was in Year 7. At the time it was called ‘regrettable and consistent messy writing’ but now they call it ‘ADHD’. The Russian dissident and author Masha Gessen has been issued their visa this morning. Gessen was on RN Breakfast this morning and confirmed that they had received their visa. They had said yesterday their visa had initially been “functionally declined” after the Department of Home Affairs demanded documents that were “not possible” to source. Those demands initially included police checks from Russia, and then police and FBI checks from the United States, where Gessen has never been charged or convicted of anything. Gessen, an outspoken critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, is based in the US and was due to arrive in Australia last weekend to speak at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas this coming weekend. Gessen was charged in Russia on charges of spreading false information about the military and was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison in July. Adam Bandt also had some comments about the CFMEU administration legislation deal between the government and the coalition: On CFMEU, Bandt said: Labor has chosen to work with the anti-union, anti-worker Liberals to rush through legislation that civil liberties groups are saying is a serious threat to the rule of law. Under this legislation, if there’s a change of government, Michaelia Cash could sack the administrator and appoint Tony Abbott to run one of the country’s biggest unions. People will find themselves facing lifetime bans from working in the industry, but there’s no process that is required to go through beforehand to prove any allegations against them, and as a result, there could be a number of people who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong who find themselves with a black mark against their name and unable to get their way back into their job. This is what happens when you rush serious legislation like this. Bandt also rebuffed suggestions the Greens had not been critical of the allegations against some branches of the CFMEU: There should be no tolerance for sexism, for violence, or for corruption. All of those things have no place in any workplace or in any organisation, whether it’s a corporation or a union or a government. But what Labor and the anti-worker Liberals have done is rushed through legislation that is an unprecedented attack on the rule of law. Bandt says Dutton has ‘made a career out of punching down’ The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, held a quick doorstop this morning (unscheduled press conference, traditionally held as someone is entering or exiting a door) where he was asked about the Coalition’s latest attack lines on Palestinian visas. Bandt said: What is clear is Peter Dutton has made a career of punching down. [He] has made a career out of punching down and attacking vulnerable people who are doing nothing more than seeking safety. But Labor bears some responsibility here as well. Labor has from day one backed the invasion of Gaza. And still, even as we hear horrific news that polio is now breaking out in Gaza, that there is a human-engineered famine, that people can’t get enough to drink … Labor refuses to put any pressure on the extremist Netanyahu government to stop the invasion. We’re calling on the government not just to allow our people to come here to seek safety, but also to put pressure on the extremist Netanyahu government to stop the bombing and the invasion which is forcing people to flee in the first place. Community legal centres call for funding to address ‘workforce crisis’ Community legal centres are launching a national campaign this week at Parliament House, calling on the Labor government to properly fund their services. Community legal services support about 180,000 people a year, often at the worst time of their lives, but say they are turning away twice as many people as they can help. It is not a new problem – community legal services have been very vocal about the funding cliff they face. Here is an article from March: The Save Community Legal Centres Campaign has three demands: Immediate funding injection of $35 million to address the workforce crisis, as recommended by the Independent Review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership Additional $135 million each year to sustainably address overall community demand Additional $95 million each year to fully meet domestic and family violence demand An environment group has dropped a long-running legal case against Woodside Energy’s proposed Scarborough gas development off Western Australia’s north-west coast. The Australian Conservation Foundation said it had decided not to proceed with the two-year-old case in the federal court after “it became apparent that the case was unlikely to succeed”. ACF had challenged the federal government’s approval of the $16.5bn project, and argued there should have been an assessment of the impact the development’s emissions would have on the Great Barrier Reef. In a statement, ACF said “the reality is that Australia’s laws work in favour of fossil fuel interests”. There is still no explicit requirement for climate damage to be considered under our key national nature law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This means that, even today, major fossil fuel projects are being approved that will lock in huge volumes of carbon pollution well beyond 2050. Woodside welcomed ACF’s decision. It intends to sell most of the gas from Scarborough to north Asian countries, including Japan. Campaigners have estimated the project could lead to about 1.6bn tonnes of CO2 being released into the atmosphere over its 30-year lifespan. A sales assistant can ‘never’ save for a home deposit, Greens say The Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather is keeping the pressure on the government over housing policy, releasing a new analysis of ATO, RBA lending and CoreLogic house price data showing just how unaffordable house ownership has become. Sarah Basford Canales has covered the analysis, here: Chandler-Mather said the Parliamentary Library analysis shows no one earning the average wage of the top 10 most common professions in Australia could afford to buy a house. A full time child care worker starting to save for a house deposit now, wouldn’t reach their goal until 2055. Meeting their mortgage repayments (on an average loan) would take 92% of their wage. Housing stress is considered anything taking up over 30% of your earnings. A sales assistant would “never” be able to save for a home deposit, Chandler-Mather said. Millions of renters have been caught in a cruel trap, stuck paying massive rents, at best decades away from saving for a home, where even if they can get a mortgage the repayments are completely unaffordable,” the Griffith MP said. How long do the millions getting screwed by Australia’s broken housing system have to wait for this painfully unambitious government to grow a spine and start taking real action on the housing crisis? Murray Watt on visas: ‘We are using exactly the same processes as were used by the Coalition’ The opposition has continued its political attacks against visas being given to Palestinians from Gaza (before Israel seized and completely closed the Rafah border in May). The Australian newspaper has reported: “International data compiled by the opposition indicates Australia’s nearly 3000 approved visas for Gazans since Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attack on Israel far exceed the numbers accepted by the nation’s Five Eyes allies and like-minded countries such as France.” Of the 2,900 visas which were approved, only 1,300 or so Palestinians made it to Australia before the border closure. Another 7,000 visas were rejected, the government has said. Murray Watt is asked about the story and says: We are using exactly the same processes as were used by the Coalition when they were in power and when Peter Dutton was the minister. Mike Burgess, the director general of Asio, has confirmed that himself. Peter Dutton was quite prepared to use certain processes when he was the minister. Now we’re in power, he wants to criticise that. He wants to find division, to find reasons for criticism and be negative of the government. The Greens have also criticised the legislation as giving too much power over unions to the government. Murray Watt rejects that too: I think this is just a ridiculous example he’s [Adam Bandt] giving, to disguise the fact yesterday the Greens were the only party in the parliament who decided to side with John Setka … rather than taking the side of the Australian people. We had a vote in the Parliament yesterday, in the Senate, that called on the Greens to say they wouldn’t take political donations from the CFMEU construction division, they refused to vote for that. So I think it’s pretty clear what the motivation here is in voting against this legislation. Yesterday, the Greens senator David Shoebridge said the Greens had not received a donation from the CFMEU in 10 years: We haven’t received a dollar from the CFMEU for a decade, the Coalition received $175,000 in the last two years, Labor has received millions of dollars and what we say is we have not received the money, it is not why we are engaged in the debate. Watt rejects claims that CFMEU deal is an attack on construction workers The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has rejected claims from some within the CFMEU that the deal the government has struck with the Coalition over legislation to place the construction arm of the union into administration is “an attack on construction workers”. Watt told ABC News Breakfast: I would completely disagree this is an attack on construction workers. Quite the opposite. Construction workers and members of the CFMEU construction division have been let down by the leaders, where we’ve seen organised crime and bikies infiltrate the union at the expense of the members. It’s about rebuilding the union, get back its focus on representing the interests of its members. (continued from previous post) Estimates suggest that Australians lost approximately $25bn on legal forms of gambling in 2018–19, representing the largest per capita losses in the world. RACP president Dr Jennifer Martin said the government must treat gambling as a health issue. She said: There needs to be appropriate investment in wrap-around services for people who are impacted, ensuring access to treatment and support to everyone who needs them. Ultimately, without a ban on all forms of gambling advertising the health of Australians is put at serious risk. Two peak medical bodies have called on the government to implement an outright ban on gambling advertising, saying they are seeing an increasing number of patients being harmed by it. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) released a joint statement on Tuesday on the prevention and treatment of gambling-related harm. The statement highlights an urgent need for legislative action to address gambling harm. The statement also calls on the federal, state and territory governments to remove barriers preventing people from seeking treatment for addiction. Dr Elizabeth Moore, the RANZCP president, said “increasing rates of gambling-related harm among Australians is a significant concern for psychiatrists, given its strong correlation with comorbid mental health disorders”. It can tear apart families, fueling financial troubles, economic abuse, and intimate partner violence, with gambling proven to intensify the factors that drive violence against women and their economic abuse. Banning all forms of gambling advertising through legislation is critical to address their pervasive effect on people’s mental health and wellbeing. Plibersek on sacred site protection at goldmine project: ‘Occasionally decisions like this need to be taken’ The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has spoken to ABC radio AM early this morning, defending her decision to place an Indigenous protection order over a goldmine in western NSW. The mine’s owner took to the ASX with a statement to say the order made the McPhillamys Gold project unviable. The decision has kicked off a firestorm of warnings from the mining industry and its advocates that it sets a precedent that could ‘threaten’ all mining projects. Plibersek says protecting cultural heritage should be paramount. The truth is, we are living in a country where we’ve got thousands of years of continuous culture and heritage. We’ve done a pretty bad job of protecting it in the past, the Juukan Gorge tragedy was an extreme example of that. Liberal, Labor, the Nationals – everyone in the parliament said, ‘we can’t allow things like this to happen again. It was terrible for our reputation as a nation internationally’. If that is the case, if we sincerely believe that we can’t allow the destruction of cultural heritage in that way, then occasionally decisions like this have to be taken. The former Labor senator Fatima Payman has reiterated that she does not have “any plans” to form a new political party, but her new chief of staff says it is “a discussion we need to have”. The ABC’s Australian Story program last night profiled the independent senator, who quit the Labor party to sit on the crossbench in protest at what she saw as its inadequate stance against the Israeli assault on Gaza. In an interview with the program, Payman’s chief of staff, Glenn Druery, was asked whether there were plans to form a new party and he replied: It’s certainly a discussion we need to have. Yes, it’s a discussion we must have. Payman told the same program: I do not have any plans on forming a party, but I will not be joining the Greens and nor will I be forming a Muslim-only party. Something I’ve learned about politics is you never commit definitively to anything, because it will come around and bite you in the backside. Druery, the political strategist and so-called “preference whisperer”, told Guardian Australia on 9 August that “if, in the future, the senator does decide she wants to get involved in a political party, my advice would be to stay away from any party with a religious base” because “in electoral terms that will just not work”. (Continued from last post) Penny Wong also used the speech to announce plans to help Australians build deeper connections with the Indo-Pacific region. This will include a doubling of long-term scholarships available under the New Colombo Plan, from 150 to 300. Wong, who was born in Malaysia, told the ANU’s Centre for Asian-Australian Leadership: It would have been unimaginable to me, when I first came to this country, that I would one day be Australia’s foreign minister or government leader in the Senate. Such an idea would have been as fantastic as fiction. Nothing in those early years as an Asian kid in Adelaide – whose parents were married while the White Australia Policy was still in place … Nothing in those early years suggested this was a possibility. The experiences of prejudice and racism that will be too familiar to many of you. Wong said that early in her political career “it felt daunting, to so often be the first”. She said her first few years in the Senate were shared with the Chinese-Australian politician Tsebin Tchen “until the Liberal party didn’t preselect him for a second term”. She added: There were times when it felt like the only other Asian faces I would see in Parliament House were the cleaners and a woman who worked in the library. Wong said she felt pressure “not to stuff it up”, and that was why she tried hard to avoid make mistakes, which led people to criticise her “as robotic, wooden, cold”. But she expressed hope “that in the not too distant future, we will see more Asian-Australians become cabinet ministers and leaders and it will be entirely unremarkable”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has hit out at narratives of immigrants being a “burden” or “peril” as she accused the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, of reviving “divisive” rhetoric about Palestinian refugees. Offering some personal reflections in a speech to the Australian National University’s Centre for Asian-Australian Leadership last night, Wong said: Asian-Australians – particularly of my generation – will be all too familiar with the narrative of immigrant as burden, as peril, a drain on resources, a threat to cohesion. We saw it from Mr Howard in the 1980s, when he called for a reduction in Asian immigration. I will never forget the toll that took on my family. We see again it from Mr Dutton today. We know where these words land. We know what communities hear when the opposition deliberately revives this divisive rhetoric. Dutton last week called for a temporary blanket ban on Australia granting visas to Palestinians escaping the deadly conflict in Gaza, prompting the government to accuse him of politicising national security for domestic political gain. Wong said last night that politicians had “a responsibility to take care with their words” and “to not just seize a political opportunity but consider the implications of their words and actions”. She added: This fearmongering is damaging in our community and it is a lost opportunity for Australia – to be more unified, to avoid reproducing other conflicts here. Happy Tuesday blog watchers and thank you for choosing to spend part of your day with us. It’s a fairly big day in the parliament with lots of moving parts and we will do our best to keep you across all of them. Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles will meet with Indonesia’s president-elect Prabowo Subianto a little later today. The Indonesian presidential elections were held in February, but Prabowo only secured a parliamentary majority recently. His trip to Australia will be based on the “shared economic, security and net zero transition priorities” and comes ahead of his inauguration in October. Australia and Indonesia have had bilateral relations for 75 years this year. While defence, economics, trade and climate will be on the agenda, Human Rights Watch hopes meeting human rights commitments will also be raised. Daniela Gavshon, the Australian director at Human Rights Watch said previous Indonesian administrations had made commitments, but failed to meet them, “These include some difficult issues such as the mandatory hijab rules, the crackdown on LGBT people, and the government’s unwillingness to allow foreign journalists and United Nations officials to visit West Papua.” On the domestic agenda, Labor will get its CFMEU administration legislation through the parliament after folding on some of the Coalition’s demands, including that the administration be for a minimum of three years, not the maximum Labor had originally pledged, that there be regular reporting from the administrator to the parliament, and that the CFMEU not give any political donations while under administration. Some unionists are outraged over the deal, given the government could have negotiated with the Greens and crossbench for the numbers needed in the senate, but Labor was keen to avoid a drawn out fight on unions this close to the next election. Meanwhile, the former Labor senator Fatima Payman has *kinda* ruled out starting her own party – at least for now – in an ABC Australian Story feature. Payman told the program: Something I’ve learned about politics is you never commit definitively to anything, because it will come around and bite you in the backside. And Penny Wong has delivered a rather reflective speech at the Australian National University’s Centre for Asian-Australian Leadership overnight. Daniel Hurst will have more for you, but the foreign minister spoke about her start in politics and the pressure she felt “not to stuff it up”. The Future Made in Australia legislation continues its way through the parliament, and the party room meetings will be held in the shadow of Peter Dutton and the Coalition’s ongoing war against Palestinian visas and security checks. If you missed this yesterday, we recommend it to start your day given what is no doubt ahead. Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Sarah Basford Canales and Daniel Hurst are all preparing to keep you updated as the day rolls on in Canberra. You have Amy Remeikis (and so far 2.5 coffees) on the blog. Ready? Let’s get into it.","2024-08-20T08:22:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/aug/20/politics-fatima-payman-cfmeu-labor-coalition-question-time-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-greens-canberra-ntwnfb"
"abortion","A South Australian MP’s mad anti-abortion bill shows the culture wars are far from over ","I spend an uncommon amount of time in South Australia for a person who doesn’t actually live there; I’d never heard of South Australian Liberal MP Ben Hood until his current private member’s bill to repoliticise abortion in the worst possible way. Appointed directly by his party to fill a casual upper house vacancy last year, Hood was last before the will of the people when he contested Mt Gambier’s House of Assembly seat for the Liberal party in 2022 and lost. But with an electoral mandate of zero, the MP is now famous – congratulations, Ben – for reinflaming debate on the settled issue of abortion. I say settled because abortion access remains a political unifier of compelling power in democratic Australia, with no less than 80% of the population consistently supporting reproductive rights. For many years, the electorate was frustratingly ahead of the Australian state legislatures who have legal provenance over the issue. Queensland and New South Wales took until an enraging 2018 and 2019 to decriminalise abortion as per public demand. To bring its suite of laws into line with community attitudes was precisely why South Australia reformed its own abortion laws in 2021. Hood’s issue is with South Australia’s legal provisions around “late-term abortions”, performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. They amount to barely 1% of all pregnancy terminations and are performed almost exclusively for dire medical reasons, obliging two doctors to formally concur to their necessity. Hood’s three-page proposed amendment to the bill would mean – and I quote the ABC here – that people in that horrific situation “would be required to give birth”. Improbably, he goes on: “A medical practitioner may only intervene to end the pregnancy of a person who is more than 27 weeks and 6 days pregnant if the intention is to deliver the foetus alive.” Anything else – quoth someone who is never going to be pregnant and never going to give birth – is “foeticide”. Doctor after doctor has condemned Hood’s bill. A spokesperson for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) showed remarkable restraint limiting public comments to a declaration that decisions around terminations were for patients and doctors, “rather than being made by politicians”. Of course, the decision is not going to be made by Hood, who doesn’t have the power of government or anything like a parliamentary majority to crunch his proposal through. Although the Liberals allow a conscience vote on the issue, MPs from his own party were instrumental in changing the law three years ago and MP Michelle Lensink from his own party has been quoted as saying “I think some of my House of Assembly [colleagues] are more angry than I’ve ever seen them.” The South Australian party leader, Vincent Tarzia, said “changing the laws around late term termination is not Liberal party policy”. The Labor health minister, Chris Picton, denounced it as “an extreme rightwing culture war bill”. And he’s right. Some may suppose it possible that Hood is just another authoritarian banana inspired by the lethal current madness in the United States into a zealot’s crusade to demand outcomes both cruel and ridiculous. Others may delve a little deeper into the psychology of who supports anti-abortion positions and consider traces of political habit. Pro-choice bills have always had a harder fight for support in parliaments than electorates because there’s always one or two someones in every party who are squeamish on the subject, whether because of who supports them politically or the traditions and values that have informed their political self-identity. But what researchers have known for some time about anti-abortion politics is that those who hold them are powerfully disposed to moral absolutism and a profound in-group loyalty that comes to define them socially. They also defer to authoritarian values and adhere to hierarchies of control. Although this is a minority of the population, the channelled energy of this community, once animated, can be of great political use – for instance, to voluntarily build online disinformation infrastructure that can be switched on and off for other political causes at convenience. Why the formerly once “very pro-choice” Donald Trump has cleaved the extreme anti-abortion cause to his own political identity, despite its unpopularity with the American electorate, is maybe explained thus, given the tactics he demonstrates. Trump understands – as everyone should – that politics is never as much about winning an issue as it is about winning power. Whether Ben Hood MP’s mad forced-birth proposals have a broader tactical purpose or not, their only immediate victory has been an uncomfortable reminder to the electorate: while the reproductive rights battle is long won, the culture war around it may never be over. • Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist","2024-09-26T05:17:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/26/a-south-australian-mps-mad-anti-abortion-bill-shows-the-culture-wars-are-far-from-over"
"abortion","Virulent debater and clickbait savant: how Charlie Kirk pushed a new generation to the right","After clinching the title of top conservative podcast in America (and second overall news podcast, according to Apple’s ranking) in March, Charlie Kirk said: “We’re not just talking. We’re activating a revolution.” In the hours after his killing at age 31 on the first stop of a buzzy college campus tour, the rightwing activist’s words echoed through young conservative circles. Social media eulogies rolled in, with users reposting clips of Kirk with his wife and children. Parents of teens wrote on X of learning about Kirk’s death through their children. “My 17 year old is bumming. Told me he plays Charlie in the background on his computer when he’s on it,” the conservative radio host Jesse Kelly wrote on X. Another X user wrote about speaking to teens at a church youth group: “Everyone I talked to is so distraught and heartbroken at his passing.” A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both. Kirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn’t agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events. He was like a gen Z and millennial version of Rush Limbaugh – the rightwing, shock-jock commentator who dominated US airwaves in the 1990s – even if his base had no clue who that was. Kirk’s ideology was caustic; he espoused openly homophobic, racist, sexist, Islamophobic and Christian nationalist views while uplifting misinformation and conspiracy theories. He also campaigned on issues that mattered to young Americans, engaging directly with them – no matter how virulently – on hot-button topics such as abortion, transgender rights, race and Palestinian solidarity. Amy Binder, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University who studies politics and education, describes Kirk’s values as “insurgency conservatism” that was “designed to get attention”. It worked: TikTok users under 30 who voted for Trump in 2024 said they trusted Kirk more than any other individual, according to a New York Times profile, despite the fact that he never held office or a role in the White House. That election saw male voters ages 18 to 29 swing hard to the right; Trump also made inroads with gen Z women. Earlier this year, Trump praised Kirk for “what he’s done with the young people”. As a millennial growing up in the Chicago suburbs, Kirk was obsessed with Limbaugh and the Tea Party movement. His fans also felt like outsiders within the American political system. “After Trump was elected in 2016, I was really surprised to see just how many students who were conservative were no longer identifying with the Republican party or with college Republicans, and had instead pivoted over to being really intrigued with what Turning Point was doing on campus,” Binder said. “They were doing much more exciting programming. It was less electorally focused, less about campaigning, and more about having events that were really confrontational.” Kirk appeared equally at ease chumming it up with high-powered donors as he did debating 20-year-olds in sweatpants. Kirk sparred directly with young people through video templates such as “prove me wrong” (a one-on-one debate, where students could wait in line to ask him a question), and he was an early guest on the YouTube series Surrounded, where he sat in a room with 25 liberals and goaded them with statements such as “abortion is murder and should be illegal” and “trans women are not women.” Turning Point USA raked in funding – the New York Times estimated a $92.4m revenue in 2023 – while advancing campus culture wars. Kirk’s content brought classic and extreme rightwing ideals to young people’s media feeds; he looked like both an old-school, suited conservative in the style of a Fox News host, and a social media-savvy man of the times. His video titles usually bent toward hyperbole (“Charlie Kirk Crushes Woke Lies at Michigan State,” was posted less than a week before the shooting). There were gonzo premises, such as when Kirk and the YouTube prank team Nelk Boys showed up at a Wisconsin frat party to get out the vote in 2024. His meme literacy showed when he handed out hats that read: “White Boy Summer”, a remix of Megan Thee Stallion’s “Hot Girl Summer” catchphrase. With his wife, Erika, owner of a faith-based fashion brand and a former Miss Arizona USA, Kirk softened his image, presenting himself as devoted husband, father and a bit of a lifestyle influencer. He talked to tweens in Maga hats about his preferred Starbucks order and promoted “cuteservatives” like Alex Clark, a Turning Point USA podcaster who branded her show on Maha culture as a rightwing Call Her Daddy. After Kirk’s death, Brett Cooper, a 23-year-old conservative influencer in the “womanosphere” with more than 1 million Instagram followers, reposted a video homage that depicted him as a champion for girls and young women. (Yet this was a man who compared abortion to the Holocaust and claimed that women over 30 “aren’t attractive in the dating pool”.) For 10 years, Turning Point USA hosted a “women’s summit”, where Kirk and others like Clark and Cooper encouraged attenders to focus on finding husbands. Evie, the conservative women’s magazine, published an obituary that called Kirk a “loving father, patriot, and husband”. Even young people who were disgusted by Kirk’s rhetoric could not deny his impact. Hasan Piker, the hugely popular leftwing Twitch streamer whose ideology stands in direct contrast to Kirk, was scheduled to debate with Kirk at the end of September at Dartmouth University. Both Piker and the gun control activist David Hogg spoke against political violence in the wake of the shooting (as did many Democratic figures such as Joe Biden, Gavin Newsom and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani). Piker told his followers not to make jokes about Kirk’s shooting. “This is a terrifying incident,” Piker said. Hogg called the news “horrifying” on X. “I think it’s undeniable to say that Kirk was one of the first and most prominent people to shape what it means to be young and on the right in the US,” said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of communications at American University who studies extremism. After Kirk’s death, Braddock said he had seen “individuals calling this an inflection point, or a turning point where the left can no longer be tolerated”. Rightwing pundits have been eager to blame the left for the shooting. Adam Pennings, 25, is the executive director of Run Gen Z, a non-profit that supports young Republican candidates. “He’s always just been such an important part” of the young conservative party, Pennings said of Kirk. “He was everywhere.” Pennings knew Kirk through his work, but the two were not close. Still, Pennings said, due to Kirk’s omnipresence: “I feel like I lost a friend.”","2025-09-12T09:00:31Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/charlie-kirk-young-conservatives-social-media"
"abortion","‘I try not to get my hopes up’: campaigners make final push to save abortion rights in Florida","As she stood in the parking lot of an auto supply store on Friday evening, Brittany Robinson was practically vibrating. With just a few days left before the 2024 presidential elections, the 32-year-old Floridian needed an outlet for her anxiety. So Robinson decided to go knock on strangers’ doors in support of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that, if passed, would enshrine abortion rights into Florida’s constitution and overturn the state’s six-week abortion ban. “I wish I started earlier,” said Robinson, a native of the Tampa Bay area who had never before canvassed for a political campaign. Living under Florida’s ban, she said, is “terrifying”. When she was a freshman in college 13 years ago, Robinson discovered she was seven weeks pregnant and had an abortion a week later. “I wouldn’t have been able to do that now,” Robinson said. Come Tuesday, Florida will be one of 10 states where voters will have the chance to amend their state constitution to add or expand abortion rights. Of all those measures, the battle in Florida may be the most intense – and the most uphill for supporters of abortion rights. Florida has taken a sharp turn towards the right in recent years, and its hardline conservative government has effectively launched a war against the Amendment 4 campaign. Amendment 4 needs to garner 60% of the vote to pass. Although abortion rights advocates have won every post-Roe v Wade abortion ballot measure in the US, none have hit that threshold. “I am extremely confident that the people of Florida want Amendment 4 to be passed,” said Laura Shaw, a 21-year-old working on the campaign. “However, I am also all too aware of the steps that the Florida government is taking to suppress those ideas.” In the last days before the election, nothing seemed certain. “I don’t know what to think,” said Sanderlyne St Cyr, a 20-year-old who voted early for Amendment 4. “I’m just going to sit back and observe and let Jesus take the wheel.” Over the last several weeks, Florida law enforcement has investigated people who signed a petition to get the measure on the ballot, while the health department sent cease-and-desist letters to local TV stations that aired an ad supporting it. (Abortion rights activists sued and won.) Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has also claimed that Amendment 4 would eliminate a law that requires Florida minors to obtain parental consent before getting an abortion – a claim legal experts say is overblown. While canvassing, Makenzie Martin, a 23-year-old organizer with the campaign for Amendment 4, has run into people who wrongly believe that the measure – which would protect the right to abortion until viability, or about 24 weeks – would allow abortions into the ninth month of pregnancy. One woman, Martin said, thought abortion rights activists wanted to allow doctors to perform abortions after birth – a wildly inaccurate talking point that Donald Trump has raised repeatedly in presidential debates. (That would be murder and it is already illegal.) There are now more than 1 million more registered Republicans in Florida than Democrats, which means that in order to pass, the nonpartisan campaign for Amendment 4 will probably need to secure the votes of a sizable swath of Trump supporters. One recent poll found that 58% of Florida voters supported Amendment 4, while 34% opposed it. Six per cent were undecided. Instructions handed out to canvassers advise them not to respond to any comments about candidates and to emphasize how the amendment would “kick ALL POLITICIANS, regardless of their party affiliation, out of private medical decisions”. The instructions also suggest that canvassers ignore public polls and claim that most of them have been surveying people “in ways that are highly misleading”. As she knocked on doors in one Tampa neighborhood on Friday evening, Martin had little luck getting voters to answer. Although one woman heartily agreed with Amendment 4 – “You never know what a woman is going through!” she shouted from her yard at Martin, adding: “She could have gotten raped!” – Martin more often ended up just tucking purplish brochures about the measure into houses’ chain-link fences. Robinson, too, largely struck out. However, she was delighted to encounter a teenage girl at one house, who, Robinson said, excitedly endorsed Amendment 4. Shaw had better luck earlier in the day, when she and other organizers set up a blue tent near an early voting site on the University of Southern Florida, Tampa, campus, where they handed out Amendment 4 merchandise and neon-colored boxes of emergency contraception. Several of the dozens of people who stopped by already knew about and supported Amendment 4. When Shaw tried to walk one woman through her pitch, the woman cut her off: “This is to end the abortion ban, right?” She then unfurled a sample ballot; all she wanted was for Shaw to tell her how to vote yes. “I’m a nurse, so I worry about my patients’ rights too. My biggest thing with all my patients is: ‘It’s your body, it’s your choice,’” said Lauren, who asked that her last name not be published due to her conservative workplace. She’s trying not to think about election day or what its outcome may be. “Honestly, I have no idea,” she said. “I try not to get my hopes up.”","2024-11-02T14:25:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/florida-amendment-4-abortion-rights"
"abortion","Unlike Joe Biden, Kamala Harris will be a genuine champion for abortion rights","When he was still the nominee, Joe Biden’s preferred euphemism for abortion was “Roe”. He would talk about “upholding” Roe v Wade even after June 2022, when the US supreme court struck it down. Reproductive rights advocates bristled at this, pointing out how many people had been denied abortions under Roe, and how flimsy the decision’s protection of reproductive rights had been on personal-autonomy or sex-equality grounds. Frankly, it was hard to get the president to talk about abortion at all. He seemed to avoid even the word “abortion”. When he did talk about the procedure – and the bans on it that Republicans have unleashed across the country – he preferred to focus on women who had been denied emergency abortions for wanted pregnancies in the midst of tragic health complications. Abortion, in his hands, became an issue in which sad, troubled and helpless women could be aided by the mercy of heroic men like himself – or like that of the imagined doctor he referenced in his disastrous June debate with Donald Trump, a man, Biden said, who would determine whether an abortion seeker “needed help or not”. Abortion, in his telling, was an unpleasant but necessary evil that men mediated for women. It was decidedly not a matter of adult women’s rights, dignity or right of autonomy over their own bodies and lives. Kamala Harris, Biden’s successor at the top of the Democratic ticket following his withdrawal last Sunday, has taken a different approach. The Biden administration had largely delegated abortion rights messaging to the vice-president, out of deference both for Biden’s obvious personal discomfort with the issue and his growing inability to campaign effectively at all. (The anti-choice group Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America named Harris as Biden’s “abortion czar”, a name that perhaps sounds a little cooler than they intended.) She made a multistate tour focusing on the issue earlier this year, which included what is believed to be the first public visit to an abortion clinic by a president or vice-president: a stop at a Planned Parenthood in St Paul, Minnesota, where Harris appeared with the clinic’s medical director, and commended the clinic’s staff for their “true leadership”. “It is only right and fair that people have access to the healthcare they need,” she said. The result was a divergence of abortion messaging within the White House, with Harris making a much more robust case for abortion, and for reproductive justice more broadly, in much more affirmative and unapologetic terms. The preferred catchphrase that she repeated when speaking about the issue was not Biden’s tepid and euphemistic “restore Roe”. Instead, Harris has made apparent reference to Dr George Tiller, an abortion doctor who was murdered by anti-choice extremists in 2009, who summarized his own approach to abortion in two words: “Trust women.” Before Biden dropped out of the race, November’s presidential election was set to be little more than a referendum on his age. But now that he has stepped aside, Harris has an opportunity to make a much stronger case for a Democratic policy vision. And reproductive rights, an issue that has motivated women voters in large numbers even in deep-conservative states since the Dobbs decision, appears to be at the center of her agenda. The move is good politics. Abortion rights are extraordinarily popular, and have only become more so in the years since Dobbs, mobilizing voters who would stay home or vote for Republicans when other issues are more salient. A new poll from the Associated Press finds that six in 10 Americans support abortion for any reason; other polls show even higher levels of support for abortion, especially early in pregnancy. It’s not just that abortion, in the abstract, is popular: abortion bans, in particular, are profoundly unpopular. The reality of post-Dobbs bans has dramatically moved public opinion on the issue: since May 2019, the percent of Americans who say that abortion should be legal under all circumstances has increased by 10 points, to 35%. The percent who say it should be illegal under all circumstances – the position advocated by the Republican party platform, which supports recognition of fetuses and embryos as persons under the 14th amendment – has fallen dramatically during that same period, to just 12%. These shifts in public opinion have had a marked impact at the ballot box. Democrats’ better-than-expected showing in the November 2022 midterms is credited to outrage against the Dobbs decision that June. But a desire to protect or restore abortion rights has driven large turnout even in heavily Republican states: Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio have all voted overwhelmingly in favor of abortion rights since Dobbs. Harris has seized on this shift in a way that Biden has not been able to, speaking passionately – and credibly – about abortion as a matter of not only health, but also dignity. Harris has also cannily and repeatedly drawn connections between Trump’s last term, in which three anti-choice zealots were appointed to the US supreme court, and the suffering that abortion bans have caused in Republican-controlled states. She refers to the state laws prohibiting the procedure as “Trump abortion bans”. This focus could bear fruit in November: alongside Harris’s presidential bid, a total of five states – Nevada, Colorado, South Dakota, Maryland and Florida – will have abortion-rights measures on the ballot. The Republican ticket, meanwhile, has leaned further and further into an ideology of misogyny and gender reaction. Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, is a passionate and lurid misogynist; he recently referred to Harris and other Democratic women as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives”, and that childless women “have no direct stake” in America’s future. He has also suggested that citizens without children should have their votes diluted. Childless women seem to be a particularly irksome demographic for the Trump camp’s army of prurient creeps: both the media personality Laura Loomer and the lawyer and thinktank gadfly Will Chamberlain quickly joined Vance in attacking Harris for not having biological children. It’s a fitting line of attack; after all, the very reason why Republicans are pursuing abortion bans in the first place is because they have an extremely narrow view of what women should be, one they want to enforce with the law. Abortion-rights advocates will certainly seek to push Harris for even more commitments for reproductive freedom and justice. But Harris, at least, is willing to argue that women can be things other than mothers. Like maybe the president.

"abortion","Cecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood, dies at 67","Cecile Richards, the former president of Planned Parenthood who helped turn the reproductive healthcare giant into a formidable political organization and make support for abortion rights a virtual requirement for Democratic candidates, died on Monday after a battle with brain cancer. She was 67. “This morning our beloved Cecile passed away at home, surrounded by her family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,” Richards’ family wrote in a statement. “Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives.” Over the course of her career, Richards became one of the biggest faces of US abortion rights, if not one of the most important American activists of the 21st century. Under her watch, Planned Parenthood became a mainstay in Democratic politics, battled numerous congressional attempts to defund the organization, and tried to dam a torrent of state-level efforts to restrict abortion access. Her mother, the former Texas governor Ann Richards, was a political legend, but Richards herself became a household name in 2015, after anti-abortion activists released secret recordings of Planned Parenthood workers purportedly discussing the sale of fetal tissue. The recordings – which Planned Parenthood said were doctored – spurred multiple congressional and state investigations that could not substantiate their contents, and led US House Republicans to grill Richards in an hours-long, highly publicized hearing. After stepping down from Planned Parenthood in 2018, Richards went on to found Supermajority, an organization dedicated to championing women’s leadership. After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 – in a case involving the kind of state-level abortion restrictions that Richards tried to defeat – Richards started Charley, a bot to help abortion seekers get accurate information about the procedure, and Abortion in America, a campaign to publicize stories of post-Roe abortions. In late 2024, Joe Biden awarded Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the US. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned as a lifelong organizer is that there are no permanent wins and no permanent losses. We have to fight for every inch of progress, and we can’t take anything for granted,” Richards wrote on Instagram after receiving the honor. “That’s especially true in challenging moments like the one we find ourselves in now. But what a joy and a privilege it is to be part of the long struggle to make our country a fairer and more hopeful place.” Richards was born on 15 July 1957, in Waco, Texas, and was primarily raised in Dallas and Austin. Her political involvement began early in life, as her parents were ardent progressives. “They were into politics like other couples were into bowling,” Richards told NPR in 2014. “Every movement that came through town, whether it was the farm workers, the labor movement, the women’s movement, they were into and so were all their friends.” After graduating from Brown University, Richards started working as a labor organizer in Louisiana, where she met her husband, Kirk Adams, who went on to hold leadership positions at the powerful Service Employees International Union. The couple had three children together. Ahead of the 1990 election, the family moved back to Texas to help Ann Richards run for governor. Known for her silvery, sky-high hair and acerbic wit – during her address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Richards famously declared that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, “just backwards and in high heels” – Richards eked out a narrow victory, thanks to a coalition of female voters and voters of color. She then lost her 1994 re-election campaign (to future US president George W Bush), but remained Cecile Richards’ political north star for the rest of Cecile’s life. A chapter of Cecile Richards’ best-selling 2018 memoir, Make Trouble, is titled: “What Would Ann Richards Do?” After Ann Richards’ gubernatorial loss, Cecile attended a 1995 Texas state board of education meeting, where she watched rightwing activists crusade against providing students with information about sex education and LGBTQ+ rights. Struck by the religious right’s rising power, Richards founded Texas Freedom Network, one of the most prominent progressive advocacy organizations in the Lone Star State. Richards later moved to Washington DC, where she served as Nancy Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff before helping to found and lead the voting rights coalition America Votes. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America hired Richards as president in 2006. Two years later, the non-profit endorsed Barack Obama for president. It was only the second time in the group’s 85-year history that it had endorsed a candidate for president, but it heralded Planned Parenthood’s increased commitment to electoral politics – a hallmark of Richards’ time at its helm. By greatly expanding Planned Parenthood’s fundraising and state-level organizing, especially in the face of repeated Republican efforts to defund it, Richards made it into an organization that could corral votes as well as make or break political candidates. After 2010, when Democrats’ inter-party arguing over abortion coverage nearly defeated the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood worked to turn support for abortion rights into a key plank in the Democratic party platform. Today, there is just one anti-abortion Democrat in Congress. After being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2023, Richards continued to work on leftwing causes. She co-chaired American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic network that includes a formidable Super Pac, and spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in support of Kamala Harris. Alongside Kate Cox, a Texan woman who sued after being denied a medically necessary abortion, Richards cast Texas’s ceremonial votes in support of Harris. In their statement, Richards’ family said that those who wished to honor Richards’ memory should keep in mind something she frequently said over the last year of her life: “It’s hard not to imagine future generations one day asking: ‘When there was so much at stake for our country, what did you do?’ The only acceptable answer is: ‘Everything we could.’”","2025-01-20T15:26:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/cecile-richard-planned-parenthood-dies"
"abortion","This is how we do it: ‘I want sex four or five times a day, but I’m learning to respect her libido’","Grace, 33 “We’ve been getting to know each other and building intimacy in bursts of a few weeks at a time Theo and I have friends in common, and we slept together casually in our early 20s. After I moved abroad, we lost touch. Nine years later, in 2023, we fell for each other. I was on holiday by myself in Spain, and he replied to a thirst trap I’d posted, saying he was going to be in the same region. We went back to my hotel after dinner and had Negroni-fuelled, animalistic sex. In my 20s, I was self-conscious about my body and inexperienced, but by my 30s I was much more confident in myself, my skills and my body. We’ve been in a long-distance relationship for the past year and a half, getting to know each other and building intimacy in bursts of a few weeks at a time, either on holiday or when he comes to visit me. This summer, we lived together for three months and, apart from when I had thrush, had sex two or three times a week. I thought I had a high sex drive, but Theo’s is higher. He gets hard very quickly, whereas I need a build-up. If I’m feeling bloated, anxious or low in confidence, I find it harder to get in the mood. I lost my job recently, which affected my self-esteem, which then affected intimacy. We also had an abortion last year, which was difficult, but it brought us closer and forced us to have conversations – about kids and the future – that we hadn’t yet had. Theo is my first boyfriend, my best friend and the love of my life. I love how complimentary he is; he encourages me to look at my body in the mirror, telling me I’m beautiful. He makes me feel very safe, and I can be completely myself with him. Having that level of intimacy with someone for the first time feels very different to the sex I had in my 20s. I send him silly, ugly photos that I wouldn’t send to anybody else, and that playfulness translates into our sex life. This is the first serious relationship for both of us, so we’re learning together. As very independent people, we’re understanding how to commit to someone and to know ourselves better while being in a relationship, rather than losing the people we’ve spent decades becoming. Theo, 32 “Because we don’t live in the same country, if it’s not really intense after we haven’t seen each other for a month, I worry Grace and I had an instant connection when we met at a festival in our 20s; it was as though we already knew each other. We had bizarre things in common, like her studying in the small town in Italy where my dad is from. I was attracted to her aura, her eyes, her warmth, and invited her to stay at my parents’ up north, where we slept together for the first time. I’d been single since I was 18, put off by commitment after what felt like an intense relationship for that age. Intimacy scared me; I prioritised my freedom and autonomy. Although sex with Grace was more intimate than other sex I was having, and she was someone I wanted to spend time with, not just have sex with, I wasn’t looking for anything serious at that time. When we reconnected a couple of years ago, I’d spent a long time being avoidant. When I didn’t address where our relationship was going, or my flights to visit her were delayed or cancelled, I worried Grace would still see me as the flaky, unreliable boy that I was when we first met, but she didn’t put pressure on me. Our relationship has existed in a space that isn’t reality – on holiday and at festivals – but tough moments have taught us more about each other. When we decided to have an abortion, we had to learn how to be vulnerable. Our intimacy has evolved, with long phone calls and intimate photos, which show she’s thinking about me. I’m very attracted to Grace and want to have sex with her four or five times a day. Because we don’t live in the same country, if it’s not really intense after we haven’t seen each other for a month, I worry about what it’s going to be like in 10 years when we have kids. But I need to be respectful of Grace’s libido too, its ebbs and flows. So I’m learning to ask myself, what makes her want to be in the mood? How can I be more attractive to her?","2025-09-14T10:00:31Z","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/14/this-is-how-we-do-it-i-want-sex-four-or-five-times-a-day-but-im-learning-to-respect-her-libido"
"abortion","Trump news at a glance: megabill hangs in balance as House Republicans struggle to convince holdouts","The House of Representatives was at a standstill on Wednesday as Republican leaders continued to try to rally holdouts against Donald Trump’s megabill, with speaker Mike Johnson saying “very positive” progress had been made toward passing it. The House stalled for hours on a procedural vote while Johnson and the White House worked to pressure a handful of Republicans to ensure they would vote to approve the sweeping tax-and-spending bill amid a razor-thin Republican majority and get it to Trump to sign in time for his self-imposed 4 July deadline. CBS parent company Paramount, meanwhile, agreed to pay $16m to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a broadcast interview, in what is likely to be seen as a further example of capitulation by media companies hoping to smooth relations with the president. Here are the day’s key US politics stories at a glance: House to vote on Trump’s big policy bill Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spending bill was hanging in the balance as Republicans struggled to muster sufficient votes in the US House of Representatives. A five-minute procedural vote remained open and tied on Wednesday, as Republican leaders told members they could leave the floor, suggesting they still did not have the numbers they needed. If passed, the bill would vastly expand the federal government’s immigration enforcement machinery and supercharge the president’s plan to carry out what he has vowed will be the largest deportation campaign in US history. Trump, vice-president JD Vance and speaker Mike Johnson spent much of the day trying to pressure conservatives to support the bill in the face of changes made by the Senate.

"abortion","Almost 200 countries guarantee children’s rights. Why doesn’t the US?","Every school year, midwife Lisa Isman meets dozens of eighth-graders for an annual tour of the clinic where she works. Students gather first in the office’s waiting room, where neon green couches, young adult romance novels and pamphlets on loneliness and sexual wellness greet them. On the tour of the Ungdomsmottagning – Swedish for “youth clinic” – the students in this suburb of Stockholm, Sweden, will take a peek at the different exam rooms, meet clinic counselors, and pay a visit to the clinic’s “kondomeria”, a cupboard decorated with condoms posed like action figures and stocked with a variety of brands. The required school tour is an opportunity for Isman and her colleagues to explain to students that, from ages 12 to 22, this is their clinic. And “they can decide for themselves” whether to book an appointment, with or without their parents’ involvement, Isman says. At the youth clinic – one of 300 such spaces across the country – teenagers and young adults can schedule appointments or come to walk-in hours to discuss puberty, period pain, contraception, abortion, anxiety, depression, and a variety of other health concerns. Youth access to healthcare is guaranteed, Isman says, because “in Sweden, the [UN Convention on the Rights of the Child] is now becoming a law, so we are obliged to follow the law”. Children’s right to healthcare is not similarly protected in the US. A fact experts say is apparent in the federal budget currently under debate, which would see significant cuts to programs that help low income children afford food and healthcare, like Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). “There’s no right to these programs,” said Jonathan Todres, a leading expert on children’s rights and law professor at Georgia State University College of Law. “Medicaid, Chip, those all support millions of children, but they don’t establish a right. So at any time the government can choose to cut these programs.” Medicaid and Chip provide health coverage to two in five US children, while Snap provides meals to one in five. The current budget would cut $863.4bn from Medicaid and Chip, and $300bn from Snap, over the next decade. Although children under the age of 18 make up about 22% of the US population, Todres notes that spending on youth only amounts to about 10% of the federal budget. “The right to healthcare is critical and it’s very much under threat in the United States right now for children, and for adults,” said Elizabeth Barnert, a pediatrician and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Because children don’t vote, she fears they are often forgotten in policy, but says the health ramifications of poor access to healthcare “are lifelong and generational”. In 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child – a treaty recognizing children’s human right to, among other things, play, live free from violence and receive healthcare. In the ensuing years, every UN member country would adopt the convention – making it the most widely ratified of the body’s treaties – except the US. Although the US signed the treaty in 1995, it never submitted it to the Senate for ratification. “I think for many people” that fact “becomes even more puzzling when they learn that the United States had a larger impact on the drafting of [the convention] than any other country,” said Todres, who notes the convention was drafted during the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush. “The US stamp is all over this treaty.” The reason the US has long been reluctant to ratify the convention, he believes, is multi-layered. “Historically, the US has always been slow to join human rights treaties. It is typically very active in the creation of human rights treaties, but more cautious when it comes to taking on legal obligations,” Todres said, noting that the US took 40 years to decide whether to ratify the Genocide convention. He adds that the US is often wary that such treaties might challenge its sovereignty. Another reason he identifies is a “much broader culture war” around parents’ and children’s rights in the US, that he believes relies on an inaccurate understanding of children’s rights. The parental rights movement in the US is perhaps today best known for conservative efforts to ban teachers from discussing sexuality and gender identity in schools. But proponents have long campaigned for parents’ rights to determine what their children learn, from withdrawing their children from integrated schools in the 1950s to beginning homeschool coalitions in an effort to avoid sexual education curriculum in the 1990s. Although Republican administrations were highly involved in drafting the children’s rights convention, conservative social groups quickly came to oppose it. In 1999, the Home School Legal Defense Association, a Christian advocacy group focused on the rights of parents who homeschool their children, wrote that “war was declared on parental rights in America” when the US government sent the UN convention to the Senate. It said ratifying the treaty would be a “a direct attack on parents’ rights to choose the form of education and content of education for their children” and that the convention would “outlaw spanking”, give “children the right to listen to rock music” and create a right to privacy that would “invalidate all parental notification laws concerning abortion”. At Isman’s clinic in Stockholm, she says: “We do have parents now that they don’t want their girls to come to our youth clinic because we talk about things they don’t want their girls to know about,” said Isman, who estimates about 90% of the clinic’s patients are female. “You have to try to find ways to talk to those parents and also try to find ways for those kids that are not allowed to come here. How do we reach them?” Isman and her fellow midwives might spend a day helping a young adult choose a method of birth control or schedule an abortion. Down the hall, her social worker and psychologist colleagues might screen teens navigating their mental health for abuse by asking if they’ve ever been spanked or prevented from taking prescribed medications. Both are services that are often difficult to access – or even illegal – in the US. Although Sweden has implemented the UN convention in a way that allows children to access contraceptive and sexual health counseling, including sometimes abortion care, without parental consent, Todres doesn’t imagine the US would do the same, and says the convention leaves enforcement up to each country that ratifies it. He believes controversial health debates that impact only a small number of children, like abortion and gender-affirming care, have distracted from the larger areas where most parents would support their children having access to healthcare. “On the majority of issues, parents’ interests and children’s rights align. If you survey parents, what do they want for their children? They want their children to be safe. They want to be able to take their child to a good doctor when the child needs it, they want the child to receive a quality education,” said Todres. He adds that human rights laws “are designed to protect children and families from abuses by governments”. For Barnert, a right to healthcare means “that every child can have their urgent and emergency needs met, and that every child has access to appropriate evidence-based preventive care”. She finds the human rights framework of the UN convention particularly useful because it considers “a lot of barriers that aren’t the healthcare itself that interfere with patients’ abilities to get healthcare”, like the cost of transportation or parking, being able to take time off of work, feeling safe going to a doctor’s office regardless of immigration status or accessing non-politicized, evidence-based care, like vaccines. It’s not likely the US will ratify the convention on the rights of the child anytime soon, Todres says. Or, that if it does so, it will implement it the same way Sweden has. But in the meantime, a handful of cities, including Portland, Oregon, and Santa Cruz, California, have adopted children’s bills of rights. And with children’s access to healthcare on the chopping block this year, it might be time to consider whether that access should be protected as a right.

"abortion","Pennsylvania keeps three liberal justices, preserving swing-state court control","Three liberal justices won another 10-year term on the Pennsylvania supreme court, giving Democrats a key victory and allowing them to maintain their 5-2 advantage on a vital body that could issue important rulings on abortion and voting rights in an important battleground state in the coming years. In Pennsylvania, supreme court justices are first elected in partisan elections and then voters get to decide whether to retain them every 10 years in contests that are technically non-partisan. Three justices – Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht – were elected as Democrats in 2015. The court since then has played a major role in election disputes, striking down the state’s severely gerrymandered map in 2018 and ruling in favor of Pennsylvania voters in disputes about mail-in ballot rules. Only one justice has not been retained in Pennsylvania since 1968. If Donohue, Dougherty, and Wecht had all been ousted, it could have led to a 2-2 court, with judges from other courts potentially rotating in, because a special election would not have taken place until 2027. The Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro could make interim appointments to fill the vacancies, but would have been extremely unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds support in the state senate. Judicial retention contests are typically low-turnout contests, but this year’s race in Pennsylvania saw an influx of attention and campaign cash. Spending in the race was set to exceed $15m, according to the Associated Press. In recent years, there has been a wider recognition on the immense power state supreme courts have to shape state policies and consequently more spending on their elections. Campaigns and outside groups spent more than $100m in a state supreme court election in Wisconsin earlier this year. Since state supreme courts often decide matters of election law, there is an intense focus on their composition in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina. Underscoring the importance of the contest, Donald Trump weighed in during the final days of the election and urged voters to vote against retention, calling Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht “radical supreme court justices”. Barack Obama urged voters to support retaining the justices, as did Shapiro and Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, who campaigned in the state ahead of the election.","2025-11-05T03:07:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/pennsylvania-supreme-court-election"
"abortion","US supreme court abortion pill hearing: key takeaways","Supreme court justices seemed to express skepticism towards arguments by a group of anti-abortion doctors in a case that could reshape the availability of medication abortion and undermine the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) authority. The supreme court heard oral arguments on Tuesday in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v FDA, the first abortion case to reach the supreme court since it overturned Roe v Wade almost two years ago. The court will decide whether a group of anti-abortion doctors could force the agency to roll back FDA decisions from 2016 and 2021 that expanded access to a common abortion pill, mifepristone. The pill is generally used as part of a two-drug regimen in medication abortions, which account for 63% of all US abortions. The justices will probably issue a decision by summer 2024, just months ahead of the US election – in which abortion is expected to be a major issue. Here are some key takeaways from Tuesday’s hearing: Even conservative justices expressed skepticism Conservative justices on the court hold a 6-3 majority. So, while all of the court’s liberal members appeared plainly dubious of the anti-abortion doctors’ claims, at least two conservatives must join them to avoid a decision in favor of anti-abortion doctors. Much of the argument focused on standing, or whether doctors had the right to sue in the first place, and whether the proposed remedy – rolling back the FDA’s authority to change how a drug is prescribed – went far beyond what was necessary to protect a small group of doctors who can already invoke federal conscience protections if they don’t want to provide abortion care in cases of exceedingly rare complications from mifepristone. Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the court’s conservatives, said he was uncertain why the best course of action was to roll back the FDA’s decision. Was throwing out FDA rules the equivalent of, “turning a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule, or any other federal government action?” Justice Amy Coney Barrett also spent a significant amount of time confirming that federal conscience laws already protect anti-abortion doctors. “So I just want to be clear, the federal government’s position is that ... such doctors would have recourse to the conscience protections of federal law?” she asked the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, who represented the FDA. Similarly, Justice Brett Kavanaugh sought reassurance. “Under federal law, no doctors can be forced against their consciences to perform or assist in an abortion, correct?” he asked Prelogar, who represented the FDA. Prelogar said that was correct, and that the government believed conscience laws provide “broad coverage here”. The court’s liberal justices also appeared dubious, with Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – the members of the court’s liberal wing – questioning the foundations of the case. Kagan asked Erin Hawley, the attorney for the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, whether she believed that the injuries she is “trying to prove” could be “traceable to the 2016 and 2021 actions you’re challenging … [that] these incidents are caused by whatever incremental increase in risk there is from the 2016 and 2021 actions”. Hawley told Kagan that the 2016 and 2021 actions, which among other things allowed mifepristone to be prescribed via telehealth and delivered by mail, “increased the risk of harm”. The FDA has found no significant safety concerns related to the changes. Jackson then questioned why doctors needed a remedy as broad as undermining the FDA’s authority and forcing a rollback of their evaluations. The case has a “significant mismatch” Jackson said, “between the claimed injury and the remedy that’s being sought ... They’re saying, ‘Because we object to being forced to participate in this procedure, we’re seeking an order preventing anyone from having access to these drugs at all.’” Jackson said she was trying to understand “how they could possibly be entitled to that, given the injury that they have alleged.” Oral arguments underscored the fears of the pharmaceutical industry Continually evaluating the safety and efficacy of a medication, and adjusting its regulations based on that evidence, are part of the FDA’s core duties. The pharmaceutical industry considers this case an existential threat, because if a court can roll back evidence-based prescribing changes, what stops judges from parsing science from the bench, even when they have no qualifications to do so? Two separate exchanges highlighted these fears. First, Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, asked why the agency didn’t provide a more comprehensive comment on increased emergency room visits from prescriptions of mifepristone via telehealth, which have been permitted by the FDA since 2021. “The increase in ER visits is just of no consequence? It doesn’t even merit some comment?” Alito asked Prelogar. To researchers, it was an obvious example of a proxy measure: emergency room visits might indicate the possibility of adverse events, but may also indicate only a woman seeking reassurance, particularly in connection with a drug like mifepristone which induces bleeding. This is exactly the kind of complicated parsing the FDA considers every day when looking at studies on the safety and efficacy of drugs. Similarly, Jackson gave Danco’s lawyer Jessica Ellsworth some space to explain why pharmaceutical companies have lined up in support of the FDA. Pharmaceutical companies have “significant concerns” about judges parsing science from the bench, Ellsworth said, because they rely on the “FDA’s gold standard review process”. “You have a district court that, among other things, relied on one study that was an analysis of anonymous blogposts,” said Ellsworth. Other studies “have since been retracted for lack of scientific rigor and misleading data”. “Precisely because judges are not experts in statistics and the methodologies used for studies in clinical trials – that is why FDA has many hundreds of pages of analysis in the record of what the scientific data showed, and courts are just not in a position to parse” and “second guess” that, she said. The most conservative justices want to talk about the Comstock Act Alito and Clarence Thomas, who make up the most conservative faction of the court, both brought up the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-obscenity law that bans mailing abortion-related materials. Although portions of the act are technically still on the books, the Comstock Act has long been regarded as an antique from another era of US history, as past court decisions narrowed its anti-obscenity provisions and Congress rolled back its restrictions on contraception. But now that Roe no longer provides a constitutional right to abortion, some anti-abortion activists claim the Comstock Act should be enforced and have seeded references to it in anti-abortion litigation, including the lawsuit over mifepristone. “How do you respond to an argument that mailing your product and advertising it would violate the Comstock Act?” Thomas asked Ellsworth. “I don’t believe that this case presents an opportunity for the court to opine on the reach of the statute,” Ellsworth replied, after some back and forth. Thomas may see this case as an invitation to do just that, as he has in the past taken the opportunity to write minority opinions with far-reaching arguments. In the case overturning Roe, Thomas’s opinion suggested the court should re-evaluate landmark cases establishing constitutional rights to same-sex marriage, same-sex intimacy and contraception. The Biden administration has issued guidance declaring that the Comstock Act only applies if someone intends to break the law. If fully enforced – such as by a future president Donald Trump – the Comstock Act would result in a nationwide de facto ban on abortion, legal experts have said, since abortion clinics, providers and patients rely heavily on the mail for equipment, medicine and other materials that are fundamental to providing care.","2024-03-26T20:24:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/supreme-court-abortion-pill-takeaways"
"abortion","Kamala Harris at Wisconsin rally: ‘Women have died because of Trump’s abortion bans’ – as it happened","We’re closing this blog. Thanks for tagging along! See all our coverage of the 2024 US elections. Here’s a look back at the day’s political news: Kamala Harris delivered her speech at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, where she highlighted the case of Amber Thurman, who died in Georgia due to a strict abortion ban. In Madison, Kamala Harris restated her plan to give a tax cut to 100 million Americans and expand the child tax credit. This measure aims “to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development”. Mark Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, will not attend Donald Trump’s rally on Saturday after CNN reported on his troubling online posts. Harris took the stage in Atlanta earlier today, where she also decried the state’s abortion ban. She condemned Donald Trump in her speech, recounting how he appointed three of the justices who would go on to vote for Roe v Wade’s downfall. Georgia’s election board voted to require that ballots be counted by hand, a move that could complicate and slow down determining whether the swing state has voted for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in the November election. The Secret Service report looking into the 13 July assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump revealed that agents did not have the necessary discussions in advance regarding how the warehouse should be guarded, and about the positioning of a local team on the roof of the warehouse building. The House unanimously approved allowing a bipartisan taskforce investigating the July assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump in Pennsylvania to also scrutinize the apparent second attempt on his life on Sunday in Florida. North Carolina’s Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, was still in the race for governor on Friday morning after the deadline passed overnight for him to withdraw or be removed from the ballot. He is facing increasing pressure to step down after CNN reported he attacked Martin Luther King Jr, backed the reinstatement of slavery and referred to himself as a “black Nazi” in comments on a pornographic website. Donald Trump is due to visit North Carolina tomorrow. When asked about the CNN report by the Associated Press, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not mention Robinson by name or answer questions as to whether he would appear with Trump at tomorrow’s campaign rally in Wilmington, or had been invited to do so. Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a “black Nazi” on a pornography website. Harris wrapped up her speech in Madison by reminding crowd members that “the stakes are even higher” in this election. “Wisconsin, it all comes down to this,” she said. “We are here together because we love our country. We love our country and we understand the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.” Kamala Harris then said Donald Trump poses a threat to women’s freedoms, specifically on abortion rights. She reminded folks in Madison about the former president’s selection of three members of the supreme court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade, which they did. “Women are being denied care during miscarriages,” Harris said. “They didn’t want this. And we know that women have died because of Trump’s abortion bans.” Harris told the story of Amber Nicole Thurman, a 28-year-old Georgia woman, who died after doctors hesitated to treat her following a complication from a medication abortion. Earlier today, Harris also recounted Thurman’s story during a speech in Georgia. Harris called her opponent Donald Trump “an unserious man”. “The consequences of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious,” she said. “Just Google Project 2025,” she added, referring to the Heritage Foundation-led policy blueprint for the next Republican administration. “It’s a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he were elected president,” she said. Project 2025 was written by a number of supporters as well as officials who previously served under the former president. The plan calls to defund childcare and overhaul the justice department to give the president and loyalists more power in decisions about who to investigate and prosecute. Talking about the economy, Harris said she also intends to lower the cost of living. “While our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday necessities like groceries are still too high,” said the vice-president. Harris restated her plan to give a tax cut to 100 million Americans and expand the child tax credit. This measure aims “to help young and new parents buy a car seat, a crib, baby clothes in that most significant phase of their development”. Harris addressed a pressing concern for Americans: affordable housing, particularly problematic in her home state of California. “We have a shortage of housing in America,” she said. “With my plan, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.” She pointed to her plan to provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000 in down payment assistance so “they can just get their foot in the door.” Harris pointed to her professional background as a prosecutor in Oakland, California. “I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them,” Harris said. “I took on the big banks and delivered $20bn for middle-class families who faced foreclosure because of predatory lending practices. “I stood up for veterans and students who were being scammed by the big for-profit colleges, and for workers who are being cheated out of the wages they were due, and for seniors facing elder abuse.” The vice-president then addressed concerns for small business owners. She addressed last week’s debate against Donald Trump, an event filled with falsehood-ridden tangents about crowd sizes, abortion access and immigration policy. It was the same old tired show, the same old tired playbook we’ve heard for years with no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people “Folks, it’s time to turn the page, and America is ready to start a new way forward,” Harris said during her speech in Madison, Wisconsin. “Let’s not pay too much attention to the polls, because let’s be clear, we are the underdog in this race,” Harris said. She pointed to her parents’ teaching stint at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “So every time I land, the governor says: “Welcome home,” she said. Kamala Harris has started her speech at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin. The last time the vice-president held a rally in Wisconsin was last month at Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum, with her running mate Tim Walz tagging along. Aaron Sorkin, the creator of The West Wing, took the stage at the White House to celebrate the TV show’s 25th anniversary and called Joe Biden’s decision to give up the nomination “a selfless act of statesmanship”. “Over the years, I’ve noticed that during times of political tension, pundits will warn us not to expect a West Wing moment,” Sorkin said. “They mean not to expect a selfless act of statesmanship, not to expect anyone to put country first. Don’t expect anyone to swing for the fences or reach for the stars. “But the fact is, West Wing moments do happen, and Dr Biden, we saw proof of that on the morning of July 21. That was the kind of thing we write stories about.” Mark Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, will not attend Donald Trump’s rally on Saturday after CNN reported on his troubling online posts. His absence shows the risks he poses for Trump and other GOP candidates. According to the Associated Press, Robinson is not expected to be at the Wilmington event. He has often joined Trump at campaign stops, and Trump has praised him, even calling him “Martin Luther King on steroids”. The Trump campaign issued a statement that didn’t mention Robinson, but spoke generally about how North Carolina was key to the campaign’s efforts. Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s governor, told Bloomberg TV that the recent allegations against North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson aren’t surprising. Cooper said that the allegations may help Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris win the state” He has a history of these kinds of inflammatory comments. We’ve known for a while that he was someone who was unfit for office. In a similar vein, Bill Carroll, Milwaukee-based Teamsters Joint Council 39 president, will introduce Kamala Harris at Wisconsin’s rally tonight, according to CNN. This comes two days after the local union endorsed Harris for president, breaking with the national union’s decision not to back a candidate in the 2024 race. Carroll called Harris the vice president “of the most pro-union administration ever” and criticized Trump’s labor record. The Pennsylvania Conference of Teamsters has endorsed the vice-president Kamala Harris after the national Teamsters union chose not to back any candidate in the presidential race. The national union’s decision was seen as a setback for Harris, while Donald Trump saw it as a win for himself. But the endorsement from Pennsylvania’s 95,000 Teamsters, which also includes members from parts of New Jersey and Delaware, could be a strong show of labor support in a key swing state. The PA Conference of Teamsters is committed to vetting candidates and choosing those that are best suited to protect our members’ wages, their rights and their collective bargaining agreements,” said William Hamilton, president of the PA Conference of Teamsters. Kamala Harris, the vice-president, outspent the former President Donald Trump on digital ads, especially on Facebook and Instagram, during their debate week, spending $12.2m compared with Trump’s $611,228, according to The New York Times. This gap has been constant throughout the campaign, raising concerns among Republicans. Harris’s heavy spending in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan highlights her campaign’s aggressive digital strategy. While Trump focuses more on YouTube ads and other digital media, his lighter investment in paid digital advertising could limit his reach. This digital spending difference has prompted Democratic optimism, especially as social media plays a crucial role in engaging undecided and younger voters. Nebraska Republicans are considering changing how the state distributes its electoral votes to block the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, from getting any votes in the next presidential election. Unlike most states, Nebraska and Maine don’t give all their electoral votes to the statewide winner. Nebraska gives two votes to the statewide winner and one vote for each of its three congressional districts. The second congressional district, which includes Omaha and nearby areas, has leaned more Democratic since Donald Trump’s 2016 election. In 2020, Joe Biden won the district by 6.5%, and polls show Harris with a similar lead. Dawn Roberts, the co-chair of former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s campaign in Iowa, said she’s endorsing Kamala Harris for president. In an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register, Roberts said Harris impressed her and earned her support through her strong debate performance during the Democratic national convention. The lifelong Republican said she was “at a loss” when both of the presidential candidates were in or near their 80s, referring to President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. “At this month’s debate, she continued to impress, looking at the audience and emphasizing bringing the country together rather than dividing, lifting people up rather than tearing people down,” Roberts said. Rally-goers are trickling into a Madison, Wisconsin, venue to hear Kamala Harris speak later this evening. There are plenty of young faces here – a positive sign for the campaign, which hopes that college-age voters will help deliver Harris a win in November. According to a source familiar with the Harris campaign, the Democratic-led effort, which advocates for candidates up and down the ballot, has hired seven full-time campus organizers across the state and a youth-organizing director to aid in the effort – part of the campaign’s 250 staffers across the state. Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine, expressed his disappointment at negative rhetoric around immigration and Haitian migrants, especially from former president Donald Trump and the Republican vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, in an opinion piece for the New York Times. He wrote about his personal connection to Springfield, Ohio, and the city’s recent economic resurgence thanks to Haitian migrants. There have been language barriers and cultural differences, but these Haitians come to work every day, are fitting in with co-workers and have become valuable employees. He stressed the need to address a slew of challenges, such as housing and healthcare. “Their work will continue long after this fall’s election is over and the national spotlight turns away from Springfield,” DeWine said, referring to immigrants in the city. “But in the meantime, our people and our history deserve better than to be falsely portrayed.” If you’re just joining us now, here’s what’s happened in US politics today so far: Georgia’s election board has voted to require that ballots be counted by hand, a move that could complicate and slow down determining whether the swing state has voted for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in the November election. The Secret Service report looking into the 13 July assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump revealed that agents did not have the necessary discussions in advance regarding how the warehouse should be guarded, and about the positioning of a local team on the roof of the warehouse building. Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe Jr said that recent events such as the attempted assassination in July and apparent attempted assassination of the former president on Sunday in Florida highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the how the Secret Service protects public officials and said that the “threat level is evolving”. The House unanimously approved allowing a bipartisan taskforce investigating the July assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump in Pennsylvania to also scrutinize the apparent second attempt on his life on Sunday in Florida. Kamala Harris took the stage in Atlanta, where she decried the state’s abortion ban, which was recently tied to the death of a woman in 2022. Harris condemned Donald Trump in her speech, recounting how he appointed three of the justices who would go on to vote for Roe v Wade’s downfall. North Carolina’s Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, was still in the race for governor on Friday morning after the deadline passed overnight for him to withdraw or be removed from the ballot. He is facing increasing pressure to step down after CNN reported he attacked Martin Luther King Jr, backed the reinstatement of slavery and referred to himself as a “black Nazi” in comments on a pornographic website. Donald Trump is due to visit North Carolina tomorrow. When asked about the CNN report by the Associated Press, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not mention Robinson by name or answer questions as to whether he would appear with Trump at tomorrow’s campaign rally in Wilmington, or had been invited to do so. Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a “black Nazi” on a pornography website. Before Harris wrapped up her speech, she said she believed Donald Trump would sign a national abortion ban, if elected. Trump has equivocated on whether or not he would do so, saying at the debate last week that he did not think any such legislation would get through Congress. Harris said: The stakes are so high, because if he is elected again, I am certain he will sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every single state, and he would create a national anti-abortion coordinator. Look at Project 2025 – enforce states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions. It’s right there. Kamala Harris then recounted her meeting with Amber Nicole Thurman’s mother, who asked her not to forget who her daughter was: Through the pain and the grief, her mother courageously told her story. I promised her, as she has asked, that we will make sure Amber is not just remembered as a statistic, that she will not just be remembered as a statistic, so that people will know she was a mother and a daughter and a sister, and that she was loved and that she should be alive today. She drew applause by saying that, as president, she would stand with women elsewhere who were suffering the consequences of abortion bans: It’s happening every day in our country, an untold number of people suffering, women, who are also being made to feel as though they did something wrong. The judgment factor here is outrageous, being made as though to feel as though they are criminals, as though they are alone. So to those women, to those families, I say on behalf of what I believe we all say: we see you, and you are not alone, and we are all here standing with you. Harris added that by appointing the justices who overturned Roe v Wade, Trump created a public health crisis: This is a healthcare crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of this crisis. Harris then began discussing the case of Amber Nicole Thurman, who ProPublica reported earlier this week died after being denied care due to the state’s abortion ban. “We will speak her name, Amber Nicole Thurman,” Harris said, as the crowd repeated her name back. The vice-president then made the case that Trump was responsible for her death: When she discovered that she was pregnant, she decided she wanted to have an abortion. But because of the Trump abortion ban here in Georgia, she was forced to travel out of state to receive the healthcare that she needed, but when she returned to Georgia, she needed additional care, so she went to a hospital. But you see, under the Trump abortion ban, her doctors could have faced up to a decade in prison for providing Amber the care she needed. Understand what a law like this means: doctors have to wait until the patient is at death’s door before they take action. Kamala Harris said lawmakers who have moved to ban abortion in their states while ignoring the needs of mothers are “hypocrites”: One in three women in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. This includes Georgia and every state in the south except Virginia. Think about that, when you also combine that with what we know has been longstanding neglect around an issue like maternal mortality. Think about that, when you compound that with what has been longstanding neglect of women in communities with a lack of the adequate resources they need for healthcare, prenatal, during their pregnancy, postpartum. Think about that, and these hypocrites want to start talking about this is in the best interest of women and children? As the crowd cheered, Harris said: “Well, where you been? Where you been when it comes to taking care of the women and children of America, where you been? How dare they?” Harris immediately hit out at Donald Trump, recounting how he appointed three of the justices who would go on to vote for Roe v Wade’s downfall, which paved the way for states like Georgia to enact bans on abortion. “We all know how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States supreme court, the court of Thurgood and RBG, with the intention that they would overturn the protections of Roe v Wade,” Harris said. She continued: And as he intended, they did, and now more than 20 states have Trump abortion bans, extremists that have passed laws that criminalize healthcare providers, doctors and nurses, and punish women. In two of those states, they provide for prison for life – prison for life – for healthcare providers for simply providing reproductive care, the care they so earnestly and rightly believe must be delivered – all Trump abortion bans. And think about this: many of these bans make no exception, even for rape and incest. Kamala Harris just took the stage in Atlanta, where she is expected to decry the state’s abortion ban, which was recently tied to the death of a woman in 2022, and Donald Trump’s support for the overturning of Roe v Wade. We may also hear from the vice-president about the election board’s rule change today that could slow down the vote-counting process in the battleground state. Here’s more about the death of Amber Nicole Thurman, which Harris blamed on Trump: Residents of Virginia, South Dakota and Minnesota have hit the polls for early voting today, as the 2024 election gets underway. While the bulk of voters will cast ballots on 5 November, the three states are the first to open their polls, and more will follow throughout October, the Associated Press reports. In the weeks to come, millions more Americans will cast absentee ballots by mail. Here’s more on that: Kevin Moncla, a prominent election denier, is holding court on the marble steps just outside the Georgia state board of elections hearing room at the state capitol. Moncla described how state election officials had given him the cold shoulder after the 2020 election. Moncla and fellow activist Joe Rossi filed a complaint alleging that Fulton county had covered up mass election fraud with multiple duplicate ballots, missing ballot images and missing documents. Applause from their supporters occasionally bleeds into the hearing room. Their backers from Georgians for Truth are wearing white T-shirts printed with the words “Paper Please.” Here’s more on Moncla: The House just unanimously approved allowing a bipartisan taskforce investigating the July assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump in Pennsylvania to also scrutinize the apparent second attempt on his life on Sunday in Florida. “There’s no leader in American history who has been attacked as aggressively as Donald Trump, and yet remained so strong and resilient,” the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said in a statement after the vote. “Today, the House is rising to meet this historic moment by voting to formally expand the purview of the taskforce to include the second assassination attempt on his life. The American people deserve answers and accountability for the many security failures that have led to these events – and this Congress will deliver.” Earlier, the House unanimously approved the bipartisan Enhanced Presidential Security Act, which would establish universal standards for Secret Service protectees such as the president, former presidents and candidates for the White House, and require a comprehensive review of the agency’s current protection strategy. Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe Jr said on Friday that recents events such as the attempted assassination in July and apparent attempted assassination of the former president on Sunday in Florida, highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the how the Secret Service protects public officials and said that the “threat level is evolving.” The Secret Service report states that the site of the rally, the Butler farm show, was seen by the Secret Service and local law enforcement partners “as a challenge”. The summary of the report reads: Advance personnel and multiple supervisors with oversight of the security plan at the Butler farm show venue recognized line of site concerns. However, the security measures to alleviate these concerns were not carried out on July 13, 2024, as intended. There was a lack of detailed knowledge by Secret Service personnel regarding the state or local law enforcement presence that would be present in and around the AGR complex. There was also a lack of knowledge regarding the specific footprint of resources that would buttress the secure area of the venue and separate it from the AGR complex, which was outside of the site’s secure perimeter. The Secret Service report looking into the 13 July assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump also revealed that agents did not have the necessary discussions in advance regarding how the warehouse should be guarded, and about the positioning of a local team on the roof of the warehouse building, according to the report’s executive summary. Another issue that arose on 13 July, according to the report, was that the Secret Service’s aerial system was experiencing “technical difficulties”. It is possible that if the system had “functioned properly” the “shooter may have been detected as he flew his drone near the Butler farm show venue earlier in the day”, the summary reads. In a news conference on Friday, the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe Jr, said that the findings of the report have prompted the agency to “move into the accountability phase of this process”. “As a result of these failures, what has become clear to me is we need a shift in paradigm in how we conduct our protective operations,” he added. The Secret Service report released on Friday highlights several shortcomings in the security and preparation of the 13 July rally in Pennsylvania. It states some local police officers at the rally were unaware of the existence of two communications centers on the grounds, the Associated Press reported, meaning that officers did not know that the Secret Service were not receiving their radio transmissions. The report adds that law enforcement officers were communicating important information outside the Secret Service’s radio frequencies, per the AP, which resulted in details being transmitted “via mobile/cellular devices in staggered or fragmented fashion” instead of through the Secret Service’s own network. A Secret Service report looking into the events leading up to the July assassination attempt on the former president was released on Friday, and, according to the Associated Press, found fault with both local and federal law enforcement in the run-up to the Pennsylvania rally where a gunman fired at Donald Trump, injuring him and others, and killing a rally attendee. The report details a series of “communications deficiencies” before the shooting occurred, and states that the Secret Service knew even before the shooting that the site of the rally posed a security challenge. “It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13 and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another mission failure like this again,” the Secret Service’s acting director, Ronald Rowe Jr, said in a statement. Georgia’s election board has voted to require that ballots be counted by hand, a move that could complicate and slow down determining whether the swing state has voted for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump in the November election. The decision, made after Trump-aligned members gained a majority on the board, comes despite a warning from the state attorney general that such a rule would be illegal. The meeting is ongoing, with the election board voting down a proposal to require the hand counting of early voting ballots. We will let you know what else they decide. Here’s what else is happening today: In an interview with Oprah, Harris, a gun owner, said: “If somebody breaks into my house they’re getting shot.” Democratic state lawmakers denounced the Georgia election board’s rule change with a press conference held in sight of Trump supporters. CNN reported that Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina has a history of lewd and offensive statements online. Will he appear with Trump during his rally tomorrow? The former president’s campaign won’t say. Opponents of the Georgia election board’s rule change rallied in the state capitol in Atlanta as the body met. But supporters of Donald Trump were not far away: The Georgia state election board just voted 4-1 to table a proposal that would have required hand-counting ballots during early voting. The decision to delay came after member Janelle King raised concerns that people hand-counting the ballots could potentially leak information about who was ahead in certain precincts. Anticipating that this election was going to be contentious, King said she did not want to get the rule wrong. The only member to vote in favor of the rule was Janice Johnston. The state attorney general had advised the board that this rule was likely illegal. The Georgia state election board was advised by the attorney general’s office that the decision to hand-count ballots was likely illegal. “The statutes upon which these rules rely do not reflect any provision enacted by the general assembly for the hand-counting of ballots prior to tabulation,” it said. “There are thus no provisions in the statutes cited in support of these proposed rules that permit counting the number of ballots by hand at the precinct level prior to delivery to the election superintendent for tabulation. Accordingly, these proposed rules are not tethered to any statute – and are, therefore, likely the precise type of impermissible legislation that agencies cannot do,” the attorney general’s office wrote in a memo. The Georgia state election board approved a rule requiring election workers to hand-count ballots on election night. The vote was three in favor, and two opposed. The three Republicans who voted in favor of the proposal were all praised by name by Donald Trump during an August rally as “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory”. The board’s lone Democrat, Sara Tindall Ghazal, and John Fervier, a Republican who serves as the board’s chair, voted against the proposal. The concern among voting advocates and local election officials is that the rule will delay the reporting of election results and open the door for chaos after the presidential vote. It could also make it harder to determine whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins the state’s electoral votes in the November election. Hand counts, long favored by those who question the results of the 2020 election, have been shown to be slower and less reliable than machine counts. The Guardian has obtained a memo from the Georgia attorney general’s office advising the state election board that several of the rules it is voting on today are illegal. “A review of the proposed rules reveals several issues including that several of the proposed rules, if passed, very likely exceed the board’s statutory authority and in some instances appear to conflict with the statutes governing the conduct of elections. Where such is the case, and as outlined below, the board risks passing rules that may easily be challenged and determined to be invalid,” the letter says. Sara Tindall Ghazal, a Democrat on the state election board, just had a back-and-forth with Sharlene Alexander, a Republican on the Fayette county election board, over whether her proposal to count ballots by hand was feasible. Ghazal noted that no local election officials had told her they supported the rule. Alexander and other Republicans have framed the rule as something that will be a minimal burden to implement. The board is about to vote on a proposal to require hand-counting of ballots on election night. Janice Johnston, a Republican on the board, just went through a lengthy recitation of election rules that were adopted close to an election. She’s trying to rebut criticism from election officials that it’s too close to the election to adopt new rules. “The hue and cry about how early or how late it is to adopt these rules, I don’t buy. Rulemaking is good any month of the year.” We’re now beginning the part of the meeting during which the board is going to consider rules. First up is perhaps the most controversial change it is considering today: a rule that would require election workers to hand-count ballots on election night. Sharlene Alexander, a member of the board of elections in Fayette county, is presenting the rule and says she doesn’t understand why it’s so controversial – it’s just checking the machine counts. Earlier this morning, election officials and poll workers warned against this rule, saying it’s not needed and would only delay tabulation of election results. One of the speakers who really stuck out to me this morning was Milton Kidd, the election director in Douglas county, Georgia. He was one of half a dozen local election officials to urge the state election board not to enact rules so close to the election. But Kidd also pointed out that the volunteer board – whose members are not election experts – was ignoring the advice of seasoned election experts. “The idea that you’re not going to listen to the individuals that are charged with conducting elections is absurd to me,” he said. “Most of us have worked decades in these career paths, and to say that we don’t know what we’re talking about, you wouldn’t say that to any other professional.” “I’ve stayed at a lot of Waffle Houses in my life, but that does not qualify me to operate a Waffle House,” he added. We’re now wrapping up the morning public comment session of this meeting. The overwhelming majority of speakers have urged the board not to adopt the proposed rules, including around half a dozen local election officials who have spoken. We’re expecting to move on to discussion of the actual new rules shortly. Travis Doss, executive director of the Richmond county board of elections in Augusta and the president of the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials, urged the board to stop its rulemaking. “Now is simply not the time to implement sweeping changes that could create unnecessary confusion and disruption,” he said. He noted that in previous elections – the 2018 gubernatorial race and the 2020 presidential race – Stacey Abrams and Donald Trump, respectively, said last-minute changes contributed to their loss. He didn’t mention her by name, but Doss at one point seemed to be appealing directly to Janice Johnston, a retired OB/GYN who is leading the Republican bloc on the board. He said what the board was doing was akin to making changes during the third trimester of pregnancy. Brook Schreiner, the election director in Butts county, Georgia, is the first election official to testify at today’s meeting. Local election officials throughout the state have strongly objected to the way the board has pushed through election rules. “While we do not oppose many of the rules being processed, the timing could certainly be improved,” she said. She also laid out how a proposal to hand-count ballots in local precincts “would unnecessarily delay election day tabulation”. She noted that poll managers already have a litany of tasks on election night, including sealing ballots and transporting memory cards. We’re now beginning the public comment section of the meeting, which is expected last at least an hour. John Fervier, the board’s chairman, called it his favorite portion of the meeting, which may have been said somewhat tongue-in-cheek. The Georgia state election board meeting has only been under way for a few minutes and you can already see the two factions on the board at work. Janice Johnston, the state GOP’s representative on the board, went back and forth with John Fervier, the board chair, over two last-minute additions to the agenda. One was to add a petition for rulemaking to the agenda, which Fervier objected to because he said the board hadn’t had proper time to consider it. Johnston and two other members of the conservative bloc overruled Fervier’s attempt to block the petition from the agenda. Johnston has seen a meteoric rise from being a citizen activist to essentially being in control of the three-member majority on the board. As the Georgia state board of elections convened, Janice Johnston asked the board to amend the agenda to allow a petition for a rule change proposed by Salleigh Grubbs, chairman of the Cobb county GOP, regarding the storage of ballots after the November election. “We are talking about debating a rule that no member of the public has seen,” said member Sara Tindall Ghazal. The proposed rule was submitted to the board a few weeks ago, board member Janice Johnston said “Adding the petition at the last minute is not the responsible thing to do,” said chairman John Fervier, noting that the board members could have asked for alterations ahead of the meeting. Three board members overruled the chairman’s objection. The three – Johnston, Janelle King and Rick Jeffares – were praised by name by Donald Trump at a rally a few months ago. Here’s more on what the board is considering today, and why it could matter to the outcome of the presidential vote in the state: Members of Georgia’s state election board held a short press conference ahead of their 9am meeting this morning. Board member Janelle King asserted that “county board members have always had the right to certify or not to certify”, a statement at odds with legal holdings that the act of certification is “ministerial” and obligatory. “It is not ministerial. It is an option. It is an option because of the legal document each must sign,” King said. The question of delayed certification is at the heart of objections raised by Democratic lawmakers, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, which are suing the state board of elections to prevent rules they believe will delay certification and potentially create a controversy that denies Georgia voters their delegates in the electoral vote after the November election. Board member Janice Johnston encouraged Georgians to vote early and in person, instead of mailing absentee ballots this election, citing delays in mail delivery reported in the Atlanta area. She noted that – with the exception of military ballots – absentee ballots must be at the local election office by 7pm on election day. Those who “desire to use absentee voting, please return the voting ballot directly to the election office”, she said. “If you must rely on the surface mail, please send your voting ballot as early as possible.” Kamala Harris, who recently reminded the public that she owns a gun, told Oprah during their interview yesterday that “if somebody breaks into my house, they’re getting shot”. Here’s the moment: Harris acknowledged owning a weapon as early as 2019, and mentioned it again during her debate with Donald Trump last week. Her comment to Oprah appeared to be a somewhat rare instance of the relentlessly on-message vice-president slipping: “Probably should not have said that,” Harris said afterwards. The Democrats have moved to capitalize on CNN’s story yesterday finding that Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor in North Carolina, has a history of posting lewd and offensive statements online, including referring to himself as a “black Nazi”. The Democratic National Committee bought billboards in Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro that show Donald Trump with Robinson, and include quotes from the former president about him, including “we have to cherish Mark”. North Carolina is a swing state Democrats are hoping to pick up this year, and Trump will campaign in the city of Wilmington on Saturday. “Make no mistake: Trump has embraced and tied himself to Robinson at every turn. Donald Trump and Mark Robinson are too extreme for North Carolina,” Democratic national committee chair Jaime Harrison said. Joe Biden, in the final months of his term, will meet with his cabinet to “discuss a range of administration priorities” today, the White House said. Democrats controlled Congress for the first two years of Biden’s presidency, working with him to pass several significant pieces of legislation addressing climate change, prescription drug prices and the nation’s infrastructure needs, although he did not get everything he wanted passed. That all ended when the GOP took control of the House of Representatives in 2023, and it remains to be seen what more Biden can accomplish before he departs the White House in January of 2025. Perhaps we’ll find out after the meeting at 11.30am ET, where first lady Jill Biden will also provide an update on her initiative to improve women’s health research. Biden will then fly to Wilmington, Delaware, where he will meet with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese in what the White House says is a “personal meeting”. Labelling tweets featuring false claims about election fraud as “disputed” does little to nothing to change Trump voters’ pre-existing beliefs, and it may make them more likely to believe the lies, according to a new study. The study, authored by John Blanchard, an assistant professor from the University of Minnesota, Duluth, and Catherine Norris, an associate professor from Swarthmore College, looked at data from a sampling of 1,072 Americans surveyed in December of 2020. The researchers published a peer-reviewed paper on their findings this month in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review. “These ‘disputed’ tags are meant to alert a reader to false/misinformation, so it’s shocking to find that they may have the opposite effect,” Norris said. Participants were shown four tweets from Donald Trump that made false claims about election fraud and told to rank them from one to seven based on their truthfulness. A control group saw the tweets without “disputed” tags; the experimental group viewed them with the label. Before and after seeing the tweets, the subjects were also asked to rank their views on election fraud overall. The study found that Trump voters who were initially skeptical about claims of widespread fraud were more likely to rate lies as true when a “disputed” label appeared next to Trump’s tweets. The findings meanwhile showed Biden voters’ beliefs were largely unaffected by the “disputed” tags. You can read the full story here: Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he hopes Joe Biden will support his plan to end the war with Russia, ahead of a trip to Washington. Zelenskyy has promised to present his so-called “victory plan” to end the fighting, which has killed thousands, to Biden in the coming days, Agence France-Presse reports. “I really hope that he will support this plan,” Zelenskyy said during a press conference with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv. “The plan is designed for decisions that will have to happen from October to December … We would like that very much. Then we believe that the plan will work,” he added. Zelenskyy will present the plan to the US after a summer of intense fighting, with Moscow advancing in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv holding on to parts of Russia’s Kursk region. The Ukrainian leader is due to meet Biden and Kamala Harris – while Kyiv also says he plans to meet Donald Trump. Trump has not confirmed their meeting but says it will “probably” take place. Reuters reports that while Trump and Zelenskyy talked over the phone in July, they have not talked in person since Trump was president. The Republican nominee has consistently described US aid to its eastern European ally as a waste of money and has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win. Donald Trump’s sweeping threats if he wins the presidency again to name a special prosecutor to “go after” Joe Biden and take legal action against other foes would subvert the rule of law in America and take the country towards authoritarianism, former justice department officials and scholars have warned. Trump’s escalating legal threats have targeted “corrupt election officials”, lawyers, donors and others he falsely deems out to steal November’s presidential election, and have popped up variously on his Truth Social platform, at campaign events and at an elite police group he addressed this month in North Carolina. Trump’s menacing pledges to essentially weaponize the justice department against opponents would mark a sharp break with the Department of Justice’s mission statement, which cites as core values “independence and impartiality”. Ex-justice officials warn that Trump’s barrage of intimidating verbal assaults are unprecedented, and suggest he would undermine longstanding traditions of justice department independence if he wins the presidency, thus badly undermining the rule of law. You can read the full story here During the event with Kamala Harris and Oprah Winfrey last night, the family of Amber Nicole Thurman, a Georgia woman who died as a result of the state’s abortion ban, blamed Donald Trump and his supreme court picks for her death. “They just let her die because of some stupid abortion ban. They treated her like she was just another number,” Thurman’s older sister said of the medical professionals she had turned to for help. Associated Press have more on the abortion issue ahead of Kamala Harris’ speech in Georgia. About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their vote – but it’s more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About six in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about four in 10 male voters. The gender gap doesn’t stop there. About six in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about two in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters, by contrast, trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris. Kamala Harris will be in Georgia today and is expected to speak about Donald Trump’s role in the abortion bans that now blanket much of the United States, days after news broke that two Georgia mothers died after being unable to access legal abortions and adequate medical care. The deaths of the Georgia mothers, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, were first reported earlier this week by ProPublica and occurred as a result of Georgia enacting a six-week abortion ban. Georgia’s maternal mortality review committee looked at both women’s cases and deemed their deaths “preventable”, according to ProPublica. Although Georgia permits abortions in medical emergencies, doctors across the country have said that abortion exceptions are worded so vaguely as to be unworkable. Instead, doctors have said, they are forced to watch until patients get sick enough to legally intervene. Last night, Shanette Williams, Thurman’s mother, joined a virtual event hosted by Oprah Winfrey where she interviewed Harris. Williams told the audience: You’re looking at a mother that is broken, the worst pain ever that a mother, that a parent can ever feel. Harris responded: “I’m just so sad. And the courage that you all have shown is extraordinary.” Many in the studio audience of about 400 were in tears. Donald Trump is due to visit North Carolina tomorrow. It comes as his presidential campaign is rocked by the allegations against the state’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, Mark Robinson, that he attacked Martin Luther King Jr, backed the reinstatement of slavery and referred to himself as a “black Nazi” in comments on a pornographic website. When asked about the CNN report by Associated Press, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt did not mention Robinson by name or answer questions as to whether he would appear with Trump at tomorrow’s campaign rally in Wilmington, or had been invited to do so. The Georgia state election board is set to meet later today to consider another round of last-minute election changes that could cause delays and confusion after election day in the critical battleground state. The Republican majority on the board is expected to approve a rule that would require three people in every precinct to check machine-vote tallies by hand-counting the election results. Voting experts have long warned that hand-counts are time consuming, costly, and less reliable than machines. It’s a process that nonetheless has been favored by conservative activists who doubt the results of the 2020 election. The board will also consider proposed rules that would mandate daily hand-counts of early votes, require public reports of voters who have cast a ballot during early voting, allow for greater poll-watcher access during tabulation, distinguish emergency and mail-in ballots, and require that ballots be tracked through the mail. Read the full story here Also appearing tonight with Donald Trump and Monica Crowley in Arizona will be Chad Wolf, former acting secretary of homeland security when Trump was president. A report by the office of the Department for Homeland Security inspector general released in 2022 found that Wolf interfered with a report on Russian interference in the 2020 election by demanding changes, delaying its dissemination and creating a risk the report might be seen as politicised. Following the release of the report, Wolf told NBC News the watchdog “did not find any credible evidence that I directed anyone to change the substance of the report because it ‘made President Trump look bad’”. Turning away from the Robinson allegations momentarily we can look ahead to Donald Trump’s town hall event in the swing state of Arizona this evening. The Republican nominee will appear alongside Monica Crowley, who was accused of plagiarism over her book, What the (Bleep) Just Happened? Crowley has denied the claims and the then Trump administration at the time referred to them as a politically motivated attack. As we have said, Donald Trump did not comment on the Mark Robinson allegations during last night’s speech to a group of Jewish donors and to the Israeli-American Council in Washington. His campaign issued a statement about the CNN story that did not even mention Robinson, saying instead that Trump “is focused on winning the White House and saving this country” and that North Carolina was a “vital part of that plan.” The story also could threaten Donald Trump’s chances of winning North Carolina, a key battleground state, Associated Press reports. It says that Mark Robinson was already already running well behind his Democratic opponent in public polls before CNN claimed he referred to himself as a “black Nazi” on a pornographic website. “This story is not about the governor’s race in North Carolina. It’s about the presidential race,” said Paul Shumaker, a Republican pollster. He warned that Trump could risk losing a state he won in 2016 and 2020. The question is going to be, does Mark Robinson cost Donald Trump the White House?” Shumaker added. Recent polls of North Carolina voters show Trump and Kamala Harris locked in a close race. The same polls show Democrat Josh Stein with a roughly 10-point lead over Robinson in the race to be governor. At least one North Carolina Republican, US Representative Richard Hudson, called CNN’s reporting “very concerning”, Reuters reports. He said he thought Robinson needed to do more to reassure voters the allegations were untrue. Josh Stein, his opponent, has featured some of Robinson‘s previous controversial comments in television attack ads and his campaign issued a statement condemning him yesterday. Stein’s campaign said: North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be governor. Josh remains focused on winning this campaign so that together we can build a safer, stronger North Carolina for everyone.” As our story on the CNN claims states, Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s first Black lieutenant governor, is facing the Democrat Josh Stein, the state attorney general, in November. Republicans have reportedly been pressuring Robinson to withdraw from the race as rumors swirled about CNN’s story. North Carolina’s deadline for a candidate to drop out was yesterday and the deadline to remove his name from the ballot has passed. Good morning and welcome to our blog covering US politics in the run-up to the presidential election following another tumultuous evening where Donald Trump bemoaned a lack of support from Jewish voters just hours after allegations emerged that a Republican ally had referred to himself as a “black Nazi” on a pornography website. Trump failed to mention the claims in a CNN report against Mark Robinson, North Carolina’s Republican gubernatorial nominee, during a speech on Thursday at the Israeli-American Council national summit in Washington. In his speech, the former president lamented that he was trailing Kamala Harris among American Jews. Israel would likely cease to exist within two years should Harris win the election, and Jews would be partly to blame for that outcome because they tend to vote for Democrats, Trump argued. If I don’t win this election - and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that if that happens because if 40%, I mean, 60% of the people are voting for the enemy - Israel, in my opinion, will cease to exist within two years. Trump was citing a poll that he said showed Harris polling at 60% among American Jews. You can read our report on his speech here. Meanwhile, according to CNN’s reporting, Robinson referred to himself as a “perv” in archived messages because he “enjoyed watching transgender pornography”. The messages were made between 2008 and 2012 on “Nude Africa”, a pornographic website that includes a message board. He also allegedly expressed support for reinstating slavery. “Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it [slavery] back. I would certainly buy a few,” he wrote in October 2010. In March 2012, during the Obama administration, it was claimed he wrote: “I’d take Hitler over any of the shit that’s in Washington right now!” CNN reported that Robinson, who would be North Carolina’s first Black governor, also attacked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr in searing terms and once referred to himself as a “black Nazi”. Robinson has denied the report: “Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story – those are not the words of Mark Robinson” he said on a video posted to X. And said he is staying in the race. The North Carolina Republican party is standing by him. “Mark Robinson has categorically denied the allegations made by CNN but that won’t stop the Left from trying to demonize him via personal attacks,” the party said in a statement. After allegations against Robinson became public, the Harris campaign posted video clips of Trump praising the candidate. More on this story later. In other news: Harris sat down with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday for a “virtual rally” that included a wide-ranging sit-down interview, during which Harris attacked Trump’s stance on reproductive rights and pledged to sign a border security bill thwarted by Senate Republicans. On Friday, the vice-president will be attending campaign events in the swing states of Georgia and Wisconsin. In the evening, Trump will be in another swing state – Arizona –at a town hall event. He will appear alongside Monica Crowley, a commentator and former assistant secretary for public affairs, and Chad Wolf, who was an acting secretary for public affairs in his administration.","2024-09-21T00:10:50Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/20/donald-trump-mark-robinson-kamala-harris-us-politics-live"
"abortion","Our hard-won rights are being erased one letter at a time","I type this through nervous laughter but, haha, should we all be learning how to perform abortions? Just in case? Should we all perhaps, have a little stash of mifepristone in our makeup bags, a secret number in our phone? Something is happening in the US that requires our attention. Hard-earned rights are being erased and the speed at which history is being rewritten there does not bode well for our freedoms here. We are already seeing dark reflections in the glass. This month the Observer reported how British anti-abortion campaigners are echoing US vice-president JD Vance. He claimed our new buffer zone laws, preventing protests outside abortion clinics, were an attack on the “liberties of religious Britons”, shifting focus away from the reason they were implemented to a debate about freedom of speech. Buffer zones (intended to protect staff and women using the clinics) are being targeted in a careful campaign by conservative Christian groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a group that wants to ban abortion, opposes same-sex marriage and, in the US, has helped at least 23 states pass legislation barring trans athletes from girls’ and women’s events as well as drafting legislation restricting gender-affirming treatment for minors. With only 1.4% of adolescents in the US identifying as transgender, LGBTQ+ rights groups accused the ADF of “whipping up a panic” over decisions better left to doctors, teachers and parents. Then, on Thursday afternoon two weeks ago, the word “transgender” and the letter T in LGBTQ+ was removed from the National Park Service’s Stonewall National Monument website. This was particularly shocking for those familiar with the Stonewall Riots in 1969, a time when being gay was classified as a mental illness in the US – it had been a crime in the UK until only two years earlier. Integral to this uprising against anti-queer police harassment were trans women, including Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. The deletion of the word from a website dedicated to one of the most important areas of gay activism works immediately to delegitimise trans people and clear the way for conservative groups to frame them as sick, or the result of a brand new contagion. By that Thursday evening, “queer” and the letter Q had also been disappeared from the site, along with words deemed too “woke” on thousands of other government websites. Elsewhere, Google removed Black History Month, Women’s History Month and LGBTQ+ holidays from its online calendars. It was as if a van had quietly driven across America vandalising shrines with white paint. It’s clear that the past is being erased in order to direct the future. But – a key part of our history of oppression is resistance. In the US, where abortion is again banned in 20 states (and a government website outlining reproductive rights was removed within hours of President Donald Trump taking office), young women are getting sterilised. A recent study found that tubal sterilisation visits increased 70% after May 2022 (when the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v Wade leaked) in states likely to ban abortion. Perhaps it’s ironic that one effect of “pro-life” legislation will be fewer babies born. That news led me to dip back into the story of the Jane Collective, a group of activists who, in the 1960s when abortion was illegal in the US, put up posters: “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Call Jane.” First they referred women to doctors known to perform safe abortions, then they learned how to do it themselves. Women paid what they could afford and many said (in a lifetime of being dismissed or misunderstood) it was the best medical experience they’d had. Between 1969 and 1973, it’s estimated that the Jane Collective provided safe abortions for more than 11,000 people. Looking out across the anxious suburbs today, I can absolutely imagine school-gate mums organising similar. It’s no coincidence that the same tactics used to restrict abortion access are used to restrict gender-affirming care, nor that they’re lobbied for by the same conservative groups, who litigate loudly against trans, gay and abortion rights. It is bewildering, though, to see feminists who engage in anti-trans rhetoric offering up their own reproductive rights as a sweetener. Authoritarian movements require solidarity to resist, otherwise we’re all toast. And, with these rollbacks in the US, it feels urgent. At a rightwing conference two weeks ago, Kemi Badenoch said that “pronouns, diversity policies and climate activism” are a “poison”. Abortion is under attack here, too. In the decade leading to 2022, police in England and Wales recorded at least 67 cases of procuring an illegal abortion, with some women facing prosecution. Even if charges weren’t brought, the impact of the investigation can cause life-changing harm to the women and their families, with children being removed from their mothers or access restricted. In January, medical leaders spoke out after an “unprecedented” rise in women and girls being prosecuted for ending their own pregnancies – it’s still a criminal offence to have an abortion without approval from two doctors, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In 2025. In 2025! The more pregnancies I’ve had, the more noisy I get about the fact no person should be forced to continue a pregnancy against their will, or lose their autonomy and have their body policed. It feels as if it might be time to get our hands dirty, and form alliances to fight every deleted letter. Because when the words start disappearing, our rights are surely not far behind.

"abortion","Texas city to vote on ban on people helping patients traveling for abortion","A city nestled in the northern tip of Texas, which was at the heart of a major US supreme court case over abortion rights this year, has found itself at the forefront of the abortion wars once again. Come November, residents of Amarillo, Texas, will vote on an ordinance that would declare Amarillo a “sanctuary city for the unborn” and ban people from helping patients travel through Amarillo to access abortions – what the ordinance calls “abortion trafficking”. It would also ban people from possessing or distributing abortion pills within Amarillo city limits. Over the last several months, a string of Texas localities have passed similar ordinances. Amarillo’s city council spent months arguing over whether to pass its own “sanctuary city” ordinance, but in June, the council officially rejected it. However, while the ordinance languished before the council, a separate group gathered enough signatures for the ordinance to appear on Amarillo’s November ballot. Although the city council is still deliberating the language to describe the ordinance on the ballot, activists in the city are already gearing up to campaign against it. “We are ready,” said Lindsay London, an activist with the Amarillo Reproductive Freedom Alliance. “Travel bans harm communities. They harm the privacy of medical relationships. They do not help our communities to be strong and safe and supported.” Amarillo Reproductive Freedom Alliance, which is run by volunteers, plans to canvass, phone-bank and even take out billboards. “We’ve never done this before,” London said. “We have our work cut out for us.” If passed, the ordinance would not expose people seeking abortions to liability, but rather anyone who “aids or abets an elective abortion if the abortion is performed on a resident of Amarillo” regardless of where the abortion occurs. Texans may sue one another over suspected violations of the law, with damages of $10,000 for each violation. In 2021, Texas enacted a similar law to undermine Roe v Wade’s protections and ban abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Texas law already bans almost all abortions. But because Amarillo is one of the few major cities in the Texas panhandle, travelers from Texas and other southern states may pass through it on their way to New Mexico, where abortion remains accessible. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe two years ago, Amarillo has become something of a ground zero for fights over abortion. In late 2022, a coalition of anti-abortion doctors and activists filed a lawsuit over abortion pills in a federal court located in Amarillo. The lawsuit argued that the Food and Drug Administration had overstepped its authority when it approved mifepristone, a common abortion pill, for use in abortions in 2000. By filing the case in Amarillo, the abortion opponents effectively guaranteed that it would land on the desk of Matthew Kacsmaryk, a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump with a history of opposition to LGBTQ+ rights. Last year, Kacsmaryk ruled in favor of suspending the FDA approval of mifepristone – a move that could have devastated abortion access across the country, including in states that protect abortion rights. The case ultimately became the first abortion case to land at the supreme court since the overturning of Roe. Last month, the supreme court ruled in a 9-0 decision that the abortion opponents behind the case did not have the legal right to sue in the first place. “Kacsmaryk’s placement in a federal court here has made Amarillo an unsuspecting hotbed for repro rights and repro decisions that can have huge ramifications,” London said. “But when it comes to the day-to-day voter, many of them have no idea that this is even something that’s happening.” Amarillo’s proposed “sanctuary city” ordinance repeatedly cites the federal Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice act that bans the mailing of all abortion-related materials. Although the Biden administration has issued guidance declaring that the Comstock Act – whose anti-abortion provisions were blocked from taking effect under Roe – only applies to people who intend to break the law, some anti-abortion activists believe that the Comstock Act can be used to implement a nationwide abortion ban. “We call upon every United States attorney in the state of Texas, both present and future, to investigate and prosecute abortion providers and abortion pill-distribution networks,” the proposed ordinance declares, urging lawyers to go after providers using the Comstock Act as well as anti-racketeering laws. By seeding references to the Comstock Act in legislation and litigation throughout the country, anti-abortion activists are hoping to create opportunities for higher courts to step in and rule that the 151-year-old Comstock Act remains good law. Project 2025, a playbook written by the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggests that a future Republican president use the Comstock Act to ban the mailing of all abortion pills. Some anti-abortion activists in Texas – such as Mark Lee Dickson, who has pushed for Amarillo’s “sanctuary city” ordinance – have gone even further, arguing that the Comstock Act also bans the mailing of both pills and “any surgical equipment used for an elective abortion”. Such an interpretation of the Comstock Act would effectively ban almost all abortions.","2024-07-19T13:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/19/texas-abortion-travel-ban"
"abortion","Sally Field recalls her ‘hideous’ illegal abortion at 17 as she urges voters to back Kamala Harris","Sally Field has spoken about the “hideous” and “traumatic” illegal abortion she underwent as a 17-year-old in 1964, as she called on voters to get behind Kamala Harris in the upcoming US presidential election. The Oscar-winning actor first revealed her abortion in her 2018 memoir In Pieces, but wrote in the caption of her video, shared on Instagram, that she had “been so hesitant to do this, to tell my horrific story”. “It was during a time even worse than now,” she wrote. “A time when contraception was not readily available and only if you were married. But I feel that so many women of my generation went through similar, traumatic events and I feel stronger when I think of them. I believe, like me, they must want to fight for their grandchildren and all the young women of this country.” In the video, Field said she still feels “very shamed” about the abortion “because I was raised in the 50s, and it’s ingrained in me.” She was 17 when she underwent the procedure in 1964 – nine years before Roe v Wade introduced a constitutional right to abortion, which was upheld until the US supreme court overturned federal-level abortion rights in June 2022. The actor said she had “no choices in my life” and little family support when she discovered she was pregnant. A family friend who was a doctor drove her, her mother and his wife to Tijuana, Mexico so she could undergo the abortion. “We parked on a really scroungy-looking street, it was scary and he parked about three blocks away and said, ‘See that building down there?’ And he gave me an envelope with cash and I was to walk into that building and give them the cash and then come right back to him,” Field said, saying she believed he’d travelled with her in case she died. The procedure was “beyond hideous and life-altering” and she “had no anaesthetic”, she said. “There was a technician giving me a few puffs of ether but he would then take it away, so it just made my arms and legs feel numb [and] weird, but I felt everything – how much pain I was in,” she said. “Then the situation turned darker. I realized that the technician was actually molesting me, so I had to figure out, how can I make my arms move to push him away? So it was just this absolute pit of shame. And then, when it was finished, they said, ‘Go go go go go!’, like the building was on fire. And they didn’t want me there, you know, it was illegal.” She thanked her doctor for his “generosity and bravery” in risking his licence by taking her to Mexico, and recalled that before the trip, she had never left her home state or been on an plane. But a few months after the illegal abortion, she began auditioning and booked her breakout role in Gidget soon after. “These are the things that women are going through now – when they’re trying to get to another state, they don’t have the money, they don’t have the means, they don’t know where they’re going,” Field said. “And it’s beyond, and do that to our little girls and our young women, and not have respect and regard for their health and their own decisions about whether they feel they’re able to give birth to a child at that time.” In her caption, the actor called on voters to support Harris and Tim Walz or “those with ballot initiatives that could protect reproductive freedom.” ““PLEASE. WE CAN’T GO BACK!!” she ended. Field previously endorsed Harris for president when Joe Biden stepped down, telling Variety in July that she was “so grateful” to Biden and that she supported Harris “with my whole 77-year-old heart.” Public polling has long held that most Americans favour access to abortion, but many Republican-led state legislatures have sought to restrict access, mainly citing conservative religious beliefs. While Roe v Wade was overturned two years after Donald Trump’s presidency ended, three US supreme court justice appointed by him formed part of the conservative bloc that struck the landmark decision down, with fears a second Trump presidency would restrict women’s reproductive rights even more. Trump’s wife, Melania, recently revealed she is a passionate supporter of women’s right to abortion, writing in her new memoir: “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.”","2024-10-08T03:56:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/08/sally-field-recalls-her-hideous-abortion-at-17-as-she-urges-voters-to-back-kamala-harris"
"abortion","Supreme court says Idaho abortion ruling ‘inadvertently’ published online – as it happened","The supreme court turned down an attempt by Republican-led states to block the Biden administration’s coordination with social media companies on fighting disinformation, one of only two decisions the conservative-dominated panel released today. They still have yet to rule on cases concerning Donald Trump’s prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election and the scope of federal government regulations, but will issue more opinions on Thursday and Friday. But perhaps an even bigger story than what the court actually decided is what it inadvertently decided. Bloomberg Law noticed that the court had accidentally posted its opinion in a closely watched case pitting Idaho against the Biden administration, and a 6-3 majority was going to require the Republican-led state to allow emergency abortions – at least for now. Here’s what else happened today: House Republicans convened a little-known congressional body to intervene on behalf of top Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s attempts to stay out of jail. The supreme court once again overturned the ultra-conservative fifth circuit court of appeals, in its ruling over social media disinformation. Here’s why that’s significant. Trump claims he can get detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich out of jail in Russia, if he wins the November election. The Wall Street Journal reporter’s trial began behind closed doors today. Encounters at the southern border dropped by 40% after Joe Biden imposed restrictions that will temporarily restrict access to asylum seekers, the homeland security department said. Progressives are not pleased after congressman Jamaal Bowman lost his Democratic primary yesterday, and are training their ire on the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac). A group of Black campaign surrogates for Donald Trump met at a barbershop in Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood Wednesday, ahead of the head-to-head between Trump and Joe Biden here tomorrow. Trump made a phone appearance to tout his accomplishments for the Black community while in office and his proposal to end taxation on tips. “Let the people earn what they earn,” Trump said, adding that he was aware he was talking to people in a barbershop who do tipped service work. “And it has been so popular beyond anything.” Both Trump and Biden are blitzing metro Atlanta with events leading up to the debate. Rocky’s Barber Shop, a Black-owned business in Atlanta’s more affluent neighborhood, hosted conservative Black leaders from metro Atlanta. Shelley Winter, a conservative talk show host here, asked Trump if he thought that CNN debate moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would treat him fairly. “Well, I think it would be good for them if they did,” Trump replied. “I think probably not,” he added, expressing lingering ire about Tapper cutting off his televised victory speech after winning the primaries. So they cover the whole primary, but they don’t cover my victory speech. So am I going to get it fair? Probably not, but it would be very good for CNN. They’re having a lot of ratings problems. Two potential choices for vice president who did not need a haircut found themselves at the shop anyway Wednesday: congressman Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and former housing and urban development secretary Dr. Ben Carson. “I just want to encourage you to continue to speak out because the attacks on you have been absolutely ridiculous,” Carson said. “We’re praying that God will give you the strength to bear it because you’re standing in there for all of us.” Donalds said we would see if he was Trump’s vice presidential pick. Does he want to be vice president? “Of course!” he replied. Trump said on Saturday that he had already made up his mind about who he would choose to be vice president, and that his choice would be present in Atlanta for the debate. The number of encounters at the south-west border was down 40% in the three weeks since Joe Biden announced new rules restricting asylum, the Department of Homeland Security announced on Wednesday. According to a DHS fact sheet, the average daily arrests over a seven-day period has fallen to under 2,400 encounters per day, the lowest level of encounters since January 2021. It is still not low enough to lift the order. Asylum processing resumes when encounters fall to an average of 1,500 encounters across a seven-day period. “It’s a remarkable feat that our personnel have accomplished in just such a short period of time,” DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Wednesday. “Congress failed to act. The president has acted.” But he said congressional action was needed to send more resources to border patrol and that without legislation the order could be lifted or reversed by the courts or a future administration. Last week, CBP said encounters fell by 25%, meaning illegal border crossings dropped significantly since then. Encounters were already on a downward trend before Biden’s asylum order, due in part to a crackdown on northward migration by Mexican officials. Seasonal patterns also affect crossings. Opponents have sued the administration to block the order. Cori Bush, the Democratic congresswoman of Missouri and another prominent member of the progressive “Squad”, has issued a statement calling Jamaal Bowman her “brother-in-service” and attacking Aipac’s role in his primary defeat last night. Bowman is the “true representation of transformational leadership and brings … the power of everyday people from our communities to Congress each and every day,” Bush wrote. AIPAC and their allies—backed by far-right Donald Trump megadonors—poured a tidal wave of cash into this primary race showing us just how desperate these billionaire extremists are in their attempts to buy our democracy, promote their own gain, and silence the voices of progress and justice. There should be no question about the need to get Big Money out of politics. A recent poll shows Bush at risk of losing in her own primary contest for Missouri’s 1st congressional district, one point behind challenger Wesley Bell. The pollster, The Mellman Group, said: Bush is still seen favorably, but assessments of her and her performance are moving in a negative direction, while Bell’s image is improving, leaving him with an underlying image advantage. With some six weeks to go and 11% [of voters surveyed] still undecided, this race can go either way, but Bell has achieved a slight advantage. Jamaal Bowman’s primary defeat on Tuesday was a “loss for young people and anyone who cares about our continued movement toward justice, peace, and building a multiracial democracy,” Protect Our Power said in a statement. The progressive group blamed “Aipac and the Maga billionaires who recruited and paid for George Latimer’s campaign from start to finish” for the defeat, and vowed “to tell Aipac they have no business creating division in our democracy”. In a separate letter of protest, Jewish Voice for Peace Action (JVP) said it was “saddened” by the results that had unseated a congressman who “has been one of the few members of Congress committed to defending Palestinian human rights”. “Today is a sad day for American democracy,” said JVP’s political director, Beth Miller. She added: To protect progressive candidates moving forward it is essential that Democrats reject Aipac. Progressive groups are calling on House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to reject the endorsement and donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) in the wake of congressman Jamaal Bowman‘s primary loss in New York. The United Democracy Project, a super Pac affiliated with Aipac, dumped nearly $15m into Bowman’s district as part of its successful effort to elevate George Latimer to the Democratic nomination. A coalition of progressive groups, outraged over Aipac’s involvement in the race, sent a letter to Jeffries today demanding that he reconsider his association with the group and denounce its tactics. “AIPAC turned the NY16 race into the most expensive Democratic primary in history, waging an unacceptable assault on our democracy, our communities, and our shared future. We call on you to take action to address this threat,” the letter reads. AIPAC’s interference in Democratic politics poses a grave danger to the vision our organizations fight for every day: a future in which everyone can access a high quality education, comprehensive healthcare, a liveable climate, affordable housing, good jobs for good pay, humane immigration policies, human rights centered foreign policy — and more. Latimer defeated Bowman by 17 points yesterday, and he is now heavily favored to win the seat in November, as the Cook Political Report rates the district as solid Democrat. The abortion rights group Reproductive Freedom for All has said it agrees with Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson’s reported reservations in the copy of the opinion briefly posted on the supreme court’s website. “This is not a victory but a delay,” the group said in a statement responding to the court’s reported decision to permit abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho. The abortion bans that are putting people’s lives on the line in the first place will continue to remain on the books. We’re grateful that the Biden administration is fighting to preserve the shreds of access possible in states where anti-abortion extremists are doing everything in their power to block people from the care they need, even under the most dire of circumstances. The group said it will not forget that Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans are responsible for those bans, adding: Our rights are on the line, and we must send President Biden back to the White House to restore the federal right to abortion and end these bans once and for all. The copy of the opinion suggesting that the supreme court may rule to permit abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho may not be final and could be changed. According to the copy obtained by Bloomberg, a majority of justices will reportedly dismiss the case as “improvidently granted”, meaning the supreme court should not have accepted the case. The ruling would reinstate a lower court’s order that had allowed Idaho hospitals to perform abortions in cases where a woman’s health may be endangered, according to the outlet. Currently, the state’s law only allows abortions when a woman’s “life” is in danger. Idaho has sought to have abortion exempted from the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala), a precedent critics said would endanger pregnant people in any state that has abortion restrictions. Although many states allow doctors to perform an emergency abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, effectively mirroring Emtala, Idaho only allowed doctors to intervene when a woman was on the brink of death, a much higher bar for intervention. The Biden administration sued Idaho to enforce the law. The Emtala law, signed by abortion opponent Ronald Reagan, sought to protect pregnant women in active labor in particular. Until its passage, hospitals often transferred or “dumped” women who could not pay when they suffered an emergency on public hospitals, even when in advanced stages of labor. Emtala had endured a series of attacks, including by some hospital administrators who viewed it as an “unfunded mandate”. Although the federal government required hospitals to treat sick patients, it never provided money to care for indigent patients. Bernie Sanders has joined those blaming the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) for congressman Jamaal Bowman’s primary loss in New York last night. Bowman, whose criticism of Israel’s war on Gaza made him a target for pro-Israel lobbying groups, was defeated by George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist, after Aipac and an affiliated group spent almost $15m to defeat him. Sanders, in a statement today, said it was an “outrage and an insult to democracy that we maintain a corrupt campaign finance system which allows billionaire-funded super PACs to buy elections.” He added: AIPAC and other super PACs spent over $23 million to defeat Bowman. He spent $3 million. That is a spending gap which is virtually impossible to overcome. It is not a coincidence that with our corrupt campaign finance system we also have a rigged economy that allows the very rich to get much richer while many working people are falling further behind. Big Money buys politicians who will do their bidding, and the results are clear. The Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus has responded to the news that the supreme court may be poised to allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho. “We are all watching,” the caucus posted to X, adding: With lives hanging in the balance, we hope this indicates a step forward for patients’ access to emergency abortion care. Now, it is up to #SCOTUS to confirm that this is true and they will indeed protect that right and uphold federal law. Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest abortion provider, writes that any decision that falls short of guaranteeing patients’ access to abortion care in emergencies would be “catastrophic”. The supreme court has acknowledged to Bloomberg Law that the ruling in a case over whether hospitals in Idaho can be required to carry out abortions in emergencies was published by accident. The court’s public information officer Patricia McCabe told the outlet: “The Court’s Publications Unit inadvertently and briefly uploaded a document to the Court’s website. The Court’s opinion in Moyle v. United States and Idaho v. United States will be issued in due course.” Bloomberg Law goes on to report that the ruling is 6-3 in favor of the Biden administration, with conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito dissenting. However, the ruling is structured to allow litigation over the issue to continue, and not resolve the broader question of whether the federal government can require emergency abortions be performed in states where the procedure is banned: The high court decision “will prevent Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban when the termination of a pregnancy is needed to prevent serious harms to a woman’s health,” Justice Elena Kagan said in a concurring opinion. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn’t have dismissed the case, according to the copy that was briefly online. “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,” she wrote. “While this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires.” The posted decision indicates the court won’t resolve broader questions about the intersection of state abortion bans and a federal law designed to ensure hospitals treat patients who arrive in need of emergency care. The case is the supreme court’s first look at a state abortion ban since the conservative majority overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. The court on 13 June preserved full access to the widely used abortion pill mifepristone, saying anti-abortion doctors and organizations lacked legal standing to press a lawsuit. A supreme court opinion in a high-profile abortion case that is revealed to the public before it is supposed to be? If this sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Just over a month and a half before the supreme court’s ruling in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which five conservative justices overturned the 49-year-old constitutional protections on abortion created by Roe v Wade, someone leaked the majority’s draft opinion. To this day, it has not been revealed who was behind the disclosure, though there are plenty of theories as to why someone would want to leak it. In that case, the leaked draft generally lined up with how the court ended up ruling, and gave the public early warning that Roe was poised to fall. And indeed it did, setting the stage for states to ban abortion, and an array of legal battles to play out over circumstances in which the procedure should remain available – which is what the Idaho case is about. Here’s more on the unsuccessful investigation into the Dobbs leak: According to the eagle-eyed sleuths at Bloomberg Law, who somehow spotted the apparently erroneously published opinion in the Idaho abortion case, or had someone give it to them, the supreme court will dismiss the state’s case as “improvidently granted”. That would reinstate a lower court decision allowing hospitals to perform abortions when the health of the mother is at risk. The court did not respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg Law, which notes that the copy of the ruling is not necessarily the final decision. The supreme court today published an opinion, apparently by accident, that shows the justices will rule in favor of the Biden administration in a dispute with Idaho over whether hospitals there can be required to carry out abortions in emergencies, Bloomberg Law reports. The opinion, which was later taken down, indicates the court will dismiss Idaho’s challenge to the regulations and require federally funded hospitals to perform the procedure in emergencies, despite the state’s strict ban on abortions. The supreme court turned down an attempt by Republican-led states to block the Biden administration’s coordination with social media companies to fight disinformation, one of only two decisions the conservative-dominated panel released today. They still have yet to rule on cases concerning Donald Trump’s prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election, the scope of federal government regulations, or emergency abortions, but answers could come soon: the court is set to issue more decisions on Thursday and Friday. Here’s what else has happened today so far: House Republicans convened a little-known congressional body to intervene on behalf of top Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s attempts to stay out of jail. The supreme court once again overturned the ultra-conservative fifth circuit court of appeals in its ruling over social media disinformation. Here’s why that’s significant. Trump claims he can get detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich out of jail in Russia, if he wins the November election. The Wall Street Journal reporter’s trial begins behind closed doors today. Donald Trump is gearing up for his debate with Joe Biden tomorrow in Atlanta, as are his allies. In remarks to reporters today, Republican House speaker Mike Johnson made the argument, often repeated among conservatives, that Biden’s energy levels are no match for Trump’s: We’ll see who’s right when the parlay kicks off tomorrow at 9pm ET. The behind-closed-doors trial of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich begins today in Ekaterinburg, Russia, and the US government has decried it as politically motivated. To Donald Trump, it’s yet another thing he can use to convince voters to elect him over Joe Biden in November. On Truth Social, the former president has alleged that he can somehow get Russia to release Gershkovich if he wins the election: Here’s more on the start of the trial: Shortly before a judge confirmed that he must indeed report to prison by Monday, Steve Bannon spoke for a very long time to the Guardian’s David Smith. Here’s what he said: It is not your typical man cave. Christian iconography. A bust of Julius Caesar. A painting of John Paul Jones, the revolutionary war naval officer. A book, The Russian Revolution by Richard Pipes, sitting on a crowded desk. A sign resting on the mantelpiece declares: “There are no conspiracies, but there are no coincidences.” Welcome to the War Room, where the classical, contemporary and conspiratorial nourish Steve Bannon’s grand vision of himself as a historical figure. Each day he holds court in this basement on Capitol Hill to plot not only Donald Trump’s return to power but the next American revolution. Screens, microphones and other podcasting paraphernalia sit above piles of books and newspapers, namely the Financial Times and New York Times. “I was a paper boy so I love papers,” explains Bannon, picking up his phone as he continues: “You can’t read it on here. It’s not the same. First off, one of the most important things is the editorial choices. Very important how they place it, how they do it.” The 70-year-old – once featured on the front of Time magazine with the headlines “The Great Manipulator” and “Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?” – is constantly thinking about the media and shaping narratives. He believes that he wields more influence through his War Room show, which launched in October 2019, than he did working on Trump’s first election campaign or during a brief, ill-fated spell as White House chief strategist. His impact on the 2024 election is about to be severely disrupted: Bannon must report to prison by 1 July to serve a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the congressional committee that investigated the 6 January 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol. That means he should be back on air just before the 5 November presidential election. Ever heard of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (Blag)? Many people who watch Congress have not, but the panel has received an injection of prominence today from the Republican leaders of the House, who are attempting to use its powers to help influential Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon appeal his contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon is supposed to report to prison by 1 July, after being convicted of charges related to defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection in 2022. He is nonetheless continuing to appeal his conviction, and that’s where the Blag comes in. The five-member panel “is responsible for articulating the House’s institutional position in legal filings with federal, state, and local courts”, and is composed of the top Republicans and Democrats in the chamber. Today, House speaker Mike Johnson, majority leader Steve Scalise and whip Tom Emmer voted to intervene in the case, over the objections of Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and whip Katherine Clark. Here’s what the GOP had to say about that: The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group voted 3-2 to file a brief with the D.C. Circuit in the case against Steve Bannon. The amicus brief will be submitted after Bannon files a petition for rehearing en banc and will be in support of neither party. It will withdraw certain arguments made by the House earlier in the litigation about the organization of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol during the prior Congress. House Republican Leadership continues to believe Speaker Pelosi abused her authority when organizing the Select Committee. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the judiciary committee, saw the supreme court’s decision in Murthy v Missouri as a direct rebuke of Jim Jordan’s campaign to characterize social media firms as complicit in censorship. “As expected, the Supreme Court has issued a stinging rebuke to Jim Jordan and his multimillion-dollar conspiracy theory fueled witch hunt,” Nadler said in a statement. He continued: The Court concluded that the social media platforms ‘exercised their own judgement’ with regards to content moderation—which is precisely what we have heard from the dozens of witnesses that Jim Jordan has dragged before this committee. The Court also pointed out that the basis for House Republicans’ partisan reign of harassment against social media companies was inaccurate and outright false. I hope that after this humiliating defeat Chairman Jordan and his colleagues will end their failed investigation into the companies, universities, and individuals who have been trying to stop the spread of harmful misinformation and disinformation on social media. Jim Jordan, the rightwing Republican chair of the House judiciary committee, has been a prominent voice alleging that the Biden administration is censoring conservatives on social media. The supreme court did not exactly weigh in on that claim, but did find that the Republican-led states who challenged the White House’s contacts with social media companies in Murthy v Missouri did not have standing to sue. Here’s what Jordan, who also chairs the subcommittee on the “weaponization of government”, had to say about that: The First Amendment is first for a reason, and the freedom of expression should be protected from any infringement by the government. Our country benefits when ideas can be tested and debated fairly on their merits, whether online or in the halls of Congress. The Committee and the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government have uncovered how and the extent to which the Biden Administration engaged in a censorship campaign in violation of the First Amendment. While we respectfully disagree with the Court’s decision, our investigation has shown the need for legislative reforms, such as the Censorship Accountability Act, to better protect Americans harmed by the unconstitutional censorship-industrial complex. Our important work will continue. With the Murthy v Missouri ruling, we are seeing the emergence of an interesting and potentially critical pattern involving relations between the ultra-right fifth circuit court of appeals and the US supreme court. In both today’s decision and the momentous opinion earlier this month to allow continued access to the abortion pill mifepristone, the supreme court slapped down the fifth circuit on grounds of standing. They found that the appeals court had been mistaken in allowing the cases to proceed, because the challengers in each case were not directly injured by the actions to which they objected. The fifth circuit is the most hard rightwing court in the country – of its 17 active judges, six were appointed by Donald Trump. As a result, it has become a channel for Maga legal actions, with rightwing activists creating extreme cases designed expressly for the court. Take the mifepristone case. Anti-abortion activists picked a particular judge in Texas with a known hard-right track record, knowing that he would side with them and that the case would then go through the fifth circuit up to the supreme court. That a majority of the court has seen through this tactic and rebuffed it in both the mifepristone and today’s Murthy ruling is a sign that the wildest extremities of far-right legal thinking are not yet upon us. But watch this space. The supreme court has just wrapped up releasing decisions for the day, but they’re far from finished. There are just under a dozen matters the nine justices have yet to weigh in on, but we will hear from them soon: the court has scheduled tomorrow and Friday as days to release more opinions. The last opinion of the day is Snyder v US, which deals with federal bribery law, and is not among the politically charged matters the court is considering. The court’s six conservatives have found in favor of the former mayor of an Indiana city, who challenged his conviction for bribery by arguing the money he was prosecuted for receiving does not violate federal law. The three liberals dissented. Here is the lineup of justices that concurred and dissented in Murthy v Missouri: Much as with the conservative attempt to roll back the availability of abortion medication mifepristone, the decision in Murthy v Missouri over the Biden administration’s contacts with social media firms hinged on whether the justices believed the plaintiffs had standing to sue. Writing for the majority, conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett found that they did not: The plaintiffs, two States and five social-media users, sued dozens of Executive Branch officials and agencies, alleging that they pressured the platforms to suppress protected speech in violation of the First Amendment. The Fifth Circuit agreed, concluding that the officials’ communications rendered them responsible for the private platforms’ moderation decisions. It then affirmed a sweeping preliminary injunction. The Fifth Circuit was wrong to do so. To establish standing, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a substantial risk that, in the near future, they will suffer an injury that is traceable to a Government defendant and redressable by the injunction they seek. Because no plaintiff has carried that burden, none has standing to seek a preliminary injunction. In their first decision of the day, the supreme court’s liberals and some conservatives banded together to reject a challenge, brought by Republican-led states, to efforts by the Biden administration to work with social media companies in combatting misinformation over the coronavirus. Here’s more on the case: It’s almost 10am in Washington DC, when the supreme court will begin issuing decisions. We don’t know which cases they will rule on in advance, but will let you know what they are as they come out. In about half an hour, the supreme court may release one or multiple decisions with major impact on US politics and policies. But the conservative-dominated panel has already handed down several important rulings this term so far. Here are a few of them: In March, it rejected a challenge to Donald Trump’s presence on Colorado’s ballot, putting an end to efforts by advocacy groups to bar him from running for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The decision was unanimous, and in their opinions, the justices avoided weighing on whether they believed he was guilty of insurrection: Earlier this month, the court rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone, a common abortion pill, again unanimously. That all the justices signed on to the decision wasn’t an indication of broad agreement over abortion, but rather the view that the groups who brought the case did not have standing to sue: Last week, the court’s three liberals and five of its six conservatives joined together to uphold a federal law that prohibited gun possession by people under a domestic violence restraining order, in a case gun control advocates feared could be used to further erode controls on firearms: But the three liberals were in the minority earlier in the month, when the conservatives overturned a Trump-era ban on “bump stocks”, a device that can make weapons fire rapidly, and was used in the deadliest mass shooting in US history: Good morning, US politics blog readers. We are bracing for a morning that begins with a relative bang, when the supreme court releases another batch of opinions at 10am ET. The court, where conservatives have a six-justice supermajority and liberals a three-justice minority, has been steadily working through its backlog of undecided cases over the past weeks – meaning that most of the outstanding matters carry significant political weight. Among these are Donald Trump’s petition for immunity from the federal charges brought against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, the squabble between the Biden administration and Idaho over whether states can be required to carry out emergency abortions, and cases that could upend federal regulations, and social media moderation. It is unlikely that decisions on all of these cases will come out today, since the court has also scheduled Thursday and Friday to release more opinions. We won’t know in advance how many cases have been decided, or on which subjects, but chances seem good for at least one major decision to be published. We will be blogging live as they are released. Here’s what else is going on today: Washington DC will be digesting the fallout from yesterday’s primaries in Colorado, Utah and New York, as well as runoffs in South Carolina. Progressive Jamaal Bowman is on his way out of the House of Representatives after losing his primary, rightwing star Lauren Boebert has succeeded in winning the GOP primary in a deeply conservative Colorado district, and several Trump-backed candidates were turned away by voters in different states. House Republicans are attempting an unusual procedural tactic to prevent top Trump ally Steve Bannon from having to report to prison by Monday to serve his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.

"abortion","Texas abortion ban linked to increase in infant deaths, new study finds","A six-week abortion ban in Texas was linked to a 13% increase in the number of infants who died in their first year of life, a new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics suggests. The study, published two years to the day since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and permitted more than a dozen states across the country to outlaw almost all abortions, is one of the first glimpses into how strict abortion bans impact babies’ health. The study also estimated that the ban may have led the number of infants in Texas who died within their first month of life to rise more than 10%. Because Texas enacted its six-week abortion ban in September 2021, months before Roe’s demise, scholars have studied what has happened in Texas for clues about how post-Roe abortion bans are now affecting the rest of the nation. Some of the researchers involved in the Monday study have previously concluded that the Texas ban also led to 10,000 additional births. “Texas is the harbinger of potentially what’s to come with Dobbs,” said Alison Gemmill, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said, referring to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the case that overturned Roe. “One of the things we’re doing now, as you can imagine, is looking at Dobbs and infant mortality as a next step.” The study found a 23% jump in infant deaths due to congenital anomalies – the kind of conditions that are often identified in utero and lead to abortions in states where the procedure is legal, since they can be incompatible with life. But that choice is no longer available to pregnant Texans. “Prior to this policy, if an anomaly was detected, people would have had the ability to legally terminate at least up to maybe about 20 weeks, or even maybe 22 weeks gestation,” said Alison Gemmill, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Any infant death is tragic, but then layering on top of that, this pregnant person’s situation where they know that they’re carrying a fetus that is incompatible with life, whereas before, they maybe would have had the option to terminate.” In order to isolate the impact of the Texas ban and establish a causal link between the law and infant mortality, Gemmill and the other researchers analyzed death certificates in Texas and 28 other states from January 2018 to February 2022. They built a “synthetic” statistical model of Texas that calculated the number of infant deaths that may have occurred if Texas had never enacted its six-week ban, then compared that model to the number of deaths that actually occurred in the state. Two hundred and sixteen more infant deaths occurred due to the Texas six-week abortion ban, the researchers estimated. Gemmill plans to investigate how Roe’s demise may have led to increases in births among children who did not die but may need continued and substantial medical help to survive. After Roe collapsed, enabling Texas to outlaw almost all abortions, Texas has also become the epicenter of the debate over doctors’ ability to provide medically necessary abortions. Like every other state with an abortion ban, Texas technically permits abortions in emergencies – but doctors in Texas and across the country have said that abortion bans are worded in such a way that they become unusable. Instead of acting, doctors say they have been forced to wait until patients get sick enough that they can intervene. Last year, dozens of women who said they had been denied medically necessary abortions sued Texas in the hopes of clarifying its abortion ban. At least one of the women, denied an abortion and unable to leave the state, ended up giving birth to an infant who died within hours of her birth. In May, the Texas supreme court – which is composed entirely of Republicans – rejected their challenge. After months of delay and calls for action from both abortion rights supporters and abortion opponents, the Texas Medical Board on Friday issued guidance to clarify that “lack of imminent risk of death or substantial impairment to a patient should not preclude a physician from doing what is medically necessary”, as the board president said in a statement. However, the guidance does not preclude Texas prosecutors from pursuing charges against doctors. The researchers behind the Monday study did not have access to records that broke down infant deaths by demographic information such as race or ethnicity, so it is not clear if specific groups were more likely to give birth to babies who later died. However, researchers noted, the infant death rate among non-Hispanic Black women is triple that among non-Hispanic white women. Low-income women are also more likely to have lacked the resources needed to flee Texas for abortions in other states. “This research shows that when attempting to legislate something as complex as pregnancy,” Gemmill said, “it is crucial to design policies based on a thorough understanding of public health impacts and robust scientific evidence.”","2024-06-24T15:04:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/24/texas-abortion-ban-infant-deaths"
"abortion","Former union head Joe de Bruyn’s speech condemning abortion and same-sex marriage sparks walkout at Catholic university","A former union head has doubled down on comments he made at an Australian Catholic University (ACU) graduation ceremony which compared abortion to the “human toll of World War II” and alleged same-sex marriage went against “every society on Earth”. The speech, delivered by a former national president of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association (SDA), Joe de Bruyn, prompted a mass walkout at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday. De Bruyn, who was being bestowed an honorary doctorate, told education and arts, law and commerce graduates that abortion was the “single biggest killer” of human life that “must be ended”. “I have for several decades been involved in opposing abortion, the deliberate killing of unborn human beings,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “Today, over 80,000 unborn children are killed by abortion in Australia each year worldwide – the estimated number is 42 million each year. “Abortion is the single biggest killer of human beings in the world, greater than the human toll of World War II. It is a tragedy that must be ended.” Footage of the event showed many attendees walking out during De Bruyn’s speech, which was attended by staff, students and family members. De Bruyn told Guardian Australia he was approached by the ACU in November offering him the honorary doctorate and inviting him to give the graduation address, which he accepted, providing his speech a week in advance. “They knew what I was going to say, as to their attitude you’d have to ask them,” he said. “I don’t want to offend anybody but you can’t say ‘I’m sensitive’ and therefore you are not allowed to talk about some issue – it shuts down public debate.” He said the topics he spanned were “perfectly logical” given he was being honoured by a Catholic university on his services to the Catholic church, describing abortion as a “catastrophic issue” that needed to be discussed. His speech also touched on LGBTQ+ rights. Last year, the ACU faced controversy for ordering librarians to remove the public display of rainbow flags across campuses. De Bruyn told graduates marriage between man and a woman was “instituted by God at the origin of humanity in the Garden of Eden” and “every society on Earth at all times” had recognised marriage as being between opposite sexes. The head of the ACU’s National Tertiary Education Union branch, Yaegan Doran, said the speech brought “shame on the union movement” and the university. “Abortion rights are fundamental to women’s rights,” he said. “Queer rights are not up for negotiation. Management’s choice to give him an honorary doctorate brings shame on the university.” One attendee, Laura, who did not want to use her surname, was at the graduation ceremony to celebrate her sister and walked out alongside other guests. She described the speech as “hateful” and “vitriolic”. “What should have been a day of pride for my sister, who is now a qualified primary school teacher, has been soured by this choice made by the ACU senate,” she said. “It’s absolutely shameful and disgusting.” De Bruyn was a former member of the Labor party national executive during his time as a union leader. The SDA was a major obstacle to the ALP legalising same-sex marriage before 2017. He was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen’s birthday honours list in 2022. A former crisis and risk communication lecturer at ACU, Tracie Winch, wrote on X that graduates who attended the event should be issued a refund and an apology. “Withdraw the honorary doctorate. Is this what you stand for?” she wrote. “University senate should be sacked.” In a statement, an ACU spokesman said it offered the honorary degree to De Bruyn “in recognition of his dedication to the rights of workers, educational advancement and improving social welfare”. “Mr De Bruyn’s remarks at the ceremony were delivered in a personal capacity. While his views may not be shared by many of our staff and students, as a university we encourage the respectful exchange of ideas that represent the wide spectrum of our diverse community.”","2024-10-22T00:48:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/22/joe-de-bruyn-speech-acu-walkouts-abortion-same-sex-marriage-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Harris was strongest at debate when talking about abortion while Trump relied on tired old lies","Throughout his 2024 campaign for president, Donald Trump has avoided giving straight, consistent or accurate answers to questions about abortion – and in his first debate appearance against Kamala Harris, Trump kept up that streak. Moderators introduced abortion, one of the biggest issues in the election, by asking about the most recent example of Trump’s incoherence on the topic: his position on a Florida ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state’s constitution. Over the last few weeks, Trump initially suggested that he would vote in favor of the measure – which would restore abortion rights in a state that has banned the procedure past six weeks of pregnancy – before quickly backtracking amid outrage from his anti-abortion base. Asked to explain his flip-flop, Trump said: “The reason I’m doing that vote – because the plan is – you know the vote is – they have abortion in the ninth month.” Less than a fraction of a percentage point of abortions take place after the 21st week of pregnancy. Executing a baby after birth, which Trump repeatedly accused Democrats of supporting, would be infanticide and it is illegal in all 50 states – as noted by the ABC News moderator Linsey Davis in a fact-check after he spoke. When pressed on abortion, Trump has long pivoted to making outlandish claims about killing babies. In his final debate against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, he claimed that “you can rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day”. That kind of gruesome rhetoric proved useful for Trump at the time, as leaders of the anti-abortion movement cheered him on and ultimately helped put him in the White House. In a post-Roe nation where most people support abortion rights, however, that rhetoric hits differently. “The accusations of extremism are a lot less effective when your own party is aligned with the movement that most Americans are perceiving as extreme,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the legal history of reproduction. Trump also claimed that “every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, every liberal, conservative – they all wanted this issue to be brought back to these states”. In reality, more than 60% of Americans disapproved of the decision to overturn Roe. Support for abortion rights has surged since Roe’s demise, including in red states. For Harris, meanwhile, the topic of abortion yielded some of her strongest moments in a debate already full of strong moments. She spoke passionately about women bleeding out from miscarriages unable to get care, victims of rape forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster, saw Harris’s comments on abortion as the moment the debate snapped into place for the vice-president. “The opening was a little more mixed,” Lake said. “I think Trump made a strong case on the economy but she just knocked it out of the park on the abortion stuff.” During her turn to speak, Harris appeared to reference the case of Jaci Statton, a woman who was told by Oklahoma hospital staffers that they could not end her nonviable pregnancy and to instead wait in a hospital parking lot until she was “crashing”. “She’s bleeding out in the car in the parking lot,” Harris said. “She didn’t want that. Her husband didn’t want that. A 12- or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don’t want that.” Tresa Undem, who’s been polling people on abortion for decades, thought the way Harris talked about abortion was “unprecedented”. “For undecided women and undecided independent men, I think it was pretty powerful and it can have an effect,” Undem said. “She reminded folks, including undecided voters, that most Americans are with her. Most Americans believe that women should have control over their own body … And she landed on freedom, which is a value that everybody cares about.” Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly ducked efforts to commit to vetoing a national abortion ban and baldly rejected comments made by JD Vance, his running mate, who said that Trump would veto such a ban. “Well, I didn’t discuss it with JD, in all fairness,” Trump said. Harris, too, was evasive in moments – when asked directly if she would support any restrictions on abortion, she reiterated her longstanding promise to support legislation to codify Roe into law, even though Roe didn’t stop states from enacting the restrictions that hacked away at access to the procedure. (It is also unlikely that Congress would pass such a bill anytime soon.) In an interview after the debate, Harris’s pick for vice-president, Tim Walz, also dodged questions about restrictions his boss may support. In the weeks since Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, abortion has become an increasingly key issue for women. A recent New York Times poll found that, among all women, it now rivals the economy in terms of importance and is the top voting issue among women under 45. A Harris campaign representative told Rolling Stone that in the first hour of the debate, 71% of grassroots donors to the campaign were women. “I think she litigated it just spectacularly well,” Lake said. “Two-thirds of the impact of the debate are the press interpretations afterward and the press has been even more positive. When you have Fox News criticizing Trump and saying there should be another debate, you know you’ve won.” Read more about the 2024 US election: Fact-checking the presidential debate Harris slams Trump for falsehoods in fiery debate Taylor Swift endorses Harris in post signed ‘childless cat lady’ ‘Maga mad libs’: How the debate played out on social media Presidential poll tracker","2024-09-11T13:37:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/11/abortion-harris-trump-debate"
"abortion","Trump’s IVF order: a PR move that gives pronatalists cause for cheer","During Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, as support for reproductive rights mounted, the president promised to force insurance companies to pay for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order that, the White House said, “expands access to in vitro fertilization”. “PROMISES MADE. PROMISES KEPT,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, posted in all-caps on Twitter/X. Resolve, the country’s leading infertility association, also applauded the order. “In our decades of advocacy, we have never seen an administration prioritize IVF as an issue impacting millions of Americans,” Barbara Collura, its president and CEO, said in a statement. “For this we are grateful.” The order, on its own, does not fulfill any campaign pledges. It does not change policy, much less make IVF free to people who want to grow their families. Instead, it is soliciting “policy recommendations to protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments”. It is, in many respects, a PR move – one that may alienate the anti-abortion movement, which largely opposes IVF, but further cements the Trump administration’s reputation for pronatalism. “The order recognizes the importance of family formation and that our nation’s public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children,” the order reads. Although Americans widely support access to IVF, the anti-abortion movement tends to oppose it on the grounds that it creates unused or discarded embryos (which they consider to be children). Predictably, anti-abortion activists revolted at news of Trump’s Tuesday order. “IVF turns children into a product to be created, sold, and discarded – violating their basic human rights,” Lila Rose, the leader of the anti-abortion group Live Action, posted on X. In another post, she added: “IVF is NOT pro-life.” But Trump is not as dependent on the support of the anti-abortion movement as he once was. Although the movement’s deep pockets and nationwide coordination were critical to his victory in the 2016 presidential election, Trump repeatedly wavered on abortion rights throughout his 2024 run. Although he took credit for the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade – which all three of his appointed justices supported – Trump also declined to support a nationwide abortion ban and, at one point, suggested that he would vote to restore abortion rights in Florida. (His campaign later walked back that promise.) Clearly, Trump’s lack of commitment to the anti-abortion cause didn’t hurt his campaign. If anything, it may have helped, given the mass outpouring of support for abortion rights in the years after Roe fell. Trump may have taken note: although anti-abortion activists had hoped that he would curb access to abortion pills or use a 19th-century anti-vice law to in effect ban abortion nationwide, Trump has done neither in the weeks since his return to the White House. But if they are disappointed in what he hasn’t done on abortion, they can take heart in mounting expressions of support from inside the administration on pronatalism, or the belief that declining birthrates are a threat to society and having babies contributes to the greater good. In his first speech as vice-president, JD Vance told the anti-abortion March for Life in January that he wants “more babies in the United States of America”. Billionaire Elon Musk, whose so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is now reportedly hacking away at the US government’s funding and staffing, has long championed pronatalism and is believed to have more than a dozen children. The Trump administration’s pronatalist devotion to “family formation”, however, seems to extend only so far – or, perhaps, only to specific kinds of parents. Stressing that IVF should be used by “longing mothers and fathers” leaves out LGBTQ+ families, who regularly rely on IVF. His administration’s plan to cut the funding of the National Institutes of Health and Science, the planet’s leading public funder of biomedical and behavioral research, threatens the future of efforts to curb maternal mortality, which is disproportionately high among Black and Indigenous women. (Those planned cuts are reportedly Doge’s work.) And the lack of direct action on IVF in Trump’s Tuesday order is striking, especially in the context of Trump’s other executive orders, which have issued sweeping – and potentially illegal – mandates to eliminate birthright citizenship and roll back the rights of transgender people. The order does not, for example, mandate private employers cover IVF in the way that they are required to cover contraception. “In the wake of all these other executive orders that do such dramatic things so fast, this one still leaves you anticipating what’s really the policy change gonna be,” said Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “If they start putting the pressure on private companies to include IVF that they put on them to dump DEI, maybe we see some change.” Still, Tipton added: “I would much rather have a policy that was thought out. I’m hopeful that they’re going to talk to the stakeholders, the experts, about what that policy should look like. And that’s going to take a little time.” The American Society for Reproductive Medicine would like to see the federal government mandate that employers cover IVF treatment. That kind of requirement, however, is probably only possible through legislation – and that’s unlikely to pass anytime soon. After an Alabama supreme court order last year declared that frozen embryos were “extrauterine children”, leading IVF providers in the state to halt their work, Republicans in Congress shut down a bill that would enshrine a federal right to IVF. While Trump’s alliance with the anti-abortion movement may be up in the air, many Republicans in Congress still depend on it to corral funding and votes. Still, Tipton said, there are changes that Trump could make immediately to expand IVF access – like, for example, providing all federal employees coverage for fertility treatments. Although the healthcare program that covers most civilian federal employees currently offers options for IVF coverage, Tricare – the healthcare program for the US military – does not, according to Resolve. “One big thing the president can do is role model for other employers,” Tipton said. “The federal government ought to do that.”","2025-02-19T18:26:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-ivf-executive-order"
"abortion","Texas supreme court rejects challenge to abortion ban over medical exceptions","The Texas supreme court on Friday rejected a challenge from more than 20 women who said they were denied medically necessary abortions under the state’s near-total abortion ban, ruling in an unanimous opinion that the state’s ban can stand as is. Two doctors had also joined the women’s case, which was the first post-Roe v Wade lawsuit to be filed by women who said that their health, lives or fertility had been endangered by abortions bans. Lawsuits filed by women in other states with near-total abortion bans, including Idaho and Tennessee, soon followed. The case did not seek to overturn Texas’s near-total abortion ban, but to amend it to clarify when medically necessary abortions can be performed. Although every US abortion ban technically permits abortions in medical emergencies, doctors in Texas and across the country have said that the wording of the bans – penned by politicians rather than medical professionals – is too vague and confusing to be workable in practice. Instead, these doctors say, they have been forced to wait and watch until patients get sick enough to intervene. In its ruling, the Republican-dominated Texas supreme court disagreed with those doctors. “Texas law permits a life-saving abortion,” wrote Justice Jane Bland, who authored the court’s opinion. Bland continued: “A physician who tells a patient, ‘Your life is threatened by a complication that has arisen during your pregnancy, and you may die, or there is a serious risk you will suffer substantial physical impairment unless an abortion is performed,’ and in the same breath states ‘but the law won’t allow me to provide an abortion in these circumstances’ is simply wrong in that legal assessment.” The woman who lent her name to the case, Amanda Zurawski, was 18 weeks into a much-wanted pregnancy when her water broke early – a development that doomed her chances of delivering a healthy baby. Although continuing the pregnancy posed significant risks to Zurawski’s health, her doctors said that they could not perform an abortion under Texas law because the fetus still had cardiac activity. Zurawski ended up developing sepsis and spending days in the intensive care unit. Other women who sued Texas said they were denied abortions even after their pregnancies were diagnosed with a litany of lethal conditions that would leave their fetuses with underdeveloped brains, skulls and other organs. Several fled the state for out-of-state abortions. One woman, Samantha Casiano, stayed in Texas and gave birth to a daughter, Halo, who struggled for air and died hours after birth. When Casiano recounted her experience in testimony last year, she threw up on the stand. Lauren Miller, another plaintiff in the case, was pregnant with twins when she learned one of the fetuses had severe abnormalities and would probably never make it to birth. Her pregnancy caused Miller to throw up uncontrollably, sending her to the emergency room twice. Despite the risks to her health, her doctors did not suggest an abortion. Miller ultimately received a fetal reduction, a procedure where doctors abort one fetus, in Colorado. She gave birth to a healthy son. When she read the Texas court’s opinion on Friday, Miller was shocked by how little she and the other women were mentioned. “I read it this morning. And then I reread it because I felt like something was missing. It was when I reread it and saw it the second time, I was like: ‘We’re missing. We are erased from our own case,’” Miller said. She said that, after reading the ruling, she gave her young son a hug. “It was just registration, once again, about how little not just my life mattered, but how little his life mattered to the Texas supreme court.” Last year, a Travis county judge had issued a court order in the case that allowed doctors to perform abortions if they determined through “good faith judgment” that the procedure was necessary. That order was immediately put on hold due to an appeal by the Texas attorney general’s office. Friday’s order vacates the order completely. Although the Friday ruling will not legally affect the lawsuits in other states, abortion rights advocates had hoped that a favorable ruling from the Texas state supreme court could help, because the medical exemptions in abortion bans are often written with very similar language. In light of Friday’s ruling, Miller urged people to vote for candidates who support abortion rights come November. Multiple members of the Texas supreme court are up for re-election this year. “I’m going to be sad today. I’m going to be bummed. But then we’re gonna have a weekend,” she said. “I’m not done fighting.”","2024-05-31T16:12:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/31/texas-abortion-ban-medical-exceptions-supreme-court-ruling"
"abortion","Biased laws and poverty driving huge rise in female prisoners – report","Poverty, abuse and discriminatory laws are driving a huge rise in the number of women in prison globally, according to a new report. With the rise of the far right and an international backlash against women’s rights, the research said there was a risk that laws would increasingly be used to target women, forcing more behind bars. More than 733,000 women are in prisons around the world and the number is growing much faster than rates of incarcerated men. Since 2000, the number of women and girls in prison has grown by 57%, compared with a 22% increase in the male prison population. The first global report of its kind, to which the Guardian was given exclusive access before its launch on 17 March, examined how laws criminalised acts of survival. Women were disproportionately jailed for petty theft, such as stealing food for babies and children, for begging and for working in the informal economy. They were also frequently detained for debt, in violation of international law, said the report by Penal Reform International and Women Beyond Walls. Sabrina Mahtani, from Women Beyond Walls, said: “Prison is not a safe space for women or their children. Yet, rather than investing in support services and community solutions, countries continue to criminalise those who are marginalised and vulnerable.” Sia Fatmata Deen, a former police officer and president of the Freetown chapter of Go Bifo (Moving Forward) in Sierra Leone, a network of women who have spent time in prison, was detained in 2013 for more than a year after a misunderstanding at work. A bike that had been reported stolen was being held at the police station overnight and went missing. Deen was held liable and asked to pay 5.5m leone (£186). When she was unable to pay, she was imprisoned until she could get the money. Many women Deen has met have been arrested, detained and labelled as criminals for acts stemming from poverty. The two most common offences women are charged with in the country are “fraudulent conversion” (using someone else’s money or property for illegal purposes) and “obtaining goods or money by false pretence” – both fall under the colonial-era Larceny Act. Civil society organisations said the offences were misunderstood and the colonial-era law was being used to criminalise almost any instance of debt. Other women who were imprisoned under the act included victims of domestic abuse and those who had resorted to sex work or selling drugs to provide for their families. Deen said: “More women are going to prison because of poverty. If you have money, you will not go and sell drugs. If you have money, you will not go and borrow microfinance loans. “Women are the ones that have needs to take care of, and if we don’t have the money to do so, we’ll do extraordinary things. And then we’ll have conflict with the law,” she said. “There is a poor justice system in Sierra Leone.” Women around the world continue to be arrested under colonial-era laws, including those criminalising abortion, suicide attempts and same-sex relations. Although many of these laws appear gender-neutral, they disproportionately impact women due to patriarchal norms and systemic gender discrimination. In several countries, laws criminalising witchcraft mostly affected women who do not conform to gender stereotypes, said the report, with unmarried women, widows, divorcees or those without children – particularly older and poorer individuals – particularly targeted. Women’s choices about their dress and appearance were also frequently restricted by laws. In May 2022, a Zambian businesswoman and social media influencer, Iris Kaingu, was arrested and charged with “indecent dressing”, after attending a fashion event wearing a see-through black dress. In Iran, not wearing a hijab was already a criminal offence under the Islamic penal code, but new morality laws introduced last year allowed significant fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years or even the death penalty for “promoting nudity, indecency, unveiling or improper dressing”. The report warned that the female prison population could soon exceed one million, and called for wider collection of data on the topic, more alternatives to prison and decriminalising laws that violate human rights standards and international law.","2025-03-12T06:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/12/biased-laws-poverty-debt-abortion-female-prisoners-penal-reform-report"
"abortion","New York attorney general sues facilities promoting ‘abortion pill reversal’","The organization behind an international network of anti-abortion facilities is misleading people with claims that abortions can be “reversed”, a lawsuit filed on Monday by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, alleges. The organization, Heartbeat International, is affiliated with more than 2,000 facilities that aim to convince people to continue their pregnancies. In recent years, many such centers, which are often Christian and sometimes known as crisis pregnancy centers, have started to promote a controversial practice known as “abortion pill reversal”, which claims that people can halt a medication abortion midway through. The first randomized, controlled clinical study to attempt to study this “reversal” protocol’s effectiveness came to an abrupt stop in 2019, after three participants landed in the hospital hemorrhaging blood. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the pre-eminent membership group for OB-GYNS, has said that claims about abortion reversal are “not based on science and do not meet clinical standards”. James’s lawsuit accuses Heartbeat International and a slew of New York-based crisis pregnancy centers of making claims about abortion pill reversal that violate New York laws against deceptive business practices, false advertising and fraud. The lawsuit calls for the defendants to pay thousands of dollars in civil penalties. “Obtaining accurate information can be especially difficult in the context of reproductive healthcare, where opponents of abortion intentionally distort and obfuscate facts to convince, scare, shame, or guilt people facing unintended pregnancy into deciding not to obtain or complete abortions at a moment when they are particularly vulnerable,” alleges James’s lawsuit. When it comes to abortion pill reversal, the lawsuit continues: “Defendants’ consumer-oriented statements distort the evidence and mislead New Yorkers to undergo this experimental ‘treatment’, believing that it has been proven safe and effective, when it has not.” Heartbeat International did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Last week, Heartbeat International and the other centers named in James’s lawsuit fired a pre-emptive legal strike against the attorney general, who had alerted the organization of her plan to sue days beforehand. They filed a lawsuit that accused the Democrat of waging “a politically motivated campaign against pregnancy organizations in general” and trampling over the anti-abortion organizations’ rights to free speech and free exercise of religion. The lawsuit also denied that any of the crisis pregnancy centers associated with the case had made any false or misleading statements about abortion pill reversal. Abortion rights supporters have spent years struggling to regulate crisis pregnancy centers and claims about abortion pill reversal, because these centers operate within a kind of regulatory dead zone. Many are not licensed medical clinics, so they aren’t subject to the kind of oversight usually imposed on such clinics (such as abortion clinics). At the same time, since the centers are usually faith-based, judges are reluctant to infringe on their religious rights. Crisis pregnancy centers’ promotion of abortion pill reversal works in tandem with their demonization of medication abortion, according to James’ lawsuit. Medication abortion, which is typically induced using doses of two different drugs, now accounts for more than 60% of US abortions and has become a prime target of anti-abortion activists since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago. Medication abortion typically entails two drugs: mifepristone, which blocks progesterone, a hormone required for a pregnancy to continue, and misoprostol, which causes the uterus to empty and contract. If a woman takes mifepristone and regrets it before taking misoprostol, activists who support abortion pill reversal say that she can skip the second drug and instead take doses of progesterone to counter the effects of mifepristone. Dr George Delgado, who helped develop the abortion pill reversal protocol, is now one of the doctors challenging the availability of mifepristone in a US supreme court case. The justices are expected to issue an opinion on that case in June. More than 100 studies have found that it is safe to use mifepristone to end a pregnancy.","2024-05-06T21:51:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/06/new-york-attorney-general-anti-abortion-pill-lawsuit-letitia-james"
"abortion","US destruction of contraceptives denies 1.4m African women and girls lifesaving care, NGO says","A decision by the US government to incinerate more than $9.7m (£7.3m) of contraceptives is projected to result in 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions in five African countries. More than three-quarters of the contraceptives (77%) were destined for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Mali, according to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), an NGO global healthcare provider and advocate of sexual and reproductive rights. The contraceptives, many of which will not expire until 2027-29, had already been manufactured, packaged and ready for distribution. IPPF offered to take them for redistribution at no cost to the US taxpayer, but the offer was declined. Their destruction will deny more than 1.4 million women and girls in the five countries access to lifesaving care, IPPF said. Marie Evelyne Petrus-Barry, the Africa regional director of IPPF, said: “This decision to destroy ready-to-use commodities is appalling and extremely wasteful. These lifesaving medical supplies were destined to countries where access to reproductive care is already limited, and in some cases, part of a broader humanitarian response, such as in the DRC. The choice to incinerate them is unjustifiable.” As a result of the decision, more than 1m injectable contraceptives and 365,100 implants will not be distributed in Tanzania, 28% of the total annual need in the country. Dr Bakari, a project coordinator at Umati, IPPF’s member association in Tanzania, said: “We are facing a major challenge. The impact of the USAID funding cuts has already significantly affected the provision of sexual and reproductive health services in Tanzania, leading to a shortage of contraceptive commodities, especially implants. This shortage has directly impacted clients’ choices regarding family planning uptake.” In Mali, women will be denied access to 1.2m oral contraceptives and 95,800 implants, amounting to almost a quarter (24%) of the country’s annual need. In Zambia, women will go without 48,400 implants and 295,000 injectable contraceptives, while in Kenya 108,000 women will not have access to contraceptive implants. Nelly Munyasia, the executive director for the Reproductive Health Network in Kenya, said the impact of USAID cuts was already being felt in the country. Stockpiles of long-term contraceptives had already run out, she said, which will have drastic consequences on women’s health and their sexual and reproductive rights. Meanwhile, the skill set of health workers is being reduced and there is a 46% funding gap in Kenya’s national family planning programme. “These systemic setbacks come at a time when unmet need for contraception remains high,” she said. “Nearly one in five girls aged 15 to 19 are already pregnant or has given birth. Unsafe abortions remain among the five leading causes of maternal deaths in Kenya. While the Kenyan constitution, adopted in 2010, allows for abortion when a pregnant person’s life or health is at risk, the Kenyan penal code of 1963 still criminalises it. Healthcare providers are reluctant to provide safe care while the penal code remains in place, even in emergencies. Munyasia said without adequate supplies of contraceptives there would be a rise in maternal mortality as a result of women seeking to end unintended pregnancies. Last month, a US state department spokesperson confirmed that the decision to destroy the contraceptives had been made. Amid reports that the contraceptives were due to be incinerated in France, the French government said it was “following the situation closely” after feminist, rights and family planning groups expressed outrage at the proposal. The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organisations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson.","2025-08-06T16:24:39Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/us-destruction-contraceptives-denies-african-women-girls-lifesaving-care-ngo"
"abortion","Louisiana’s move to criminalize abortion pills is cruel and medically senseless","This week, Louisiana moved to expand the criminalization of abortion further than any state has since before Roe v Wade was decided. On Thursday, the state legislature passed a bill that would reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol – the two drugs used in a majority of American abortions – as dangerous controlled substances. Under both state and federal classifications, the category of controlled substances includes those medications known to cause mind-altering effects and create the potential for addictions, such as sedatives and opioids; abortion medications carry none of this potential for physical dependence, habit-forming or abuse. The move from Louisiana lawmakers runs counter to both established medical opinion and federal law. Jeff Landry, the anti-choice Republican governor, is expected to sign the bill. When he does, possession of mifepristone or misoprostol in Louisiana will come to carry large fines and up to 10 years in prison. Louisiana already has a total abortion ban, with no rape or incest exceptions. But the Louisiana lawmakers are pursuing this new additional criminalization measure because while abortion bans are very good at generating suffering for women, they are not very good at actually preventing abortions. Data from the Guttmacher Institute suggests that the United States saw an 11% increase in abortions between 2020 and 2023 – a possible indication that pregnant people are still managing to obtain abortions in spite of post-Dobbs bans. As was the case in the pre-Roe era, women have continued to seek out ways to end their pregnancies, even in defiance of abortion ban laws. In the pre-Roe era, illegal abortions were often unsafe, and abortion bans caused a public health crisis: many hospitals had to open septic abortion wards, where women who had had incompetent or careless illegal abortions were treated for frequently life-threatening conditions. But the post-Dobbs reality is that advances in communications technology and medicine mean that illegal abortions need no longer be unsafe ones. Now, women living in states with abortion bans can access safe, effective abortion care in the comfort of their own homes, and often law enforcement and anti-choice zealots are none the wiser. Women can perform their own abortions, safely and effectively, without regard to the law’s opinion on whether they should be free to. They can do this because they can access the pills. The criminalization measure, then, is part of an expanding horizon of invasive, sadistic and burdensome state interventions meant to do the impossible: to stop women from trying to control their own lives. The Louisiana bill nominally will not apply to pregnant women – they’re exempted from criminal punishments for possession of the medications. But it will take square aims at the vital, heroic efforts of feminists, medical practitioners and mutual aid networks that have been distributing the pills in Louisiana: the people who have adhered to the principles of bodily autonomy and women’s self-determination even amid a hostile climate. These people’s courage and integrity is the greatest threat to the anti-choice regime, and so it is these people whom Louisiana’s new medical criminalization law will be used against first. But pro-abortion rights and women’s rights activists are not the only ones who will be hurt by the new law. For one thing, the criminalization of possession is likely to scare many Louisiana abortion seekers out of ordering the pills online, even if the bill itself technically excludes them from prosecution. These abortion seekers, dissuaded and threatened out of seeking the most reliable and safe method of self-managed abortion, may then turn to less safe options. But the new drug classification also has implications for a wide array of healthcare treatments. Mifepristone and misoprostol are not only used in elective abortions. They are also the standard of care for spontaneous miscarriages – the management of which has already become legally fraught for doctors in Louisiana, causing women to suffer needlessly and endanger their health. Misoprostol is used in labor, too, and in the treatment of some ulcers. The drugs’ needless, cruel and medically senseless reclassification as “controlled” substances will make these medical practices more difficult in a state that already has one of the worst rates of maternal mortality in the country. That’s part of why more than 200 Louisiana physicians signed a letter opposing the bill. The Republican legislators who have pushed the new criminalization do not pretend to actually believe that abortion drugs are habit-forming. Thomas Pressly, the state senator who introduced the bill, frankly said that his aim was to “control the rampant illegal distribution of abortion-inducing drugs”. But there is something to the notion that abortion access might be “habit-forming”. In the Roe era, after all, women began to conceive of themselves as full persons, able to exercise control over their own destinies – as adults, that is, with all the privileges and entitlements of citizenship. They formed a habit of independence, a habit of imagining themselves as people entitled to freedom, equality, self-determination and respect. It is these habits that the Republican party is trying to break them of.

"abortion","Republicans omit national abortion ban from platform for first time in 40 years","The Republican party has omitted a national abortion ban from its official party platform for the first time in 40 years, opting instead to focus on the power of states to regulate abortion in a move that reflects Donald Trump’s preferred position. Fourteen states have adopted near-total abortion bans since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, ending the federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion. The party’s new policy platform is the first since Trump won the White House in 2016, and is significantly slimmer, down from 66 pages to 16. In the 2020 race, which Trump went on to lose to Joe Biden, the party did not adopt a new platform. The document – approved within a few hours on Monday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the party will hold its convention next week – includes many slogans that will be familiar to Trump supporters. On oil production, for instance, it says the president will “drill baby drill”. The 20-point plan, written in all-capital letters, lays out an agenda that includes a pledge to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion”, as well as continue building a border wall that Trump promised during his presidency but largely failed to deliver. It also promises to “end inflation and make America great again”, to enact tax cuts for workers with “no tax on tips” and to make college campuses “safe” by deporting so-called “pro-Hamas radicals”. The platform repeatedly criticizes policies to empower transgender individuals, specifically their involvement in sports. It also promises to repeal emissions regulations on gas vehicles and to build an “Iron Dome”, a reference to Israel’s anti-missile defense system. It pledges to ensure “election integrity” with new voting restrictions, end “gender insanity” and support for trans inclusion policies, “stop woke” government and “protect free speech” online. Notably, Republicans also said they would “welcome” greater political participation from US territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam. On abortion, the policy document starts by saying that the president would support the 14th amendment, which generally provides the right to due process. “We believe that the 14th amendment to the constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights,” it says. Anti-abortion activists have long argued the amendment should be interpreted by courts to include fetuses in utero, thereby guaranteeing “personhood” rights. Such an interpretation would probably make many aspects of in vitro fertilization (IVF) illegal, similar to how Alabama’s supreme court threw IVF into turmoil this spring. The document continues: “After 51 years, because of us, that power [to regulate abortion] has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” It adds that Republicans would oppose “late term abortion” – a non-medical term used in the political sphere to generally mean abortion past 20 weeks’ gestation – and that the party would support “mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF”. The aspirations of those who helped craft the president’s platform on abortion are significantly more radical than what the policy document lays out. Kristi Hamrick, a representative of Students for Life who told Catholic News Agency (CNA) she has been working with the Trump campaign, said activists are already considering how a prospective second Trump administration could advance these goals. “If we de-tangled and cut out the cancer of abortion and abortion-related programming from our federal budgets, we can have a healthier budget and a life-affirming budget,” Hamrick told CNA. That work would, in Hamrick’s words, constitute “a very vibrant and vigorous term”, for anti-abortion activists. In communications to the broader public, anti-abortion activists have generally leaned toward more ambiguous language about their goals. Popular support for abortion rights has risen since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. A national poll released this week by the Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research finds a solid majority of Americans oppose a national abortion ban, and a rising number support the procedure for any reason. Democrats responded to the new Republican platform by pointing out that the architects of the 20-point plan were also connected to the controversial Project 2025, a plan Trump has publicly disavowed but shares a joint vision with the president’s statements. “Trump is so desperate to distance himself from Project 2025 as the American people are grappling with the terrifying truth about his second-term agenda that he and his team overhauled the Republican platform process to keep the public and the press in the dark, all caps-ed 20 bullet points behind closed doors, and blasted it out to divert attention from his real plans,” said the Democratic National Committee press secretary, Emilia Rowland. Rowland continued: “The American people know that Trump wants a nationwide abortion ban and they know the only thing standing in the way of Trump’s terrifying second term agenda is re-electing President Biden and Vice-President [Kamala] Harris in November.”","2024-07-09T14:38:25Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/09/republican-abortion-ban-policy-platform-trump"
"abortion","Harris urges Americans to vote after six-week abortion ban takes effect in Iowa","Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, urged Americans to vote after a six-week abortion ban took effect in Iowa on Monday. “This ban is going to take effect before many women even know they’re pregnant,” Harris said in a video posted to YouTube. “What this means is that one in three women of reproductive age in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.” During the 33-second clip, Harris used the phrase “Trump abortion ban” three times – part of a wider effort by her campaign to blame her rival Donald Trump, who appointed three of the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade and enabled states to outlaw abortion, for the spate of unpopular bans that now blanket the south and midwest. The Republican-dominated Iowa state legislature passed the ban last year, but a lengthy court battle initially stopped it from taking effect. Last month, the Iowa supreme court ruled that the ban could be enforced, leading a lower-court judge to rule it could take effect on Monday morning at 8am local time. “The upholding of this abortion ban in Iowa is an absolute devastation and violation of human rights, depriving Iowans of their bodily autonomy,” Leah Vanden Bosch, development and outreach director of the Iowa Abortion Access Fund, said in a statement. “We know a ban will not stop the need for abortions.” Up until Sunday, abortion had been legal in Iowa up to roughly 22 weeks of pregnancy. Now, abortion clinics in the state have indicated that they will continue offering the procedure to the legal limit. The closest options for Iowans who want abortions after six weeks of pregnancy will probably be Minnesota and Illinois, Democratic-run states that border Iowa and that have become abortion havens since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. The Iowa ban permits abortions past six weeks in cases of rape or incest, or in medical emergencies. Fourteen other states enacted near-total bans on abortion since the US supreme court overturned Roe. Three other states – Georgia, South Carolina and Florida – have banned abortion past about six weeks of pregnancy. Roe’s demise led to surge in support for abortion rights, even in red states. Sixty-one per cent of Iowans, including 70% of women, say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll found last year. The end of Roe has made abortion rights one of the top issues in the 2024 election. Harris, the face of the issue for Democrats, has said that she would sign a bill codifying Roe’s protections into law. On the other side of the aisle, Trump, the Republican nominee has tried to downplay the issue as it has become a liability for Republicans. Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s Republican governor, celebrated the ban, calling it a “victory for life”. In a statement, she added: “There is nothing more sacred and no cause more worthy than protecting innocent unborn lives.”","2024-07-29T18:40:59Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/29/iowa-six-week-abortion-ban"
"abortion","NSW health system ‘not capable’ of providing abortions at all public hospitals, advocates say","Even if the New South Wales government were to order all public hospitals to fulfil their obligation to provide abortion, the state’s public health system would not be capable of doing so as too many doctors are untrained or opposed, a leading reproductive choice charity says. The managing director of Marie Stopes International (MSI) Australia, Greg Johnson, said some abortion care could be provided by GPs and other health professionals in primary care settings, but a significant proportion was surgical and required day hospital admission. “Currently the NSW public health system is not capable of providing surgical abortion care at every hospital,” Johnson said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “There are simply not enough doctors and nurses trained and experienced in abortion care. Also, many doctors, nurse and health service managers do not want to participate in abortion care due to personal beliefs or stigma they will experience. “It will be many years before sufficient doctors and nurses could be available and support much broader public hospital service provision.” While abortion in NSW is decriminalised, just three of the state’s 220 public hospitals are providing it, despite the World Health Organization recommending all public hospitals do so. Johnson said he believed the best approach to improve affordable access to abortion was for NSW Health to support a partnership between the public hospitals, health services and non-profit, private providers that specialise in abortion and contraception care. “This would mean public hospitals have clear, documented and effective referral pathways to enable women who seek access at a public hospital to gain timely referral to an accredited abortion service provider,” he said. “Financial assistance should be provided from public hospital budgets … this should include subsidised cost of the procedure and travel and related costs as required.” As Guardian Australia previously reported, none of the 15 NSW health districts could provide details about referral pathways for abortions when women are denied one in a public hospital. The ACT, Queensland and WA governments and health departments all provide financial support and referral pathways to MSI Australia and other abortion services. But data published by Guardian Australia on Tuesday revealed that access to abortion in NSW remains poor. A former senior medical officer at a regional local health district, who spoke to Guardian Australian on condition of anonymity, agreed with MSI that too many doctors remain unwilling to provide abortion. “We had an incident where a woman had a failed medical abortion, and needed a surgical abortion at 12 weeks,” he said. “A general surgeon at the time gloated about how he and one other gynaecologist, both Catholic and strongly opposed to abortion, had effectively banned abortion in that hospital for about seven years. They had effectively bullied staff over many years, to prevent surgical abortion access at the facility.” Even though by law conscientious objectors must provide information about how to contact or locate a different medical practitioner, the former senior medical officer said this was not happening, and the lack of providers generally made onward referral difficult. He said he made it clear to the objectors they were breaking the law and that the woman needed care. “But I have no idea what happened after I left the service,” he said. “Doctors have more power than most people think. “The majority of public decisions are actually made in private outpatient clinics. It would be inconceivably difficult to change that system quickly, both practically, but also politically.” Dr Madeleine Belfrage, from the University of Sydney’s Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre, said it was clear “conscientious objection provisions” were being misused. “It’s clear from this example that conscientious objection provisions, which allow individual clinicians to decline to participate in abortion procedures, are being misused by institutions and people in positions of power to obstruct access and shut down services,” she said. “The NSW government needs to implement a state-wide policy to ensure that public hospitals fulfil their duty of care and ensure timely and quality services are available for all people who live in NSW.” “Sending directives to individual hospitals does not go far enough to ensure that services are available across the state.”","2024-12-20T14:00:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/21/nsw-health-system-not-capable-of-providing-abortions-at-all-public-hospitals-advocates-say"
"abortion","Global health charities warn of ‘huge and terrible’ threat to abortion rights if Trump returns","Providers of women’s healthcare around the world are preparing for potentially disastrous consequences should Donald Trump win the US presidential election in November. Policies pursued during Trump’s last presidency caused “devastating” harm in a number of countries, said Beth Schlachter, a senior director at MSI Reproductive Choices in the US. It meant “clinics shuttered, health teams closed, women dying … but a second Trump term will be on a different scale”. Global health charities lost US funding if they refused to agree not to “perform or actively promote abortion” under the “global gag rule”. This frequently meant the closure of facilities offering wider health services, such as family planning. Joe Biden scrapped the ban in 2021 a week after he was inaugurated as US president in a move celebrated by health groups around the world. However, rightwing US strategists have set out detailed plans in their Project 2025 roadmap for a Republican administration to change the way the US government operates immediately after a Trump victory. They are pushing for even wider restrictions on the activities of any organisation receiving US funding, the withdrawal of American support from international agencies, and the country’s influence to be used to further restrict access to abortions globally. Schlachter said the sector needed “to get our heads around the implications of Trump retaking the White House”. Efforts by Trump to distance himself from Project 2025 were disingenuous, she suggested. “These are his people and they are telling us loud and clear the damage they intend to inflict.” The global gag rule requiring organisations receiving US funding for family-planning services to agree not to perform or actively promote abortion has existed under Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan. The Trump administration went further, however, and made that agreement a condition for organisations to receive US funding for global healthcare in general. The Project 2025 papers suggest the next Republican president should go further still and apply the gag rule “to all foreign assistance, including humanitarian aid”. This would affect about $51bn (£40bn) in overseas aid at current levels, health policy analysts suggest. Such an expansion would be “huge and terrible”, said Dr Marleen Temmerman, a professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Aga Khan University East Africa and former director of reproductive health at the World Health Organization (WHO). Under Trump’s last administration, US funding for research into subjects such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes was imperilled by the provision of abortions for foetal malformation at the university’s hospital, she said. Dr Carole Sekimpi, the senior Africa director for MSI Reproductive Choices, said the 2017 gag rule was “disastrous for women”. “If anything, it increases the number of abortions – because you have more and more women with limited access to contraception, limited access to information, and therefore with a higher likelihood of unplanned pregnancies, and therefore the need for an abortion,” she said. The gag rule had a wider chilling effect, Sekimpi added. “It does really embolden the opposition. Those who are anti-rights, anti-choice – the hate movement.” Temmerman said organisations would need to work together and potentially hive off work in reproductive healthcare into separate organisations to safeguard their other projects. The US is responsible for almost two-thirds of global funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights promotion, according to a report by the German Foundation for World Population (DSW), a family-planning charity. During the last Trump presidency, MSI saw annual donor income drop by $30m – or 17% – because it refused to sign the global gag rule. The charity said that meant 8 million women lost access to family-planning services – resulting in an estimated 6m unintended pregnancies, 1.8m unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths. The Guttmacher Institute published a study looking at the impact in Uganda and Ethiopia, which found the global gag rule “stalled and even reversed progress toward expanded access to modern contraception”. In Nepal, MSI had been working with the government to expand family-planning services, training health workers and establishing clinics. “Everything changed after the election of Donald Trump,” said Tushar Niroula, operations director at MSI Nepal. “The operation had to be gradually closed down.” The proportion of women of reproductive age in Nepal using modern contraceptives had stagnated, he said. “Underprivileged populations in hard-to-reach areas are not able to get the access to the services. That’s the effect of the global gag rule.” Partner agencies were afraid to refer women to MSI for abortion care even in cases of rape, incest or where the mother’s life was at risk, which were all exceptions to the global gag rule, the charity said, adding that desperate women would opt for unsafe methods. “It’s devastating,” Niroula said. “We have seen a lot of cases where women have opted for traditional methods of abortion and have got complications, and have nearly died.” Documents published by Project 2025 suggest membership of international organisations such as the UN and WHO should be seen as only “a means to attain defined goals” and stress that withdrawal is an option “when such institutions act against US interests”. The US should work with a coalition of “like-minded nations” to shape the work of international agencies, building on the anti-abortion Geneva Consensus Declaration signed by the last Trump administration and 33 largely illiberal or authoritarian governments, they suggest. The US rescinded its signature a few months afterwards after Trump left office. Individuals linked to the last Trump administration and to Project 2025 are already working in countries including Guatemala and Uganda to embed policies based on that declaration, according to analysis by the reproductive rights group Ipas.","2024-08-16T11:00:16Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/16/global-health-charities-warning-threat-global-gag-rule-abortion-rights-family-planning-women-trump-project-2025"
"abortion","Harris campaign centers healthcare and abortion rights: ‘If she wins, it’s because of Dobbs’","Kamala Harris is staking out health, and especially reproductive rights and affordable healthcare, as a central issue in her historic campaign for the US presidency, experts say. The first ad for the Harris campaign, released on Thursday, prioritized bodily autonomy, safety from gun violence, and affordable healthcare alongside issues like child poverty and the rule of law. Reproductive rights will be “far and away” the driving focus of Harris’s health-related messages – and her entire campaign – as well as prioritization of affordable healthcare and medications, according to Drew Altman, president of KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization. “If Harris wins this election, I think it would be because of abortion bans and because of Dobbs,” said Greer Donley, associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. “Abortion is a huge issue this election cycle … and I think it will really help the campaign to capitalize on all of the momentum and all of the rage and anger about abortion bans.” In the wake of the Dobbs decision overturning the right to abortion, the Biden-Harris administration has “done an extraordinary job on this issue with the tools that they have”, said Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. The administration solidified telehealth access for abortion, allowed veterans affairs hospitals to provide abortion counseling and services, clarified the Hipaa privacy rules to make sure health employees don’t give protected information to law enforcement, and made sure that abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth and other reproductive healthcare are entitled to accommodations under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. “They did a lot,” Donley said. In other aspects of health, the administration has built on the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid program to expand coverage and affordability, and began negotiating Medicare drug pricing. “We have seen a real improvement in the numbers of people who have health insurance, and new resources to make health insurance more affordable,” Corlette said. “I would expect a Harris administration to try to build on and expand the gains in the Affordable Care Act,” also known as Obamacare. Harris’ campaign would probably go on the offense, Altman said, calling out Trump’s policies and proposals to cut immensely popular health programs and contrasting them with gains over the past three years. Her posture probably “will be characterized much more by attacking Trump on positions she’ll claim he will take on healthcare than by advancing her own healthcare positions”, Altman said. As a senator, Harris was the first to co-sponsor the Medicare for All legislation put forward by the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, and as a presidential candidate in 2020, she unveiled her own version of a similar plan. In her time in Congress, Harris also sponsored a bill to prohibit certain abortion restrictions and she introduced a bill to require public and private health insurers to cover medications that prevent HIV infections. But “I don’t think the past is going to be terribly relevant”, Altman said. As a presidential candidate, Harris needed to rally the base and appeal to undecided voters, he said. “I would expect her to continue the kind of aggressive incrementalism that we’ve seen from the Biden administration.” One of the first healthcare battles facing a Harris administration would be the extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits originally enacted in 2021, now scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, Corlette said. “That’s going to be a really important, critical battle, and I expect that she will champion a permanent extension of those – because that’s just had a huge impact on the affordability of health insurance coverage for a lot of people.” Republicans have proposed capping and cutting Medicaid, a “very popular” program that covers almost 90 million Americans, Altman said. Some conservative Republican groups have also put forward fundamental changes to Medicare, which Altman calls “politically a sacrosanct program”. Trump and Vance have proposed weakening protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which are “immensely popular”, Altman said, as well as major changes to or even repealing the Affordable Care Act. Republican groups have also revived a focus on tax-preferred health savings accounts, in an effort to make healthcare more consumer-driven. “What you’d likely see under a Trump administration is a dismantling of the federal government’s involvement in healthcare,” Corlette said. Yet “one of the biggest pain points for Americans right now is the cost of healthcare – not just the cost of health insurance, but actually the cost when they go to the hospital or go to the doctor,” she said. On abortion, Trump has proposed leaving the issue to the states – nearly one-third of which have total abortion bans. “That is not a position that is consistent with the majority of the American people,” Donley said. “It’s radical.” Trump’s abortion plank also invokes fetal personhood, which could make abortion, IVF procedures, and miscarriages prosecutable as murder. The concept of fetal personhood, wherein a zygote, embryo or fetus has the same rights as people, is “very scary. It’s scary as everyone suggests it is, and not just for abortion,” Donley said. While Biden’s administration has made major strides on abortion, “it’s never been an issue that I think he personally has felt comfortable with,” Corlette said. Biden rarely even says the word “abortion”. Harris, on the other hand, has been much more outspoken about reproductive rights. Whoever wins this election could one day nominate new justices to the US supreme court, if some of the older justices were to leave the court. “If Harris serves eight years, then she has the potential to really change the composition of the supreme court,” Donley said. “That could be a method to get Dobbs overturned. And obviously that would have implications that are far bigger than abortion.”","2024-07-29T10:00:16Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/29/kamala-harris-abortion-rights-healthcare"
"abortion","Pope Leo condemns US’s ‘extremely disrespectful’ treatment of immigrants","Pope Leo has reiterated his disapproval of Donald Trump’s immigration policies, saying foreigners in the US are being treated in an “extremely disrespectful way”. Leo, the first US pontiff in the history of the Catholic church, made the remarks in response to questions about a statement adopted last week during a special assembly of US bishops that criticised the Trump administration’s mass deportations and lamented the fear and anxiety caused by immigration raids. Leo said the statement was “very important” and urged Catholics to take heed. “I think we have to look for ways of treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have,” he told reporters as he left the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, a hilltop town south of Rome, on Tuesday. “If people are in the United States illegally, there are ways to treat that. There are courts; there’s a system of justice.” Leo acknowledged that “every country has a right to determine who and how and when people enter”. “But when people are living good lives, and many of them for 10, 15, 20 years, to treat them in a way that is extremely disrespectful, to say the least – and there’s been some violence, unfortunately – I think that the bishops have been very clear in what they said,” he added. Leo, who was elected in May after the death of Pope Francis, has in recent weeks adopted an increasingly strong tone in his criticism of Trump’s immigration policies. In September, he called the US’s treatment of immigrants “inhuman” and in October he questioned whether Trump’s policies were in line with the Catholic church’s teachings. “Someone who says I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don’t know if that’s pro-life,” he said. On that occasion, he was also speaking from Castel Gandolfo, to which he usually retreats on Monday afternoons and Tuesdays. The Chicago-born pontiff revived papal holidays in Castel Gandolfo this summer after the tradition was interrupted by Pope Francis, who preferred to spend his time off at a Vatican guesthouse. On Tuesday, Leo also issued a strongly worded video on the climate crisis to bishops participating in the Cop30 summit in Brazil. Criticising the failure of international leaders to summon the political will to tackle the problem, he said: “Creation is crying out in floods, droughts, storms and relentless heat. One in three people live in great vulnerability because of these climate changes.” He referred to the landmark Paris agreement, adopted by the international community in 2015 to address the climate crisis, as the “strongest tool for protecting people and the planet”. “It is not the agreement that is failing; we are failing in our response,” he said. “What is failing is the political will of some. True leadership means service, and support at a scale that will make a difference.”","2025-11-19T13:21:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/pope-leo-donald-trump-immigration-policy-us"
"abortion","Melania Trump is right that the robots are here – but she’s wrong on how to handle it","MelanAI is coming for your kids “The robots are here,” proclaimed Melania Trump during an AI event at the White House on Thursday. It can be hard to parse the first lady’s poker face and expressionless voice, but this certainly wasn’t a statement of regret. Rather Trump, reading from a script encased in a very analogue binder, was taking it upon herself to help America’s children navigate AI, which she touted as the “greatest engine of progress in the history of the United States of America”. “As leaders and parents, we must manage AI’s growth responsibly,” she said in her speech. “During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children.” Does that mean foisting them off to a nanny or, as Donald Trump once did with Donald Trump Jr, abandoning them at the airport because they’re five minutes late? No, it means “empowering, but with watchful guidance”, apparently. Melania Trump doesn’t grace the White House with her presence particularly often. The first lady has made clear that she is not beholden to things like “duty” or “tradition” like her predecessors. She does what she wants, when she wants. And Thursday’s roundtable on AI is the latest indication that she wants to position herself as a leading figure in the future of technology. Like the rest of her family, the first lady has enthusiastically embraced NFTs and cryptocurrency – and their amazing ability to rapidly generate the Trumps an immense amount of wealth. She’s also boasted about using an AI version of her voice to narrate the audiobook version of Melania. And last month she launched an AI contest for kids in grades K-12. The first lady isn’t just positioning herself as a leading voice in technology; she’s trying to brand herself as the face of responsible innovation. While announcing her AI contest for kids, for example, she boasted that she’d “championed online safety through the Take It Down Act” (TDA). It’s true that Melania advocated for the TDA, which passed Congress with bipartisan support earlier this year and criminalizes the nonconsensual distribution of intimate imagery (NDII, once known as “revenge porn”.) Nevertheless, the legislation is rather more complicated than she’d have it seem. Image-base sexual abuse (both authentic imagery and AI-generated content) is a serious problem that scholars and activists have been trying to address via legislation for a long time. While it’s commendable that Trump wanted to get involved with the TDA, some people believe she swooped in at the last minute and put her name to a dangerously bastardized version of a model statute that experts developed. Numerous civil rights activists have warned that the TDA has been broadened so much that it will be weaponized against free speech. “I am gratified that the [TDA] incorporates much of the language of the model federal statute against NDII I first drafted in 2013,” wrote Dr Mary Anne Franks, president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, in a statement earlier this year. “But the Take It Down Act also includes a poison pill: an extremely broad takedown provision that will likely end up hurting victims more than it help.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation has similarly warned that the TDA is so broad that it gives the “powerful a dangerous new route to manipulate platforms into removing lawful speech that they simply don’t like”. Indeed, the president has said as much himself. “I’m going to use that bill for myself too if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody,” he told a joint session of Congress. All of which to say: Melania Trump may not be the best person to help manage AI’s growth responsibly and shield children from potential harm from the technology. But if she is keen on doing this work then I suggest she stop convening taskforces on how to integrate AI into childhood education, and simply ask her husband to stop gutting public education instead. The Trump administration is, for example, attempting to defund Head Start, a federally funded early childhood program for low-income families, and cancelled a grant program that has historically funded educational children’s programs like Sesame Street. The Trump administration is also trying to curtail education about slavery and Republicans are waging war on Wikipedia to try to remove criticism of Israel. More broadly, book bans and censorship are flourishing under Trump. Melania Trump is right that the robots are here, and they’re here to stay. But I’m not convinced that the Trump administration is going to responsibly integrate AI into our schools in a way that increases equity and the sum of human knowledge. Rather I think it’s more likely that all these AI taskforces will succeed in doing is diverting large sums of taxpayer money towards the tech CEOs who have been busy bowing to Trump. AI “will make a few people much richer and most people poorer”, Geoffrey Hinton, the so-called godfather of AI, told the Financial Times on Friday. Which, I suspect, is precisely why Melania Trump and the coterie of billionaires and tech executives gathered around her at the White House are so excited about it. Accused rapist Conor McGregor wants to be the next president of Ireland McGregor recently lost an appeal over a civil court ruling last year awarding damages to a woman who accused him of rape. He’s also had numerous other brushes with the law. Still that sort of thing doesn’t preclude someone from high office any more, does it? McGregor wants to be president of Ireland and Elon Musk is enthusiastically supporting him in that bid. A venture capitalist went to extreme lengths to punish her surrogate “Compared to natural conception, carrying a genetically unrelated foetus more than triples the risk of severe, potentially deadly conditions, a statistic surrogates are rarely given,” writes Emi Nietfeld for Wired in a harrowing feature about a venture capitalist, Cindy Bi, who viciously hounded her surrogate when the baby died in utero. Bi then had a healthy baby via another surrogate – who had an emergency hysterectomy in the process. It feels like for-profit surrogacy has been normalized by celebrities; this piece is an essential reminder of the ethical issues involved with the womb-for-hire industry. Epstein victims say they will compile their own ‘client list’ “We know the names,” one survivor said during a press conference on Wednesday. “Now, together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know were regularly in the Epstein world.” RFK Jr hints access to abortion pill could be cut back There is an enormous amount of evidence that shows mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly known as the abortion pills, are safe and effective. The health secretary, however, is claiming otherwise and suggested that access may be curtailed. Meanwhile, Texas just passed a bill banning abortion pills from being mailed to the state. Laura Loomer thinks Palestinian kids aren’t innocent The far-right Trump confidante and “proud Islamophobe” recently used her considerable influence to get the Trump administration to block medical visas for sick kids from Gaza. Now she’s justifying this by calling Palestinian kids terrorists. “You think these kids are so innocent?” Loomer said on her podcast. “[Y]ou think little kids are not capable of evil?” I think the real terrorists here may be the people who have created the world’s largest cohort of child amputees and are systematically starving babies to death.

"abortion","Abortion wasn’t on the Queensland election agenda. So why is it now a threat to the LNP campaign?","On front doorsteps in Brisbane’s middle suburbs, Liberal National party candidates campaigning for the upcoming Queensland election have started getting questions about abortion. “It’s becoming an issue … in places we thought we might win,” says one party member. Two weeks ago, as the Queensland election campaign began, Labor social media posts suggesting the LNP had a “secret plan” to limit abortion rights and access were dismissed as a scare campaign. The LNP leader, David Crisafulli, says his party has “ruled out” changes to Labor’s 2018 laws that decriminalised abortion. Abortion is, as Crisafulli says, “not a priority” for the LNP. But it has quickly become a problem. What might have started as a last-ditch Labor tactic has now become a mainstream issue, which LNP moderates say is damaging the party’s chances of regaining a footing in more progressive Brisbane electorates. This week the crossbench MP Robbie Katter pledged he would trigger a conscience vote to restrict – and possibly even criminalise – abortion. Crisafulli, whose ticket includes the former Christian right-backed senator Amanda Stoker and other MPs and candidates who are on record opposing abortion, has now been asked about the issue for five straight days. On Wednesday, he batted away 39 separate questions about the issue. Every question gets the same answer. The attempts to deflect are only adding fuel to the fire. ‘Divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away’ Soon after Crisafulli became LNP leader in 2020, he struck a sort of informal stability deal with his party room to put internal fights to one side to bolster the LNP’s chances of taking back government. At the 2020 election, the LNP’s internecine bickering contributed to a weak result. Party members referred to unpopular office bearers – who tried to roll the leader, Deb Frecklington, just weeks before the campaign – as “the cabal”. The party’s identity crisis was writ large in an email from the then president, Cynthia Hardy, who said a review of the 2020 loss would seek to define what the LNP stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?” Hardy asked members. The four-year rebuild has now put the LNP in a position where, according to the polls, it is on the verge of winning government in Queensland. Sources say key to the success has been the informal stability arrangement – MPs from the moderates, conservatives and the Christian right all agreeing to drop their personal crusades and focus on a singular goal. The party found a unifying purpose: beating Labor. “But those divisions are still there, they haven’t gone away” one LNP source says. The shift in the campaign to focus on abortion rights, and the prospect of a conscience vote, serves to highlight those divisions in a way that can cause significant damage to the party, just weeks before voters go to the polls. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The issue is so vexed for the LNP because it divides the party – the majority of its grassroots members, its platform and its MPs – from more progressive views of the electorate. Social reforms such as abortion and voluntary assisted dying have been key to Labor’s electoral success in Queensland, but particularly Brisbane where the LNP holds just four seats. Both of those reforms were progressed cautiously – drafted by the law reform commission and ultimately backed by polling that showed overwhelming support. And Labor has sought to exploit those sorts of social policy debates, knowing they harm the LNP in city areas where the party is eager to re-establish a presence. With the LNP cruising in the polls, moderates had held out hope of beating Labor in middle suburban seats – Ferny Grove, Stafford, Mansfield, Mount Ommaney and Aspley – areas beyond the reach of Greens insurgency, but still places where votes have more “small-l” liberal values. Many of these areas vote for the LNP at local and federal elections but are Labor strongholds in the state parliament. A Labor source says the reality is the state LNP is “way too wacko for Brisbane to stomach”. The added concern for LNP moderates is the potential makeup of the LNP party room after the election, if the party wins regional or city fringe seats but not Brisbane ones. “We need moderates in the next parliament,” one party member says. Prospect of a conscience vote Party sources say the “Christian soldiers” grouping within the LNP has relatively little influence within the current state parliamentary team. There are really only two hardcore members of the Christian right in the LNP party room – the retiring rightwinger Mark Robinson and the veteran Sunshine Coast MP Fiona Simpson. Others often attributed as being associated with the faction, such as Tim Mander or Christian Rowan, are more neatly aligned with Peter Dutton’s mainstream conservative grouping. But before elections, factions always battle for influence. Robinson is handing his seat to Stoker, the former federal senator and figurehead of the Christian right. Candidates who have won preselection for winnable LNP seats include several who have a history of opposing abortion rights, or with links to Pentecostal churches. Particularly concerning to LNP moderates is the recent takeover of a large inner-city party division – and the attempted takeover of another – by the Christian right. The party’s Griffith federal divisional council – covering Queensland’s most progressive federal seat – is now helmed by Alan Baker, a veteran of anti-abortion campaigns in the state. Baker sent a pre-election email on party letterhead saying the government had been “captured by transgender ideology”. “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence,” an LNP source said at the time Baker won control of the branch. With polls still pointing to a comfortable LNP win, the risk for Crisafulli is that the prospect of a conscience vote – brought about by Katter – serves to highlight internal conflicts that have been paused, rather than solved. The opposition leader won’t say publicly whether he would allow a conscience vote, in line with party convention. The federal MP Colin Boyce said it would be “extraordinary” not to. Crisafulli’s backers are mostly moderates, and MPs say the opposition has been “remarkably united” during the past term. But they also acknowledge that concern about abortion springs from “legitimate concern about what happens when we get in”. “It’s also difficult because we don’t have a track record to point back to,” the MP says. “We obviously try not to hark back to the Newman years.” In more than three decades, the conservatives have only won one Queensland election. After 2012, the landslide win by Campbell Newman, the LNP quickly became unstuck by factional warfare. The party’s MPs went to war with its organisational wing. The nature of the 2012 landslide also meant the election of new MPs who the party might not have expected to win. A state that voted for Newman, framed as a more moderate Liberal, wound up with a party room that veered more conservative and pushed that agenda in government. Griffith University political scientist and commentator Paul Williams says he expects those sorts of internal issues to come to the fore within 12 months of an LNP election win. “Those things are still there in the background,” he said. ‘Not part of the plan’ LNP figures predicted Labor attacks about abortion when Stoker – who lost her Senate seat in 2022 – was preselected to run in Oodgeroo. Stoker announced herself to the public with a firebrand speech on the Senate floor, describing Queensland’s abortion decriminalisation laws as “barbarism [with] the cloak of civility”. In 2022, she told the Conservative Political Action Conference the Coalition would be in opposition for a “very long time” if it did not focus on conservative social issues. But since being announced as a candidate, Stoker has been uncharacteristically quiet as the LNP attempts to stifle intensifying debate about abortion and other social issues, and instead focus on kitchen-table ones. Her appearances on Sky News and rightwing podcasts and anti-abortion rallies have all been replaced with community breakfasts and visits to small businesses. Asked on Thursday whether she would support changes to Labor’s 2018 abortion laws, Stoker used the party line: “It’s not part of our plan, the LNP has ruled it out.” The LNP’s continued refusal to engage beyond its rehearsed line – that abortion reform is “not part of our plan” – now risks backfiring amid ramping pressure from different sides of the debate. At a pre-election meeting of a conservative Christian group last month, attenders were urged to email, call or speak to candidates and “just ask them the question: how would you vote if abortion came up”. “The fact you say that puts it in their mind that abortion is an election issue,” the forum moderator said. The LNP has not responded to the Australian Christian Lobby’s pre-election survey, which includes questions about abortion. The pro-choice service Children by Choice also sent questions to every state MP asking whether they supported, and would protect, ongoing access to termination of pregnancy. None have responded. “It feels ominous, it’s a scary position,” says Jill McKay, the chief executive officer of Children by Choice. “It’s a very simple question. “We’re not trying to polarise who people vote for, but it is a very deep concern that one of our major political parties is unable to present to Queensland what their policies are. “Women who vote for the LNP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the ALP need to access abortion. Women who vote for the Greens need to access abortion.” LNP sources acknowledge that the Katter plan to bring the issue to the next parliament “fucks us”. “[Crisafulli] needs to come out and say something more definitive,” one party source says. But another warns that sticking to the agreed lines remains the only tactic that could keep the informal stability arrangement in place. “The discipline that this whole campaign has been built on would dissolve in a second,” the source says.","2024-10-12T19:00:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/13/queensland-election-2024-lnp-abortion-policy-david-crisafulli"
"abortion","Arizona senate passes repeal of 1864 near-total abortion ban","Arizona lawmakers have repealed the state’s 160-year-old statute banning nearly all abortions. The 1864 law, which was reinstated by the state supreme court three weeks ago, has made abortion a central focus in the battleground state and galvanized Democrats seeking to enshrine abortion rights. In the state senate, Democrats picked up the support of two Republicans in favor of repealing the ban. The Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, is expected to ratify the repeal, which narrowly cleared the Arizona house last week after three Republicans joined with all the Democrats in the chamber. Dozens of demonstrators for and against the right to abortion gathered at the capitol before the vote, and others packed into the chamber’s gallery to watch. As senators began to vote, Republicans in the chamber voiced bombastic protests and criticisms in floor speeches. Antony Kern, a Republican who has been indicted as a fake elector in a plot to undermine the 2020 election results, said his fellow Republicans backing the ban were the “epitome of delusion”. He claimed the vote would take the state down a slippery slope towards acceptance of pedophilia, as supporters cheered from the gallery with silent claps. Kern also compared the chamber repealing the bill to Nazi Germany. Another Republican senator, JD Mesnard, played a sonogram recording of his child’s heartbeat on the floor. He said: “These will be fewer, these heart beatings.” Republican Shawnna Bolick gave a 20-minute speech in defense of her vote to support the repeal, covering stories about her own pregnancies, other pregnancies, and her critiques of the state’s Democratic governor. Ultimately, she said, repealing the ban would allow Republicans to maintain a less extreme version of abortion restrictions. She said: “We should be pushing for the maximum protection for unborn children that can be sustained. I side with saving more babies’ lives.” The civil-war era statute, which predates Arizona’s statehood, bans nearly all abortions, including those sought by survivors of rape or incest. It also imposes prison terms for doctors and others who aid in abortions. The law had been blocked by the 1973 supreme court Roe v Wade decisions that granted the constitutional right to abortion. “We are relieved that lawmakers have finally repealed this inhumane abortion ban – something extremist politicians refused to do for far too long,” said Victoria López, director of program and strategy for the ACLU of Arizona. “Unfortunately, cruel abortion bans like the law from 1864 have been at the center of political stunts for years, causing lasting harm to people who need abortions and their providers.” Last month, the state’s Republican-appointed supreme court justices suggested it could be reinstated since Roe was overturned in 2022. The repeal would not take effect until June or July, 90 days after the legislative session. Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has vowed not to enforce the ban in the meantime. Providers, including Planned Parenthood, have been preparing resources to help patients seeking abortions to travel out of state during the time that the ban is in effect. “Today’s vote by the Arizona senate to repeal the draconian 1864 abortion ban is a win for freedom in our state,” Mayes said. Once the 1864 measure is stricken, a 2022 statue banning procedures after 15 weeks of pregnancy would supplant it as the state’s ruling abortion law. Abortion rights advocates have emphasized that repealing the ban is not enough. “This is an important step, but our work isn’t done,” said Ruben Gallego, a US congressman from Arizona who is running for the US Senate. “Arizona women deserve better. That’s why we’re going to pass a constitutional right to abortion and defeat anti-abortion extremists.” Democrats have been pushing for a ballot measure in November that would enshrine the right to abortions in the state’s constitution. In the weeks since the ban was reinstated , the Arizona for Abortion Access effort saw its volunteers grow from about 3,000 to more than 5,000. “Nothing has changed about the need for the Arizona abortion access act,” the group organizing the ballot measure said following the passage of the repeal. The issue has placed enormous pressure on the Arizona GOP, from conservatives who support the ban and from swing voters who oppose the extreme measure. On the senate floor on Wednesday, Bolick, as she cast her vote in favor of the repeal, said: “I want to protect our state constitution from unlimited abortions up until the moment of birth.” In the key swing state – one that historically leaned Republican but backed Joe Biden in 2020 – the issue could help turn out more voters who could help flip the statehouse blue. Republican lawmakers are considering putting one or more competing abortion proposals on the November ballot, including a 14-week ban and a “heartbeat protection act” that would make abortion illegal after six weeks. No such measures have been introduced yet.","2024-05-01T21:47:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/01/democrat-close-repeal-arizona-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Trump’s executive order on gender uses language pointing to ‘fetal personhood’","One of Donald Trump’s new executive orders, which claims there are only two genders, quietly incorporates tenets of fetal personhood – the legal doctrine, pushed by the anti-abortion movement, that life begins at conception and that embryos and fetuses therefore deserve full legal rights and protections. “‘Female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell,” reads the order, which was issued just hours after Trump took office on Monday. “‘Male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.” The words “at conception” have set off alarm bells among abortion rights supporters. If fully enacted, fetal personhood would have sweeping repercussions for all US law; not only would it outlaw abortion nationwide, but it could even lead governments to treat abortion as murder and treat people who undergo the procedure as murderers. “I don’t think it was a mistake. I don’t think it was a coincidence. I think this was an intentional way to continue to normalize the idea that embryos are people,” said Dana Sussman, senior vice-president of Pregnancy Justice, a reproductive justice group that tracks efforts to enshrine fetal personhood into law. “This is yet another attempt to codify it in one form or another.” During the campaign, Trump veered between taking credit for engineering the supreme court conservative majority that overturned Roe v Wade and claiming that he didn’t want to implement a national abortion ban. But the 2024 Republican platform evoked fetal personhood, stressing Republicans’ commitment to “the issue of life” and suggesting that fetuses are included in the 14th amendment’s guarantee that “no person can be denied life or liberty without due process”. Advocates of fetal personhood hope to ultimately bring a case to the supreme court that will lead the justices to declare that the 14th amendment applies from the moment of conception. (The 14th amendment also protects birthright citizenship, which Trump is now attempting to end.) Mary Ziegler, a University of California, Davis, School of Law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction, stressed that the executive order did not establish new protections or legal status for embryos and fetuses. “It’s unclear if this is Trump starting down a road towards much bolder steps on abortion or IVF or if this is just Trump throwing anti-abortion insiders a bone that most readers wouldn’t necessarily understand,” said Ziegler, who studies the legal history of reproduction. But, she added: “It’s always a big deal when you have something, a seed like that, planted in federal law that someone could maybe make something out of later.” In the weeks and days leading up to Trump’s return to the White House, abortion rights supporters feared that the new president would take steps to cut off access to the procedure, such as by using a 19th-century anti-vice law to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment or ordering the FDA to roll back its approval of a common abortion pill. So far, Trump has not yet taken decisive action on the issue. However, his administration did seemingly dispose of the website reproductiverights.gov, which included information about access to abortion pills and abortion coverage.","2025-01-23T12:29:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/trump-executive-order-fetal-personhood"
"abortion","First Thing: Federal agencies blaming Democrats for shutdown in possible breach of law","Good morning. An increasing number of federal agencies and staff are explicitly blaming Democrats for the government shutdown in possible violation of a law that bans federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity. The messages range in tone. Furloughed employees at some agencies have been told to schedule automated email messages that say they are not working because the Democrats caused a shutdown, while some agency websites have used more hostile language. For example, the treasury department’s website reads: “The radical left has chosen to shut down the United States government in the name of reckless spending and obstructionism.” The government shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a funding agreement before the Tuesday night deadline, with Democrats demanding a series of concessions related to healthcare, funding for public media and foreign aid that Republicans have refused. What is the law prohibiting partisan political activity? The 1939 Hatch Act restricts federal employees from engaging in political activities while on the job. The Maryland representative Jamie Raskin, a top Democrat and a constitutional lawyer, said messaging had been a “naked violation” of the law. Hamas to demand key revisions to Trump Gaza plan before accepting, sources say Hamas will demand key revisions to Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire proposal but is likely to accept the plan in the coming days as a basis for renewed negotiations, analysts and sources close to the group have suggested. Trump imposed a deadline of “three or four days” from Tuesday for Hamas to accept his 20-point plan, which aims to bring the two-year war in Gaza to a close and allow an apparently indefinite international administration of the devastated territory, or “pay in hell”. What are the sticking points? A key one is the demand that Hamas disarm, according to a source close to the organization, especially without substantial progress towards a two-state solution. US archivist ‘ousted’ after refusing to let Trump give Eisenhower’s sword to King Charles The Eisenhower Presidential Library’s director has left his post after allegedly resisting Donald Trump’s request to give King Charles a sword from the collection as a gift during the president’s recent state visit, according to reports on Thursday. Todd Arrington left his post on Monday after being told to “resign or be fired”, he told CBS News. It came after he allegedly pushed back on the request, which was meant to symbolise the US-UK relationship and the countries’ collaboration during the second world war. Did Trump give him the sword? No – he ended up giving the king a replica sword donated by West Point, the army academy where Eisenhower began his military career.

"abortion","Kim Kardashian is ready to squeeze your face","The Kardashians want to monetize your chin If you’ve got $48 and a burning desire to look like you’ve just had major jaw surgery, then you’re in luck! Kim Kardashian’s shapewear brand Skims has just come out with a contraption called the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap, which it describes as its “first-ever face innovation”. It’s essentially a piece of Velcro that goes around your face to provide what the marketing copy describes as “targeted compression for shaping &amp; sculpting” via “collagen yarn”. No, I don’t know what that means either. While I may be a tad unclear on how “collagen yarn” is supposed to work, I can tell you exactly how the Kardashian-Jenners operate: if there’s an insecurity that can be monetized, they’ll find a way to monetize it. Over the years the reality-TV-famous family have built an empire flogging everything from dubious detox teas to skincare products while posting heavily edited images that reinforce toxic beauty standards. The new face wrap appears to be an attempt to cash in on growing interest around what has been dubbed a “snatched jawline” – which is essentially a very chiselled jaw. A number of dubious products, including jaw massagers and “mastic chewing gum”, have popped up, promising to help you achieve this look. Now Skims has come out with its own exciting face innovation to get into the action. The medical-looking Face Wrap also seems to play into the way in which plastic surgery has become normalized. Celebrities used to be fairly hush-hush about going under the knife. Now they’re spilling all the details about which doctor they went to for their procedures and how much it cost. One surgeon told People magazine that the public is starting to see plastic surgery as just “another form of self-care”. While Skims’ new face wrap may scream “useless gimmick that promotes unhealthy beauty ideals”, it has already sold out and generated one unusual celebrity endorsement. In an Instagram video posted on Thursday Anthony Hopkins sported one of the Skims masks and jokingly slipped back into his Silence of the Lambs character, “the late, great Hannibal Lecter”, who wore a similar chinstrap in the film to curb his cannibalism. “Hello Kim, I’m already feeling 10 years younger,” Hopkins says. In a caption he added: “Don’t be afraid to come over for dinner.” Also chiming in on all the Skims chatter is Katie Piper, a model and TV presenter who was the victim of an acid attack in 2008 orchestrated by her ex-boyfriend. In a TikTok posted on Friday Piper said that the Kardashians’ “latest offering” reminded of her what she had to wear during her burn survivor recovery. “Please, people, don’t imprison your face in this contraption,” Piper says. “Don’t be so cruel and unkind to your face … to encase it in a stupid strap that, by the way, does absolutely nothing.” Amen to that. While it may be obvious, it’s worth reiterating that the Kardashians and other celebrities don’t look the way that they do because they strap medieval-looking torture devices around their faces while they sleep. Rather they shell out for expensive procedures like $100,000 deep plane facelifts and $500,000 facial rejuvenations. In 2023 Sharon Osbourne told the Telegraph that while she hadn’t kept a running total of how much she had spent on cosmetic surgery, “it must top more than a million.” You can buy whatever sort of body you desire these days – it’ll just cost you an arm and a leg. Anti-abortion Texas Republican accused of paying for abortions The Republican state representative Giovanni Capriglione played an instrumental part in ensuring Texas has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the US. Now a former adult entertainer called Alex Grace has claimed that she was romantically involved with Capriglione – who is married with kids – for almost two decades and he “funded several abortions for his own personal gain”. (There are some other extremely disgusting allegations involving cookie batter that I won’t repeat.) Capriglione has admitted to having an affair but says the rest of the story is lies. While I can’t confirm this particular case, there are plenty of other documented instances of anti-abortion extremists funding abortions for their mistresses.

"abortion","Largest Protestant US group condemns IVF in win for anti-abortion movement","The largest Protestant group in the US has condemned the use of in vitro fertilization, a move that is sure to inflame the already white-hot battle over IVF and reproductive rights in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe v Wade. On Wednesday, during the Southern Baptist Convention’s annual meeting, delegates voted in favor of a resolution that urges Southern Baptists “to reaffirm the unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage, and to only utilize reproductive technologies consistent with that affirmation”. The resolution in effect calls on the Southern Baptist Convention – a group that includes nearly 50,000 churches and almost 13 million members – to avoid IVF. The success of the resolution is a major victory for the anti-abortion movement, swathes of which have long opposed IVF on the grounds that providers create embryos that are not implanted in a woman’s uterus or are set aside after being screened for genetic anomalies. It also advances the tenets of “fetal personhood”, a movement to enshrine embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections that, if fully enacted, would rewrite vast swaths of US law. The Catholic church already officially opposes IVF, but the issue has not historically loomed as large among Protestants. Majorities of both white non-evangelical Protestants, white evangelical Protestants, and Black Protestants all support access to IVF. The Wednesday resolution suggests that this support may be in flux, since the Southern Baptist Convention has long been seen as a barometer of US evangelicalism and its future. IVF has been in the national spotlight since the Alabama state supreme court ruled earlier this year frozen embryos qualify as “extrauterine children”, a decision that led many IVF providers in the state to temporarily cease work. Although the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade cleared the way for attacks on IVF, many in the state and across the country were shocked by the ruling and its implications. This week, the US Senate is expected to vote on a bill that would codify a federal right to IVF. Although the bill is not expected to pass, Democrats in the Senate are hoping to get Republicans on the record opposing an infertility treatment that is widely popular. As part of the anti-IVF resolution, the Southern Baptist Convention called on its members to “promote” adoption. “Couples who experience the searing pain of infertility can turn to God, look to Scripture for numerous examples of infertility, and know that their lament is heard by the Lord, who offers compassion and grace to those deeply afflicted by such realities,” the resolution added.","2024-06-12T20:03:36Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/12/southern-baptist-convention-ivf-vote"
"abortion","Why the US is burning $10m worth of birth control","There are few better metaphors for the receding status of American women than one offered up by the Trump administration at a medical waste disposal facility outside Paris this week: rather than distribute nearly $10m worth of birth control, which had been purchased by USAID and was destined to be given to women in low-income countries, primarily in Africa, the Americans decided to burn it. The incinerated contraceptives included 900,000 birth control implants, 2m doses of injectable long-acting birth control, 2m packs of contraceptive pills and 50,000 IUDs. The medicine is just the latest in the far-reaching fallout from cuts made by the so-called “department of government efficiency,” or Doge, a project in which Elon Musk and a group of his very young, overwhelmingly male acolytes unilaterally slashed congressionally appropriated funding to government programs they did not like. The cuts have been devastating for non-profits that work to improve women’s health and safety worldwide. Sarah Shaw, an associate director at the global family planning group MSI Reproductive Choices, says that the cuts will put women at risk as they strain their health with unplanned pregnancies and seek out illegal abortions; other women who are denied access to birth control will lose out on the opportunities for education, professional development or remunerative work that can help them escape abuse, rise out of poverty, pursue their talents and ambitions and better provide for the children they already have. When MSI attempted to buy the contraceptives, the administration would only accept full price, which the organization couldn’t afford, she said. Several non-profits, including MSI, had offered to pay to ship and repackage the supplies, according to another representative. But the Trump administration refused, partially due to federal rules the prohibit the US from providing such goods to groups that perform, provide referrals for or offer education about abortions. In addition to the cost of purchasing the contraceptives, American taxpayers will now be on the hook for about $167,000 for the cost of burning them. It’s just the latest in a series of signs that the Trump administration is turning against the provision of birth control, particularly the safe, effective and woman-controlled hormonal methods that have been a cornerstone of healthcare policy for decades and which were a precondition of women’s advancement in work and education over the past 60 years. In April, the Trump administration abruptly announced that it was suspending a large swath of the domestic service grants distributed under Title X, the program meant to help low-income Americans access birth control, STD treatment and other sexual and reproductive healthcare. Of the 86 Title X grants awarded for fiscal year 2024, nearly 25% were “temporarily withheld”, mostly based on highly suspect allegations that the grant-receiving institutions – including 13 Planned Parenthood affiliates – had failed to comply with Trump executive orders banning things like DEI programs. Eight states now receive zero Title X dollars: California, Hawaii, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee and Utah. Alaska, Minnesota and Pennsylvania have also lost most of their contraception funding. The domestic cuts – along with the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from Medicaid reimbursements – mean that American women, too, are now facing dramatically greater obstacles to accessing birth control. Clinics that relied on Title X funding are now set to close: 11 Planned Parenthood clinics already have, including in Democratically controlled states like California. Planned Parenthood says that cumulatively, the cuts could lead the organization to close about 200 of its 600 clinics nationwide – a devastating cut to abortion providers in particular that will make a wide range of reproductive services inaccessible to women regardless of where they live. But the Trump administration is not merely forcing these programs for women’s health and dignity go up in flames. They are redirecting them to better suit their preferred cultural outcome: one in which women’s lives, ambitions and talents are all subordinated to the task of childbearing. The New York Times reported last month that the White House is redirecting Title X funds that once went to birth control to instead fund an “infertility training center” and programs in something called “restorative reproductive medicine”. If Title X’s original aim was to help American women control their fertility so as to build healthier families and to enable them to pursue other aims – like learning or work – in the new administration’s version, the program exists mainly to encourage women to have more children. But the switch should not be seen as a genuine investment in infertility, an often devastating condition with which many Americans struggle. Because the new Title X priorities do not, by and large, direct more money to IVF. Trump promised, on the campaign trail, to make IVF free. But the procedure, which has opponents on the Christian right, is not included in the administration’s new priority of “restorative” reproductive medicine, a practice that avoids controversial fertility treatments; instead, doctors seek the “root cause” of a woman’s infertility, which may involve telling them they can conceive with proper diet and exercise. In government, money allocation is a statement of values. With its dramatic cuts to contraceptive funding at home and abroad, the Trump administration is making its values clear. It does not value women’s health; it does not value their dignity, their control over their own lives, their aspirations, their earning potential, their desire to be freed from ignorance, or poverty, or the abuse they suffer under the hands of husbands and fathers. It does not value their ability to control their own bodies, and by extension, it does not value their ability to enter the public sphere. It does not value their dreams, their gifts, their hard work or invention or aspiration to anything other than making babies. American women, like women everywhere, depend on birth control to live lives of freedom and to pursue their dreams. But because of the Trump administration, those dreams are going up in smoke.

"abortion","Nevada activists secure signatures for vote on abortion access in November","Activists in Nevada, a key state in the upcoming US presidential elections, announced on Monday afternoon that they had turned in nearly double the number of signatures they need to get an abortion-related measure on the November ballot. Nevada currently allows abortions up until fetal viability, or the point at which an infant can survive outside the womb, which is generally pegged to around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Activists are hoping that, by enshrining the right to an abortion in the state constitution, abortion access will be protected from any legislative attempts to limit it. State officials still need to verify the signatures before confirming the measure will appear on the ballot. If the measure moves forward, Democrats are hoping that it will boost their candidates in the battleground state – particularly Joe Biden, who is currently trailing Donald Trump in Nevada polling. Ultimately, about a dozen states may vote on abortion rights come November, a prospect that could radically rewrite the map of US abortion access. Organizers in several states – including Arizona, another state that will be hotly contested in presidential election – are still collecting signatures for ballot measures, or have turned in signatures and are waiting for confirmation that their measure will advance to the ballot. At least one measure has already stumbled: in New York, a judge has knocked an abortion rights measure off the November ballot, ruling that state legislators who championed the measure failed to follow protocol. But in the last few weeks, officials and organizers in several states have announced that voters will get a direct say on abortion rights. Colorado On Friday, a Colorado state official confirmed that voters will get to decide whether to add abortion rights into the state’s constitution. A deep-blue state, Colorado already permits abortion after fetal viability. That’s later than most states – and has made Colorado a haven for both women who are fleeing abortion bans and women who are seeking abortions later on in pregnancy. Only a fraction of abortions occur after the first trimester of pregnancy. When women do get abortions past that point, they may be facing a medical emergency or learned of a fetal anomaly (many of which can only be detected later on in pregnancy). Abortion providers have also said that, since Roe fell, bans have delayed people’s ability to get abortions and thus pushed them later into pregnancy. Florida On 1 May, Florida outlawed abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, in effect demolishing the last stronghold of abortion access in the deep south. Now, Florida activists are hoping to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and restore providers’ ability to help abortion seekers fleeing southern abortion bans. To succeed, they will need 60% of the vote. That may be a tall order in an increasingly red state. Maryland Like Nevada and Colorado, Maryland already permits abortion. However, if voters pass a measure to enshrine the right to “reproductive freedom” – a potentially broad phrase – into the state constitution, abortion will be shielded the procedure from legislative attacks. South Dakota Abortion rights activists in South Dakota, which currently bans abortion, are hoping to revive the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Notably, they may face one of the greatest uphill battles out of any ballot measure campaign in the country. Abortion rights are generally popular and have only grown more so in the wake of Roe’s fall, but there are a handful of states where most residents do not support legalizing abortion. South Dakota is one of them, according to recent research from the Public Religion Research Institute. The measure proposed in South Dakota does not go as far as those of other states. Rather than protecting abortion access until fetal viability, its proposal would allow states to regulate it in the second trimester of pregnancy and prohibit it in the third.","2024-05-20T20:00:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/20/nevada-signatures-abortion-vote-november"
"abortion","Permanent contraception surged after Roe v Wade overturned, study finds","In the months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, permanent contraception in the form of tubal sterilizations and vasectomies surged among young adults living in states likely to ban abortion, new research released on Monday found. Compared to May 2022, when the opinion overturning Roe leaked, August 2022 saw 95% more vasectomies and 70% more tubal sterilizations performed on people between the ages of 19 and 26, according to the study, which was conducted by researchers at the George Washington University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. In addition to analyzing data about medical visits for permanent contraception before and after the opinion’s leak, the researchers also examined survey responses from more than 600 people between the ages of 14 and 24 who were asked about the fall of Roe. “It has made me want to be sterilized more,” said one 24-year-old female survey respondent from the US south. “The pill isn’t 100% effective and I’m afraid of losing access to it, and I do not want children in the future and would much rather be sterilized. I’m afraid of getting pregnant and not being able to make decisions for myself.” Published in the journal Health Affairs, the study also found that, overall, tubal sterilizations – which surgically alter women’s fallopian tubes and are colloquially known as “getting tubes tied” – were more popular than vasectomies. There were about seven more tubal sterilizations performed per state a month in the second half of 2022, compared to roughly three more vasectomies a month per state. That popularity probably reflects the longstanding expectation that women shoulder the burden of contraception. But Julia Strasser, the study’s lead author, suspects that there may be other reasons, too. “My guess is that it’s because people, who may be pursuing these methods because they fear that they will no longer have access to abortion services, may feel like they want to be the ones who are protecting their own sort of bodily autonomy versus relying on a partner,” said Strasser, who is also the director of the Jacobs Institute of Women’s Health at the George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. Tuesday’s study is the only latest piece of evidence indicating that more people sought permanent contraception in the wake of Roe’s collapse. Last year, another study also discovered that the rates of people under 30 who underwent tubal ligations and vasectomies increased after Roe fell. That study, however, did not break down its findings by state. To analyze patients’ interest in permanent contraception, Strasser and her co-authors relied on data from the health information company IQVIA, which broke down patient visits for permanent contraception in 2021 and 2022. Rather than examine states that enacted post-Roe abortion bans, the researchers split states into those that were thought likely to outlaw abortion versus those likely to protect it. Fear over a potential ban, they reasoned, could make someone want permanent contraception. The study may in fact be underestimating the post-Roe demand for permanent contraception among young adults, Strasser said, since it focused on individuals who actually underwent tubal sterilizations and vasectomies. Even when they are sure they do not want children, young people often struggle to find medical providers who will perform those services on them. “We don’t want them to be seeking them out of fear or concerns about their safety,” Strasser said. “But also, I think it’s important to recognize that young people, young adults, have autonomy over their contraceptive and reproductive health choices.”","2025-01-06T22:11:26Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/permanent-contraception-abortion-roe-v-wade"
"abortion","Trump administration to destroy nearly $10m of contraceptives for women overseas","The Trump administration has decided to destroy $9.7m worth of contraceptives rather than send them abroad to women in need. A state department spokesperson confirmed that the decision had been made – a move that will cost US taxpayers $167,000. The contraceptives are primarily long-acting, such as IUDs and birth control implants, and were almost certainly intended for women in Africa, according to two senior congressional aides, one of whom visited a warehouse in Belgium that housed the contraceptives. It is not clear to the aides whether the destruction has already been carried out, but said they had been told that it was set to occur by the end of July. “It is unacceptable that the State Department would move forward with the destruction of more than $9m in taxpayer-funded family planning commodities purchased to support women in crisis settings, including war zones and refugee camps,” Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic senator from New Hampshire, said in a statement. Shaheen and Brian Schatz, a Democratic senator from Hawaii, have introduced legislation to stop the destruction. “This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” added Shaheen, who in June sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, about the matter. The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that prohibit sending US aid to organizations that provide abortion services, counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas, according to the state department spokesperson. Most of the contraceptives have less than 70% of their shelf life left before they expire, the spokesperson said, and rebranding and selling the contraceptives could cost several million dollars. However, the aide who visited the warehouse said that the earliest expiration date they saw on the contraceptives was 2027, and that two-thirds of the contraceptives did not have any USAID labels that would need to be rebranded. The eradication of the contraceptives is part of the Trump administration’s months-long demolition of the Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for humanitarian and development aid in the world. After the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) erased 83% of USAID’s programs, Rubio announced in June that USAID’s entire international workforce would be abolished and its foreign assistance programs would be moved to the state department. The agency will be replaced by an organization called America First. In total, the funding cuts to USAID could lead to more than 14m additional deaths by 2030, according to a recent study published in the journal the Lancet. A third of those deaths could be children. “If you have an unintended pregnancy and you end up having to seek unsafe abortion, it’s quite likely that you will die,” said Sarah Shaw, the associate director of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, a global family planning organization that works in nearly 40 countries. “If you’re not given the means to space or limit your births, you’re putting your life at risk or your child’s life at risk.” MSI tried to purchase the contraceptives from the US government, Shaw said. But the government would only accept full price – which Shaw said the agency could not afford, given that MSI would also have to shoulder the expense of transportingthe contraceptives and the fact that they are inching closer to their expiration date, which could affect MSI’s ability to distribute them. The state department spokesperson did not specifically respond to a request for comment on Shaw’s allegation, but MSI does provide abortions as part of its global work, which may have led the department to rule it out as an “eligible buyer”. In an internal survey, MSI programs in 10 countries reported that, within the next month, they expect to be out of stock or be on the brink of being out of stock of at least one contraceptive method. The countries include Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Senegal, Kenya and Sierra Leone. Shaw expects the stock to be incinerated. “The fact that the contraceptives are going to be burned when there’s so much need – it’s just egregious,” she said. “It’s disgusting.” The Department of State spokesperson did not respond to a request for information on the planned method of destruction. The destruction of the contraceptives is, to Shaw, emblematic of the overall destruction of a system that once provided worldwide help to women and families. USAID funding is threaded through so much of the global supply chain of family planning aid that, without its money, the chain has come apart. In Mali, Shaw said, USAID helped pay for the gas used by the vehicles that transport contraceptives from a warehouse. Without the gas money, the vehicles were stuck – and so were the contraceptives. “I’ve worked in this sector for over 20 years and I’ve never seen anything on this scale,” Shaw said. “The speed at which they’ve managed to dismantle excellent work and really great progress – I mean, it’s just vanished in weeks.” Other kinds of assistance are also reportedly being wasted. This week, the Atlantic reported that almost 500 metric tons of emergency food were expiring and would be incinerated, rather than being used to feed about 1.5 million children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, almost 800,000 Mpox vaccines that were supposed to be sent to Africa are now unusable because they are too close to their expiration date, according to Politico. The cuts to foreign aid are slated to deepen. Early on Friday morning, Congress passed a bill to claw back roughly $8bn that had been earmarked for foreign assistance. “It’s not just about an empty shelf,” Shaw said. “It’s about unfulfilled potential. It’s about a girl having to drop out of school. It’s about someone having to seek an unsafe abortion and risking their lives. That’s what it’s really about.”","2025-07-18T18:01:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-administration-destroy-contraceptives-usaid-africa"
"abortion","British abortion law is a medieval nightmare","When it emerged last year that six women had been prosecuted in Great Britain for procuring abortions, that was a little more than a blip: it was twice as many women, in a single year, as had been taken to court in the previous 160 years combined. Behind those cases, of course, there’s an unknown number of women who were investigated but cleared, so their phones were seized, they were prevented from contact with their children, they were questioned under caution with the possibility of life imprisonment when they’d just had a miscarriage. All these women lived, if not their worst, then surely their most medieval, nightmare, and some are living it as we speak. The natural question was: what the hell was going on? Had the police lost their minds? (When the Guardian asked one force about its actions last year, it chose to lie about them, which surprised me.) Was the director of public prosecutions anti-abortion? (Max Hill KC declined to comment.) Had medics suffered some kind of group amnesia around patient confidentiality? (The police generally become involved only when they’re alerted by a doctor or midwife.) All that is still possible, but when I spoke to the campaign organisation Doctors for Choice, it exhibited the kind of pragmatism you look for in a doctor. Never mind the finger-pointing – change the law. Abortion should not be in the criminal code at all. Life imprisonment is the harshest penalty for illegal abortion in the world, which gives England and Wales the dubious distinction of being more severe than Syria, Poland, Texas and South Sudan. Doctors, midwives, nurses and students are launching a campaign this week – a protest outside the Old Bailey, posters on buses – in support of an amendment to the criminal justice bill that will come to a vote at the end of the month. And again, you’ve got to hand it to medics for driving this: between their pay degradation, the student debt overhang, the bizarre hostility from government ministers and the crazy hours, you’d think they’d have enough on their plate. Abortion law in much of the UK is an arcane fix left over from 1967, which you maybe don’t think seriously about until you’re seeking an abortion. Given that one in three British women will at some point, that’s quite a lot of people who’ve been in this objectively comical position: you have to get two doctors to sign off on the fact that the pregnancy represents a grave, permanent threat to your mental health. Theoretically, you have to pretend to be crazy, and they have to pretend to believe you, in order to enact what will plausibly, besides dropping geography at GCSE, be the sanest decision of your life. I remember being genuinely unclear about what this situation would require: would a simple “yes” to the imperilled mental health question suffice, or would I also need to rend my garments and make nervous breakdown noises? Just a “yes” was fine, but plainly the law was infantilising, removing my agency and delivering it to two doctors who didn’t want it. Equally plainly, who cared? It was the late 20th century, when all arcs tended to justice and legal anomalies were just boring parliamentary debates that hadn’t been had yet. The magnificent gynaecologist and campaigner Wendy Savage used to sometimes tell us on panels to wise up and fight a bit harder. But by and large, we stayed pretty polite about it. And now it’s 30 years later, and she’s 88, and she’ll be speaking on this week’s protest, and – without wishing to put words in her mouth – I imagine she’ll be saying a more elegant version of, “Holy shit, you lot – the arc is all over the place, and now you really need to wise up and fight a bit harder.” Don’t wait to find out who’s driving these prosecutions; don’t wait until the first conviction is landed using period tracker data; don’t wait to see whether the US, in rolling back reproductive rights, was an outlier or a harbinger: fight for decriminalisation now, because staying polite has got us precisely nowhere.

"abortion","A Trump-Vance administration would be ‘the most dangerous’ for abortion rights, say advocates","Within minutes of Donald Trump’s announcement that he had tapped Ohio senator JD Vance as his running mate in the 2024 elections, abortion rights groups vociferously condemned the pick. “A Trump-Vance administration will be the most dangerous administration for abortion and reproductive freedom in this country’s history,” Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. “By naming Vance to his ticket, Trump made clear that his administration will sign a national abortion ban and put birth control and IVF at risk,” said Jessica Mackler, president of Emily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic women who support abortion rights running for office. Vance, the venture capitalist turned Hillbilly Elegy author turned GOP standard-bearer, has long opposed abortion. In 2021, while running for Ohio senate, Vance told an Ohio news outlet that he did not support rape and incest exceptions in abortion bans. “It’s not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term,” he said. “It’s whether a child should be allowed to live, even though the circumstances of that child’s birth are somehow inconvenient or a problem to the society.” But voters’ outrage over the overturning of Roe v Wade has grown, leading abortion rights supporters to a string of victories at the ballot box, and harnessing that outrage is widely considered Democrats’ best hope for winning the November elections. As Trump and other Republicans have tried to project a moderated stance on the issue – despite the fact that Trump handpicked three of the supreme court justices who overturned Roe – Vance has also tempered his public position. “We have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans. They just don’t,” Vance told CNN’s Jake Tapper last year. “I say this as a person who wants to protect as many unborn babies as possible. We have to provide exceptions for the life of the mother and rape and so forth.” In 2022, Vance said he would support a national 15-week abortion ban with exceptions. He also told NBC News that he wants mifepristone, a common abortion pill that was at the heart of a major supreme court case this year, to remain accessible. Even while supporting a national ban, Vance has said he would like abortion to be “primarily a state issue”. “Ohio is going to want to have a different abortion policy from California, from New York, and I think that’s reasonable,” he said. “I want Ohio to be able to make its own decisions, and I want Ohio’s elected legislators to make those decisions.” But, he added: “I think it’s fine to sort of set some minimum national standard.” Much of Vance’s public persona, however, remains defined by his support of what he sees as the traditional nuclear family. He has backed policies that he says will increase birth rates, such as making childbirth free, and said that people who are childfree by choice “do not have any physical commitment to the future of this country”. “I think the rejection of the American family is perhaps the most pernicious and the most evil thing that the left has done in this country,” said Vance, a father of three. He then went on to suggest that several Democratic politicians, like Kamala Harris and New Jersey senator Cory Booker, should not have political power because they do not have children. “Why have we let the Democrat party become controlled by people who don’t have any children? And why is this just a normal fact of American life?” Vance asked. “That the leaders of our country should be people who don’t have a personal and direct stake in it via their own offspring, via their own children?” (The vice-president has two stepchildren.) “Many of the most unhappy and most miserable and most angry people in our media are childless adults,” he continued. Vance has also called people who fear having kids “cat ladies” who “must be stopped” and said that universal daycare is “class war against normal people”. Two days after the US supreme court overturned Roe, Vance tweeted: “If your worldview tells you that it’s bad for women to become mothers but liberating for them to work 90 hours a week in a cubicle at the New York Times or Goldman Sachs, you’ve been had.” Shortly after Trump announced he had chosen Vance as his running mate, Joe Biden’s campaign started to circulate a clip of comments Vance made in 2021 about violence in marriages. “This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is the idea that, like: ‘Well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally, you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses like they change their underwear, that’s going to make people happier in the long term,’” Vance said in response to a question on fatherlessness. Vance has said that he was not defending men who commit domestic abuse and that he himself is a victim of domestic abuse. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the powerful anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, praised Vance on Monday. “His ability to compellingly share these stories on a national stage will surely be an asset,” Dannenfelser said in a statement. “With approximately 750,000 babies in states like California and New York still lacking basic protections, we need champions whose boldness will not waver.”","2024-07-16T10:00:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/16/jd-vance-abortion-rights-groups"
"abortion","At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics shutter amid political turbulence","At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics across seven states have shuttered since the start of 2025 or have announced plans to close soon – closures that come amid immense financial and political turbulence for the reproductive health giant as the United States continues to grapple with the fallout from the end of Roe v Wade. The Planned Parenthood network, which operates nearly 600 clinics through a web of independent regional affiliates and is overseen by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, is facing a number of threats from the Trump administration. A Guardian analysis has found that Planned Parenthood closures have occurred or are in the works across six affiliates that maintain clinics in Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Utah and Vermont. In late March, the Trump administration suddenly froze tens of millions of dollars in funding for nine Planned Parenthood affiliates, including at least two that have since closed clinics or are set to do so soon. The funding, which flowed from the federal family planning program Title X, was used to provide services such as contraception, cancer screenings and STI tests. “The ways in which this administration is dismantling access to public health and public health information are really troubling and, frankly, force us to make these difficult decisions very quickly,” said Shireen Ghorbani, interim president of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, which saw $2.8m of its Title X funding – 20% of the affiliate’s budget – frozen under the Trump administration. It has since closed two clinics as well as laid off a number of staffers who worked on initiatives like sex education. Last year, Ghorbani said, 26,000 Utahns received Title X-funded care at Planned Parenthood. Ghorbani does not believe that Utah’s Republican-controlled state legislature will step in to create a substitute program. “I will be shocked if a single cent is spent to make sure that people are able to control their health and their sexual and reproductive lives,” she said. Planned Parenthood’s financial woes have raised eyebrows for some advocates of abortion rights and reproductive health. The organization has weathered several crises, including allegations of mismanagement, in the years since Roe collapsed – but as the face of US abortion access it continued to rake in donations. (Most abortions in the US are in fact performed by small “independent” clinics, which are grappling with their own financial turmoil.) As of June 2023, the Planned Parenthood network had about $3bn in assets, according to its 2024 report. In April, Planned Parenthood of Michigan’s announced that it would cut its staffing by 10% and close four clinics. Viktoria Koskenoja, an emergency medicine doctor who worked at one of the clinics that has closed, said that the closures came as “a real shock”. “It’s sort of a frantic scramble right now to figure out where these patients are going to be able to go,” said Koskenoja, who lives in Michigan’s rural Upper Peninsula. “People are just going to get worse care for the time being, until we can figure something out.” She added: “I think that if they had asked for money from the community to keep it open, people would have donated.” In a press release, Planned Parenthood of Michigan attributed the closures and layoffs to “historic threats and cuts to federal funding”. The cuts to Title X, it said, “deal a devastating financial blow to healthcare providers like PPMI”. But Planned Parenthood of Michigan was not among the Planned Parenthood affiliates that saw their Title X funding frozen. In Michigan, the federal government distributes Title X funding to the state’s department of health and human services, which in turn doles money out to clinics, including those run by Planned Parenthood of Michigan. The Michigan department of health and human services has not seen a disruption in Title X funding. Planned Parenthood of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the clinic closures and the role of Title X in those closures. The squeeze the organization is navigating may be about to tighten. Republicans at the national level are ramping up their campaign to “defund” Planned Parenthood by kicking it out of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income people. Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood nationwide each year, nearly half rely on Medicaid. Additionally, the supreme court is weighing a case involving an attempt by South Carolina to remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program over the organization’s status as an abortion provider. If the high court greenlights South Carolina’s move, it could pave the way for other red states to refuse to reimburse Planned Parenthood for Medicaid costs. In Congress, Republicans’ “one big beautiful” tax bill, which has passed the House of Representatives and is now being considered in the Senate, also includes a provision that would effectively bar organizations that offer abortions from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for other reproductive health services. The provision is so narrowly tailored – it only applies to organizations that received more than $1m in Medicaid reimbursements – that it would only affect Planned Parenthood. “Plain and simple, this reconciliation bill is about attacking Planned Parenthood,” Alexis McGill Johnson, CEO and president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. If the tax bill passes as is, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York would lose about $20m and be forced to close clinics, according to Wendy Stark, the affiliate’s CEO and president. “Here we are, a few years post-Dobbs, and you’re seeing health providers in [abortion] access states really struggle financially,” Stark said, referring to Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health, the supreme court decision that overturned Roe. “That’s not an accident, right? What’s going on currently with the administration has been layered on top of existing threats and challenges.” Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is currently looking to sell its only Manhattan clinic. Medicaid and private insurance reimbursement rates, Stark said, were already too low, especially as the costs of medical supplies, insurance and rent have all risen in the years since the Covid pandemic. Last year, it cost the affiliate about $67m to provide healthcare services, but it only received about $36m in insurance reimbursements, she added. It shuttered four clinics in 2024.","2025-06-02T14:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/02/at-least-20-planned-parenthood-clinics-shutter-amid-political-turbulence"
"abortion","Ketanji Brown Jackson pens fiery dissent in abortion ruling: ‘Facilitating suffering of people’","In a searing dissent Thursday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson slammed her fellow justices’ decision to dismiss the case over whether a state can ban abortions to protect women’s health, pointing out that the dismissal will drag out the case – and potentially endanger Americans. “Will this court just have a do-over, rehearing and rehashing the same arguments we are considering now, just at a comparatively more convenient point in time?” Jackson asked in a dissent read from the bench, a move justices tend to only make when they feel particularly fired up. “Or maybe we will keep punting on this issue altogether, allowing chaos to reign wherever lower courts enable states to flagrantly undercut federal law, facilitating the suffering of people in need of urgent medical treatment.” The case deals with whether Idaho’s abortion ban, which only permits abortions in cases where a woman’s life is in danger, violates a federal law known as Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (Emtala). That law, which dates back the 1980s, requires hospitals that receive federal dollars – which is virtually all of them – to stabilize the health of patients who show up at their emergency rooms in the midst of medical emergencies. The Biden administration had sued Idaho, arguing that its abortion ban forced doctors to break federal law by leading them to withhold abortions until women were on the verge of death. The supreme court initially issued an order allowing Idaho’s abortion ban to take full effect but, in its Thursday dismissal of the case as “improvidently granted” – indicating they should have never taken it on – the justices agreed to let Idaho doctors resume performing emergency abortions. “We cannot simply wind back the clock to how things were before the court injected itself into this matter. Our intervention has already distorted this litigation process,” Jackson said in her dissent. “We permitted Idaho’s law to go into effect by staying the district court’s injunction in the first place, then allowed this matter to sit on our merits docket for five months while we considered the question presented.” Letting the Idaho case continue to play out will also impact the rest of the US, Jackson added. Although many states that ban abortion permit the procedure to protect women’s health, a handful do have bans on the books that, like Idaho, only allow abortions to save a patient’s “life”. These bans could conflict with Emtala, according to briefing in the supreme court case by the Biden administration. Notably, Texas has also already sued the Biden administration over Emtala. The state’s claim in that suit was that the landmark law protecting emergency abortion access was “an attempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic”. Courts have since sided with Texas, blocking Biden administration guidance about Emtala and emergency abortions from taking effect in Texas. The dismissal in the Idaho case does not impact the Texas litigation. The Texas Emtala case could land in front of the supreme court as early as next term, Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, told reporters in a call on Thursday. A final decision in the case may not arrive until after the November elections. If Donald Trump wins the presidency, his administration could decide to shift its priorities, change the executive branch’s interpretation of Emtala and stop litigating the case, according to Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health. If that happens, Idaho’s abortion ban may end up remaining as is. “As someone who cares about access to care, this decision is just a temporary reprieve,” Huberfeld said. “It’s not the end of the line.” Jackson effectively sided with the 6-3 vote to dismiss the case, in that she agreed with the move to let emergency abortions resume in Idaho but said she would not have dismissed it as improvidently granted. To the extent that Emtala is in conflict with Idaho’s ban, she wrote, the federal law trumps state law. “This months-long catastrophe was completely unnecessary,” Jackson said. She continued: “This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation and we have squandered it. And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas and elsewhere will be paying the price.”","2024-06-27T20:59:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/27/ketanji-brown-jackson-dissent-idaho-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Australian abortion provider says new Google policy will make it harder to advertise services","The Australian abortion and contraception provider MSI says Google is forcing the organisation to pay thousands of dollars a year to a third-party US company to keep advertising its telehealth services in Google search. Under a new health and medicines policy introduced by Google in May, providers offering telemedicine services globally must be certified and comply with local laws. From August providers in Australia will be required to register with the Portland, Oregon-based certifications provider LegitScript to keep advertising their services. MSI said it would cost more than $4,700 in registration and annual fees but the price may vary. These fees are separate to the costs of advertising the services. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The organisation has argued that forcing healthcare providers into expensive third-party verification with a US-based company ignores the regulations and inspections under Australian state and federal governments that MSI is subject to. It argued this puts an extra hurdle up in getting advertisements online. The managing director of MSI Australia, Greg Johnson, said access to abortion and contraception services would be threatened if MSI could not advertise telehealth services, particularly to those based in regional areas. “We already have extensive consumer protections in place through Australian regulatory bodies and quality assurance programs,” he said. “Google’s new policy just adds an expensive, opaque layer of red tape and will ultimately cause harm to people who need care.” MSI’s director of clinical excellence, Dr Catriona Melville, said it was concerned the US-based company was making decisions influenced by the US political climate surrounding reproductive rights. “We believe that Australian healthcare policy should be determined by Australians, not by the political landscape of another country.” A spokesperson for Google said the policy covered all telemedicine ads and was not specific to abortion providers. “This helps ensure that people can safely access these services, while complying with relevant laws and industry standards,” the spokesperson said. “Many telemedicine providers in Australia and around the world have completed this certification process and are successfully running ads on our platforms.” The spokesperson said LegitScript was a globally recognised accreditation body used by companies around the world, and Google relied on LegitScript’s expertise to ensure user safety and advertiser compliance. There were no exceptions to the policy, the spokesperson said, but added Google was working with MSI to clarify the policy and requirements. LegitScript’s senior communications manager, David Khalaf, said the company’s goal is to make the internet safer and more transparent by protecting consumers from the online sale of fraud and violative products. “By partnering with companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and TikTok, our Healthcare Merchant Certification program ensures that pharmacies and telemedicine companies advertising on these platforms have demonstrated compliance and are operating within all laws and regulations of their applicable jurisdiction,” he said. MSI has previously experienced issues with advertising its services in Australia through Google in 2019 and 2022 over the wording of abortion services. MSI Ghana also reported in March that its use of the term “pregnancy options” had fallen afoul of Google’s ad policy in the country. Google denied this, arguing that the ads may have been rejected for targeting people based on sensitive health categories such as pregnancy.","2024-07-19T02:28:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/19/australian-abortion-provider-says-new-google-policy-will-make-it-harder-to-advertise-services"
"abortion","How one expert nurse with a pink trailer is bringing vital healthcare to women in regional Victoria","The idea of travelling to Victoria’s most remote corners, hopping between small towns every few weeks and living out of a suitcase doesn’t sound like everyone’s dream job. But when Louise Holland heard about the opportunity to run a mobile women’s health clinic that involved just that, she jumped at it. For the past month, the nurse practitioner has been travelling on board a hot-pink coloured trailer fitted out as a medical clinic on wheels, named Nina. “You sure can’t miss it,” she says. “Especially when we’re parked right next to the local footy club.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Inside, there’s a small reception area, an X-ray room for breast screenings and a compact office where she offers free, 45-minute appointments. Services include cervical screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, prescriptions for long-acting, reversible contraception and referrals for mental health or alcohol and other drug support. Holland also provides prescriptions for medical abortions – a drug-induced termination that can be carried out up to nine weeks gestation – and offers referrals for surgical abortions. She says that while Victoria is the “nation-leader” in abortion access, it can still be challenging for women, particularly in remote and regional areas, to receive timely care. “There are some well-serviced towns with GPs who would provide abortion services to their client base – but some don’t take on new clients, even in these circumstances,” Holland says. “Then there’s others who don’t provide the services at all and then there’s towns without GPs. I usually work in Bendigo and we have women who call us from two to three hours away, from Deniliquin across the NSW border, trying to access abortion services.” Her account is backed up by data. A report by the not-for-profit Women’s Health Victoria, published last year, found seven out of 10 Victorian local government areas had no surgical abortion provider and one in five had no medical abortion provider in 2023. Meanwhile, 17% of Victorian GPs provided access to medical abortions and less than 20% of pharmacies in the state dispensed the drugs for medical abortions. “This is why the van is just so brilliant,” Holland says. “People can come and see me, I can tell them what their options are. “For some women, who track their cycles on apps and know that they are in the very early stages of pregnancy, they can come in and say, ‘I don’t want to wait until I’m six weeks to have an ultrasound’ and I can provide medication.” For others, she says, it might require a follow-up visit or a referral to another service: “Everyone’s story is different and individualised and you need to be very mindful of that. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach.” The areas the van will visit have been chosen based on demographics and demand. So far, Holland has visited Edenhope, a remote town in western Victoria about four-and-a-half hours from Melbourne, as well as Daylesford and Bendigo, where she is working alongside the local Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation. Holland has focused on building relationships in each place she visits. This includes working with schools, where she has offered sexual education classes for senior students, and meeting with pharmacists to discuss access to emergency contraception and medical abortion drugs. “I’ll ask the pharmacist questions like, ‘Would you give emergency contraception to a 15-year-old if they walked in and asked for the morning-after pill?’ Because in my experience, that’s not happening,” Holland says. “And of course, I’ll ask about medical abortion medications – if they dispense MS-2 Step. If they say yes, then that’s great. I give them my provider number, tell them to get in touch if there’s any issues while I’m in town. Or, if they don’t, then I need to look elsewhere.” In Edenhope, Holland met with Jo Grant, the primary health coordinator at Grampians Health, to ask for a private clinical space to conduct pelvic examinations. Grant agreed – and booked in to see Holland herself. She says the town has one male GP, who is generally booked out weeks in advance, with the closest female doctor 45 minutes away at a clinic in Naracoorte, in South Australia. “Visiting the doctor is the sort of thing you put off if you’re a woman living in the area, because you probably are going to have to drive, and you’ve got to fit it around school pickup, kinder drop offs, or whether you’re shearing or whatever is going on in your life,” Grant says. “Women’s roles are very complex, and they often do put their health needs on the back burner.” The mobile clinic is a joint project between the Victorian government and BreastScreen Victoria, which has been conducting mobile breast checks for years. It forms part of the state’s $153m women’s health package, which also includes funding for 20 new women’s health clinics, a dedicated Aboriginal women’s health clinic, a virtual women’s health clinic and the doubling of the number of laparoscopies for endometriosis and related conditions. The health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, said the package – and other initiatives such as an inquiry into women’s pain – came from meetings of Labor’s female MPs. “I have no doubt whatsoever that the massive increase in representation in our party has changed what we prioritise and focus on,” Thomas said. “We bring to the parliament our own lived experience of being dismissed, being told that the pain that we’re experiencing is not real, not being able to access the services that we need.” She said she was working to improve abortion access in Victoria and that the US supreme court overturning Roe v Wade should serve as a reminder of the need for vigilance in Australia, especially as “far-right politicians aligned with conservative groups” continue to stir up the debate. Nina will travel to St Arnaud (17-28 March), Birchip (31 March-11 April), Warracknabeal (14 April-2 May), and Nhill (5-15 May).","2025-03-08T01:00:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/08/how-one-expert-nurse-with-a-pink-trailer-is-bringing-vital-healthcare-to-women-in-regional-victoria"
"abortion","Republicans divided over Arizona near-total abortion ban, poll shows","Republicans are nearly evenly divided over the Arizona supreme court’s decision to uphold an 1864 law that would ban almost all abortions, new polling shows. Forty-nine per cent of Republicans strongly or somewhat disapprove of the decision, while 46% of Republicans strongly or somewhat approve of it, according to polling of more than 1,000 likely voters released on Tuesday by the left-leaning thinktank Data for Progress. That split reflects the GOP’s identity crisis over post-Roe v Wade abortion politics, as Republican politicians have struggled to talk about an issue that was once their bread-and-butter but has become increasingly toxic for them. Data for Progress found that voters diverged along party lines on whether they believed Donald Trump’s statements on the issue. Trump has said that the Arizona supreme court went too far while insisting that the decision will be “straightened out”. He has also continued to say that abortion remains an issue best decided by state governments, a position he took in a video issued just a day before the Arizona supreme court ruling. In the group’s polling, more than 80% of Democrats said that they believed Trump was being “dishonest” and would sign national restrictions on abortion. About the same percentage of Republicans said that Trump was being “honest” and would not restrict abortion further. Independents were more split. Forty-four per cent of independent and third-party voters said that they thought Trump was being honest, but 41% per cent of those voters believed that Trump was being dishonest. Forty-one per cent of independent and third-party voters also believed that Trump would restrict abortion access if elected president, while 30% thought he would keep abortion access roughly the same. Only a quarter of Republicans thought Trump would restrict abortion access; about half thought he would leave abortion access alone. Just 12% thought he would tighten abortion restrictions, with the rest of the Republican voters in the poll saying that they did not know. Ultimately, though, most voters thought that the president of the United States has relatively little to do with abortion rights. Republicans, independent voters and third-party voters, in particular, think members of Congress, statewide officials and state lawmakers all have more to do with setting abortion policy. Before the US supreme court overturned Roein 2022, the GOP embraced abortion bans and passed scores of restrictions that, now that Roe has fallen, have been able to take full effect and cut off access to the procedure for millions of women. But most Americans believe abortion should at least be available in the first trimester of pregnancy and, powered by outrage over Roe’s demise, abortion-rights supporters have won multiple red-state ballot measures to protect abortion rights. Some Republican officials and candidates have since attempted to moderate their stance on abortion; multiple Arizona Republicans with a history of anti-abortion beliefs denounced the Arizona supreme court decision. However, Republicans in the state legislature also blocked an effort to repeal the 1864 abortion ban, which would only permit abortions in cases where the pregnant person’s life was in danger and does not have exceptions for rape or incest.","2024-04-16T09:00:37Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/16/republicans-divided-arizona-abortion-ban"
"abortion","‘We can’t just vote’: protesters gather in Chicago for Gaza and abortion rights before Democratic convention","As thousands of Democratic delegates, party officials and elected leaders descend on Chicago for the Democratic national convention a smaller, strident group of protesters have taken to Michigan Avenue ahead of a week that promises several demonstrations. A protest of up to 1,000 marchers combining support for the Palestinian cause and abortion rights gathered at the corner of Wacker Drive and Michigan Avenue in Chicago Sunday evening. The protest is the first of several demonstrations, legally permitted and not, planned for the convention. Some protesters at the march, organized by groups like Bodies Against Unjust Laws, have come explicitly to “Disrupt the DNC”, arguing that American support for Israel in the Gaza war was tantamount to genocide and that the Democratic party was indistinguishable from Republicans and equally unworthy of political support. “The rhetoric that comes out of the mouths of politicians – and I’m not saying that some of it isn’t sincere in the wish to defend reproductive justice, or for trans and queer people, or even for citizens on the ground in Gaza – but rhetoric does not stop the bombs from falling,” says Linda Loew, a protest leader. “Rhetoric does not deliver abortion care from someone in a state that has a six-week abortion ban. What we need is action. We need the end to funding to Israel and the end of delivery of weapons.” It didn’t matter to some of these protesters if the nominee was Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. “There’s no indication that there is much of a difference at this point,” said Megan Behrent, a college professor in New York, about Biden and Harris, adding that she would vote third party. “I just kind of expect that in the lead-up to this kind of election, the kind of focus on the lesser evil always starts dominating politics,” she says. “And for good reason. Trump is, you know, a nightmare. But for me, the most important thing is to maintain an independent kind of organizing voice, to continue to raise the issues that matter.” Andy Thayer, a notable Chicago activist, speaking for Bodies Outside of Unjust Laws and the Coalition for Reproductive Justice, says: “We applied for the permit on the first legal day we could, January 2, and the city delayed us for the next eight-plus months.” Ronnie Mosley, a Chicago city alderman, was walking along the outskirts of the protest with police officers. He described this protest as an act of free speech, and something the city can handle. Meanwhile, protesters interspersed calls to free Palestine with “Intifada, intifada”, which translates to uprising or rebellion. Intifada was also the name given to a series of deadly outbreaks of violence in Israel and the occupied territories in the 1980s and 2000s. “I think the audience [for the protest] is the entire population of American people. I think that those who want to vote in the election should absolutely vote. We fought hard for that right, and we do not want to see that taken away,” Loew said. “But we can’t just vote. We have never been able to rely on a single politician of either party to deliver our rights, whether it’s been civil rights or removal of US forces from unpopular wars or the right to get an abortion in this country.”","2024-08-19T01:53:38Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/19/chicacgo-dnc-protests-gaza-wacker-drive-michigan-avenue"
"abortion","Baby of brain-dead Georgia woman on life support delivered via C-section","A brain-dead Georgia woman who was kept on life support to continue her pregnancy had her baby late last week, according to the woman’s mother. The Georgia woman, Adriana Smith, gave birth prematurely via emergency cesarean section on 13 June, Smith’s mother, April Newkirk, told the local news station 11Alive, which first reported Smith’s story. The baby, named Chance, is in the neonatal intensive care unit and weighs 1lb 13oz, 11Alive reported late on Monday night. “He’s expected to be OK,” Newkirk said. “He’s just fighting. We just want prayers for him. Just keep praying for him. He’s here now.” Smith is set to be taken off of life support on Tuesday, Newkirk added. Smith went to a hospital in February with what she thought was an intense headache, Newkirk told 11Alive earlier this year. The hospital discharged Smith after providing her with medication, but she was rushed back to the hospital the following day after she woke up gasping for air. Diagnosed with blood clots in her brain, Smith was declared brain dead within hours. Smith’s case sparked nationwide outrage after her family said doctors informed them that Georgia’s six-week abortion ban required Smith be kept on life support to preserve her pregnancy. Georgia’s ban contains provisions that strengthen the concept of “fetal personhood”, a legal doctrine that holds that embryos and fetuses should be entitled to full legal rights and protections. Reproductive justice advocates have long warned that this doctrine can lead the rights of the fetus to be prioritized above those of the person carrying it. “We didn’t have a choice or a say about it,” Newkirk said before Chance’s birth. “We want the baby. That’s a part of my daughter. But the decision should have been left to us – not the state.” Newkirk said that doctors had informed her they had no choice but to keep Smith on life support, but the hospital has declined to comment on Smith’s case, citing privacy rules. In a statement to the Associated Press, the hospital said it “uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.” However, the office of Georgia’s attorney general, Chris Carr, released a statement saying that Georgia’s ban does not require medical professionals to keep women alive on life support after being declared brain dead. “Removing life support is not an action with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” Carr’s spokesperson, Kara Murray, said in the statement. Newkirk told 11Alive that, if she could speak to Smith again, she would tell her she was a good daughter. “I’m her mother,” Newkirk said. “I shouldn’t be burying my daughter. My daughter should be burying me.”","2025-06-17T20:10:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/brain-dead-georgia-woman-delivers-baby"
"abortion","Trump signs executive order expanding access to IVF, says White House","Donald Trump has signed an executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF). The order directs the domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the costs for accessing IVF, according to a White House fact sheet. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Twitter/X that the order was evidence of the president’s “promises kept” – even though the order does not directly change any policy and does not, on its own, fulfill Trump’s campaign pledge to make the government or insurance companies cover IVF. “Americans need reliable access to IVF and more affordable treatment options, as the cost per cycle can range from $12,000 to $25,000,” the fact sheet reads. “It is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.” During the 2024 presidential election, Trump recast his position on IVF as a strong supporter of the treatment, declaring himself the “father of IVF” while at the same time admitting he only recently discovered what the procedure involved. Trump’s campaign promise to in effect make IVF freewas criticized by Democrats who accused him of softening his stance only after voters signaled broad support for reproductive rights. After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in a decision backed by three justices that Trump appointed, Republicans tried to distance themselves from the anti-abortion movement as pro-abortion rights supporters repeatedly won ballot measures even in red states. Trump’s Tuesday order may now drive a further wedge between the Trump administration and the anti-abortion movement. The news of the order unleashed a torrent of complaints from anti-abortion activists, who are largely opposed to IVF because it can create unused embryos (which they consider to be people). Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life of America, tweeted that the news was “tragic” and compared IVF with eugenics. “IVF turns children into a product to be created, sold, and discarded – violating their basic human rights,” tweeted Lila Rose, the leader of the anti-abortion group Live Action. In another tweet, she added: “IVF is NOT pro-life.”","2025-02-18T22:40:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/18/trump-ivf-executive-order"
"abortion","Trump and Powell clash on camera over Federal Reserve renovation cost – as it happened","This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day. Here are the latest developments: Donald Trump tried and failed to ambush Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, during an on-camera exchange as the president inspected the renovation of the central bank’s historic headquarters in Washington. The US supreme court temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have significantly limited the power of the Voting Rights Act and only allowed the Justice Department to file claims under the landmark civil rights law. Trump’s hand-picked chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, announced that “the FCC approved Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount”. Deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who was Trump’s criminal defense lawyer just last year, wrote that after meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell, a former socialite who was convicted of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls, he intends to spend more time interviewing her on Friday. A leather-bound book of birthday greetings presented to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 included messages from about 20 associates listed as “Friends”, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz, the Wall Street Journal reports. As Trump continues to insist that a letter and drawing attributed to him by the Wall Street Journal in leather-bound book of birthday greetings presented to Epstein in 2003 is “fake”, the New York Times reports that Trump’s name appears in a list of contributors to the book it has reviewed. Greg Kelly, a host on the partisan, pro-Trump network Newsmax told his viewers on Wednesday night that Maxwell “just might be a victim”. Greg Kelly, a host on the partisan, pro-Trump network Newsmax told his viewers on Wednesday night that Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls, “just might be a victim”. “There was a rush to judgment”, Kelly said. “All right, granted, she hung out with Jeffrey Epstein, and I know that’s apparently not good, but she’s in jail. For how long now? 20 years.” Kelly then introduced comments from Alan Dershowitz, who told another Newsmax host that Maxwell should not be in jail. Dershowitz, Kelly did not note, was an associate of Epstein’s who, according to a Wall Street Journal report, contributed to a leather-bound album of birthday greetings assembled by Maxwell in 2003. “She deserves to be out”, Kelly told his viewers. “And maybe she never deserved to be in there in the first place. Now, how could you say such a thing? I mean, these are perverts. These are child molesters. We’ve heard that from whom? From the media, from prosecutors. Prosecutors prosecuted President Trump over nothing. I don’t know, but I’m skeptical of everything and everybody these days. And you should be too.” He went on to suggest that the fact that Maxwell was prosecuted by James Comey’s daughter was, in itself, enough for a commutation of her sentence. As Donald Trump continues to insist that a letter and drawing attributed to him by the Wall Street Journal in leather-bound book of birthday greetings presented to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 is “fake”, the New York Times reports that Trump’s name appears in a list of contributors to the book it has reviewed. The Times also published what it described as an image of the handwritten introduction to the book from Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend who was later convicted of conspiring with him to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls. The Times also published an image of a signed note to Epstein, “To Jeff – You are the greatest!” as an inscription in a copy of Trump’s book Trump: the Art of the Comeback that belonged to Epstein. The note, written in Trump’s distinctive handwriting and black Sharpie, was dated “Oct 97”, the month Trump’s book was first published. Trump wrote that book with Kate Bohner, a former investment banker and CNBC journalist who now runs a bespoke communications firm that lists “crisis management” as one of its specialities. A leather-bound book of birthday greetings presented to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 included messages from about 20 associates listed as “Friends”, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the Journal, which is being sued by Trump over its initial report that he contributed a page with an imagined dialogue between “Donald” and “Jeffrey” and a sketch of a naked woman, about 60 people contributed to the birthday book, which had a table of contents that listed the contributions, organized into groups, including “Friends”, “Business”, “Science”, “Brooklyn” and “Family”. Mark Epstein, the late sex offender’s brother, told the Journal that he recalled the book, which included a note from him, being assembled by Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend who was later convicted of conspiring with him to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls. Mark Epstein told the Guardian in an interview on Thursday that if he had the opportunity he would ask Maxwell “what she and Jeffrey might have known what the dirt was on Donald Trump”. “Because Jeffrey said, he said he had dirt on Trump,” Mark Epstein added. “I don’t know what it was, but years ago he said he had dirt on Trump.” In his federal lawsuit, Trump called the letter attributed to him “fake and nonexistent”. “Several digital copies of the album have been created” the Journal reports. “Pages have been reviewed by justice department officials who investigated Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell years ago, according to people familiar with the matter. The album is part of Epstein’s estate.” Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer, Todd Blanche, who is now the deputy attorney general, met with Maxwell in federal prison on Friday and plans to meet her again on Saturday. Maxwell is trying to have her conviction overturned. Deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who was Donald Trump’s criminal defense lawyer just last year, wrote on social media that after meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell, a former socialite who was convicted of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom and sexually abuse girls, he intends to spend more time interviewing her in federal prison on Friday. “The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time,” Blanche added. “We want to thank the deputy attorney general for being so professional with all of us and for taking the time to meet with us,” Maxwell’s lawyer, David Oscar Markus told reporters after Thursday’s interview. According to Markus, Blanche “spent the full day and asked a lot of questions, and Ms Maxwell answered every single one”. Maxwell is seeking to have her conviction overturned. Blanche’s meetings with Maxwell come as the Trump administration tries to contain outrage over its decision to not release files from the federal investigation of the late sex offender, who socialized with Trump for more than a decade. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a former federal prosecutor, called Blanche’s meeting with Maxwell “very weird”, and asked “is he really going as [deputy attorney general] or is he going de facto as Trump’s personal criminal attorney, Tom Hagen style?” Tom Hagen was the family lawyer in the fictional Godfather series. In one memorable scene, he visited a former gangster in custody and convinced him to kill himself rather than testify against his former associates. As Whitehouse pointed out earlier on Thursday, Trump is suing the Wall Street Journal for reporting that he contributed a bawdy birthday message to Epstein in 2003 for a leather-bound book of birthday greetings from his associates that Maxwell reportedly assembled. “Maxwell is a likely witness in Trump’s lawsuit against the WSJ if she put the book together and obtained the Trump letter,” Whitehouse posted. Just last year, after Blanche defended Trump in court on criminal charges of making secret payments to a porn star during his 2016 campaign, he was a guest on Markus’s podcast. In an account of his first meeting with Trump, Blanche said: “We clicked. You know, he’s an enigma.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, just responded to the news that “Trump’s government”, as she put it in a post, “approved Paramount’s merger with Skydance”. “Sure looks like they paid Donald Trump $36 MILLION for this merger,” the senator added. “Bribery is illegal no matter who is president.” Donald Trump’s hand-picked chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, just announced that “the FCC approved Skydance’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global and its subsidiaries, including the ultimate parent company of the CBS network of owned and operated broadcast television stations, by granting a series of applications that transfer FCC licenses and authorizations.” According to Carr, Skydance, whose founder is David Ellison, son of the pro-Trump tech billionaire Larry Ellison, “has made written commitments” to ensure that the new company’s news and entertainment programming will address conservative grievances that CBS News reporting is biased against them and the new owners will stop all efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Skydance also agreed to appoint an ombudsman to “evaluate complaints of bias” who will report to the president of New Paramount and serve for at least two years. “Approving this transaction will unleash the investment of $1.5 billion into Paramount, bolstering all aspects of its operations, including broadcast”, Carr added in his statement. That is precisely the amount of money Paramount agreed to pay the creators of South Park earlier this week for global streaming rights over the next five years. The first episode of the satirical animated series, broadcast on Wednesday and now streaming on the Paramount+ app, mocked Donald Trump as a whiny, would-be autocrat with small genitalia in bed with Satan. It also featured thinly veiled criticism of the company for paying Trump $16 million to drop his claim that the routine editing of CBS interview with Kamala Harris last year was unfair to him, and for canceling Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s late-night show. The South Park episode ended by ridiculing reports that the new Paramount owners had agreed to give Trump $20 million of public service announcement and advertising for free. The episode concluded with a mock public service announcement, ostensibly in favor of Trump, that pictured him naked with a miniature, talking penis. “Trump, his penis is teeny-tiny”, a narrator intones, “but his love for us is large”. The US supreme court temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have significantly limited the power of the Voting Rights Act and only allowed the Justice Department to file claims under the landmark civil rights law. The decision arose from a dispute over state legislative districts in North Dakota. In 2022, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe, as well as individual members, sued the state, alleging they had diminished their voting power by “cracking and packing” them into a limited number of districts. The lawsuit alleged that the redrawn districts would dilute the voting strength of Native Americans in the state in violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, by giving them a chance to elect the candidate of their choice in just one district in northeastern North Dakota, instead of two. A district court judge sided with the plaintiffs in 2023 and ordered new maps. The US court of Appeals for the 8th circuit, which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, overturned that ruling earlier this year. It said private parties – including individual voters and voting rights groups cannot bring claims under Section 2 of the law, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices. Such a ruling would essentially gut the law since private parties bring the vast majority of cases under Section 2. The justices indicated in an unsigned order that they are likely to take up a federal appeals court ruling that would eliminate the most common path people and civil rights groups use to sue under a key provision of the 60-year-old Voting Rights Act. The case could be argued as early as 2026 and decided by next summer. Three of the court’s conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito, said they would have allowed the ruling from the 8th circuit to remain in effect. “We are relieved that Native voters in North Dakota retain the ability to protect ourselves from discrimination at the polls. Our fight for the rights of our citizens continues. The map enacted by the North Dakota legislature unlawfully dilutes the votes of Native voters, and it cannot be allowed to stand”, Jamie Azure, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said in a statement. It was long considered a settled matter that Congress gave private parties the ability to bring claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965. But in a concurring opinion in 2021, Gorsuch invited litigants to bring a case to the court challenging that presumption. “Our cases have assumed – without deciding – that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 furnishes an implied cause of action under §2,” he wrote in 2021. “Lower courts have treated this as an open question … Because no party argues that the plaintiffs lack a cause of action here, and because the existence (or not) of a cause of action does not go to a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction … this Court need not and does not address that issue today.” Shortly after that decision, a judge in Arkansas dismissed a Section 2 case, saying that private plaintiffs could not bring section 2 claims. The Campaign Legal Center, which filed the suit with the Native American Rights Fund and other partners, welcomed the stay for “leaving in place fair maps for Native American voters while the cases progresses before the supreme court.” “To make this decision permanent, Campaign Legal Center will be filing a cert petition to formally request that the supreme court hear this case during their next term,” the nonpartisan, legal nonprofit wrote. Donald Trump, standing in a hard hat outside the headquarters of the Federal Reserve, just completed his tour of the renovations he has repeatedly claimed are too expensive, as he seeks an excuse to fire the head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell. Trump, accompanied by Tim Scott, a Republican senator from South Carolina, met assembled reporters by a podium set up for his remarks. Powell, who has repeatedly asserted his independence and resisted Trump’s demands to lower interest rates, was not present. During the tour, Powell took issue with Trump’s claim that the renovation cost $3.1bn, a higher figure than had previously been claimed, and pointed out that the president had added in the cost of another building that was not part of the renovation and had been completed five years ago. “I see a very luxurious situation taking place,” Trump said. “Too expensive,” Scott chimed in. The senator and the president then said that Powell’s refusal to lower interest rates was making it difficult for Americans to afford mortgages on their homes, and suggested that the central banker’s renovation of the bank’s headquarters at the same time was inappropriate. Pressed by a reporter on why Trump does not speed up the lowering of interest rates on mortgages by firing Powell, Trump said he was not inclined to take that unprecedented step. “Because to do that is a big move and I just don’t think it’s necessary,” Trump said. “And I believe that he’s going do the right thing. I believe that the chairman is going to do the right thing,” Trump said. He then repeated his apparently false claim that, on his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him that the United States is now “the hottest country anywhere in the world, and I thought you were dead one year ago”. Trump met the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on his visit in May. There are no published accounts that he met with the 89-year-old king, Salman, who has withdrawn from public life since last year following health concerns. Donald Trump just attempted to ambush Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, during his site visit to inspect the renovation of the central bank’s historic headquarters in Washington. When Trump paused before reporters to make a statement, he beckoned Powell over to stand next to him on camera. The president then claimed that the total cost of the renovations to the Federal Reserve buildings was $3.1bn, a higher figure than had previously been reported. As Trump made this claim, Powell nodded his head no, to signal his disagreement. “I’m not aware of that,” Powell said. “I haven’t heard that from anybody at the Fed.” Trump insisted that this new figure “just came out” and removed papers from his coat, as apparent proof, and handed them to Powell. “This came from us?” Powell asked. After Trump said that the new figures had come from his people, Powell discovered why the figure for the renovation was suddenly much larger. “You included a third building,” he said. Trump insisted that the third building was part of the total cost of the renovation he has accused Powell of mismanaging in an effort to find some cause to remove the independent Fed chairman who has refused to lower interest rates at the president’s request. The third building Trump suddenly claimed is part of the renovation, Powell explained, “was built five years ago. It’s not new.” Trump was flanked by his staunch ally, Republican senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who also suggested that the renovations had gone too far over budget. Powell, asked if they expected any further cost overruns, replied, “Don’t expect them” but said that the independent central bank was “ready for them” if necessary. Trump then called on a friendly reporter, who asked him what, as a builder, he “would do with a project manager who is over budget”. “Generally speaking, ”Trump said, “I’d fire him.” As Trump, Powell and Scott stepped away from the media to continue the tour, Trump said that there is something that Powell could do to assuage his concerns about the cost of the renovations. “I’d love him to lower interest rates,” he said. Powell has asserted, repeatedly, that the president does not have the power to fire him, as the head of an independent agency, and that decisions on interest rates must be immune to political pressure. Donald Trump has said that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will be present when he and other officials tour the Fed’s headquarters in Washington this afternoon. “Getting ready to head over to the Fed to look at their, now, $3.1 Billion Dollar (PLUS!) construction project,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. The US government has sued New York City, seeking to block enforcement of several local laws its says are designed to impede its ability to enforce federal immigration laws, Reuters reports. In a complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court, the Trump administration government said the city’s “sanctuary provisions” are unconstitutional, and preempted by laws giving it authority to regulate immigration. Donald Trump will today sign an executive order making it easier for cities and states to remove homeless people from the streets, USA Today reports. Under the executive order, the president will direct attorney general Pam Bondi to “reverse judicial precedents and end consent decrees” that limit local and state governments’ ability to move homeless people from streets and encampments into treatment centers, according to a White House summary of the order reviewed by USA Today. Trump’s order, dubbed “Ending Vagrancy and Restoring Order”, will redirect federal funds to ensure the homeless people impacted are transferred to rehabilitation, treatment and other facilities, the White House said, though it was not immediately clear how much money would be allocated. It will require Bondi to work with the secretaries of health and human services, housing and urban development and transportation to prioritize federal grants to states and cities that “enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering, and urban squatting, and track the location of sex offenders”. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement that Trump is “delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again and end homelessness across America”. “By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, the Trump Administration will ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need,” she said. The White House does not support the request by Republican senators John Cornyn and Lindsey Graham for a special counsel to investigate what they call the “Russia collusion hoax,” NBC News is reporting, citing a source familiar with the matter. “While we appreciate the shared goal of transparency and accountability, the president is confident in the Department of Justice to handle the investigation,” the source told NBC. The Department of Justice announced last night that it was forming a “strike force” to to investigate (baseless) claims that the Obama administration carried out a “treasonous conspiracy” by using false intelligence to suggest Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump. A special counsel appointed during Trump’s first term already investigated the origins of the Russia probe. US district judge James Boasberg has said he may initiate disciplinary proceedings against justice department lawyers for their conduct in a lawsuit brought by Venezuelans challenging their removal to a Salvadoran prison in March. Boasberg, a prominent Washington DC, judge who has drawn Donald Trump’s ire, said during a court hearing that a recent whistleblower complaint had strengthened the argument that Trump administration officials engaged in criminal contempt of court by failing to turn around deportation flights. Boasberg also raised the prospect of referring DOJ lawyers to state bar associations, which have the authority to discipline unethical conduct by attorneys. He said: I will certainly be assessing whether government counsel’s conduct and veracity to the court warrant a referral to state bars or our grievance committee, which determines lawyers’ fitness to practice in our court. A justice department spokesperson declined to comment. Boasberg has been hearing an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of alleged Venezuelan gang members removed from the US under the rarely invoked 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. The detainees in the case were returned to Venezuela last week as part of a prisoner exchange, after spending four months in El Salvador’s Cecot prison. The migrants’ lawyers have disputed the gang membership claims and said their clients were not given a chance to contest the government’s assertions. Boasberg said in April that the Trump administration appeared to have acted “in bad faith” when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on 15 March at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess the legality of the effort. In court filings, justice department lawyers have disputed that they disobeyed a court order, saying remarks Boasberg made from the bench were not legally binding. In a 2-1 order, a federal appeals court in April temporarily paused Boasberg’s effort to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt. Boasberg said during today’s hearing that the delay from the appeals court was frustrating for the plaintiffs, and that a whistleblower complaint from Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ attorney who was fired in April, strengthened the case for contempt. Reuveni described three separate incidents when justice department leaders defied court orders related to the deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally. Attorney general Pam Bondi, in a post on X, called Reuveni a “disgruntled employee” and a “leaker”. The United States will not attend an upcoming UN conference on an Israel-Palestine two-state solution, state department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters during a press briefing today. The conference, which has already been rescheduled once, is due to take place next week at the United Nations. The prospects for high-profile announcements on recognition of a Palestinian state had already been dealt a serious blow after it was reported that French president Emmanuel Macron was not expected to attend. Venezuelan men who were deported by the US to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador without due process are speaking out about treatment they described as “hell” and like a “horror movie”, after arriving back home. A total of 252 Venezuelan nationals were repatriated in the last week in a prisoner swap deal between the US and Venezuelan governments, with many able to reunite with family after their ordeal in El Salvador. Carlos Uzcátegui tightly hugged his sobbing wife and stepdaughter on Wednesday morning in western Venezuela after he had been away for a year. He was among the migrants being reunited with loved ones after spending four months imprisoned in El Salvador, where the US government had transferred them without due process, sparking uproar over Donald Trump’s harsh anti-immigration agenda. The US had accused all the men, on sometimes apparently flimsy evidence, of being members of a foreign gang living in the US illegally. “Every day, we asked God for the blessing of freeing us from there so that we could be here with family, with my loved ones,” Uzcátegui, 33, said. “Every day, I woke up looking at the bars, wishing I wasn’t there. “They beat us, they kicked us. I even have quite a few bruises on my stomach,” he added before later showing a bruised left abdomen. Arturo Suárez, whose reggaeton songs surfaced on social media after he was sent to El Salvador, arrived at his family’s home in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on Tuesday. His sister hugged him after he emerged from a vehicle belonging to the country’s intelligence service. “It is hell. We met a lot of innocent people,” Suárez told reporters, referring to the prison he was held in. “To all those who mistreated us, to all those who negotiated with our lives and our freedom, I have one thing to say, and scripture says it well: vengeance and justice is mine, and you are going to give an account to God [the] Father.” Former national security adviser (of Signalgate infamy) Mike Waltz’s nomination as US ambassador to the United Nations is back on track after a Democrat cut a deal to advance him out of committee, Politico reports, marking just the latest development in a rollercoaster day for Donald Trump’s nominee. Despite Republican senator Rand Paul voting no (derailing plans for a committee vote yesterday), ranking member Jeanne Shaheen sided with the other Republicans on the foreign relations committee to vote to advance Waltz, narrowly by 12-10. Having cleared that key hurdle, Waltz now goes to the Senate, where he will likely be confirmed. There was no immediate indication of when the full Senate might consider the nomination. A spokesperson for the chamber’s majority leader John Thune, said there were no scheduling updates. Thune has indicated he might delay the Senate’s annual August recess if Democrats do not allow Republicans to confirm Trump nominees more quickly. In a recent post on his Truth Social platform, Trump urged the Senate to stay in Washington for votes on his nominees. Politico notes: “The partisan swap reflected ideological divides around isolationism: Paul objected to Waltz’s vote to keep troops in Afghanistan, while Shaheen said in a statement that despite some concerns (including the aforementioned Signalgate, which in part cost him his job as national security adviser), she saw Waltz as a potential ‘moderating force’ against the likes of vice-president JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and Elbridge Colby. Some Democrats also worried about who might replace Waltz if his nomination failed.” Shaheen said she had worked out a deal with committee Republicans and the state department to unlock $75m in lifesaving foreign aid for Haiti and Nigeria, Axios reports. However, Shaheen said she may not necessarily vote for Waltz’s confirmation. The US justice department has formed a “strike force” to investigate claims that the Obama administration carried out a “treasonous conspiracy” by using false intelligence to suggest Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Donald Trump. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, announced the new force’s formation after the release of a trove of declassified documents from Barack Obama’s national security team by the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Today, two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn, both members of the judiciary committee, called on Bondi to appoint a special counsel into what they called “an unprecedented and clear abuse of power” by Obama’s administration. “For the good of the country, we urge Attorney General Bondi to appoint a special counsel to investigate the extent to which former President Obama, his staff and administration officials manipulated the US national security apparatus for a political outcome,” the senators said in a statement. Gabbard has alleged that Obama and his senior officials concocted a “years long coup” against Trump – manifested in a special counsel investigation and FBI inquiries – by “manufacturing” intelligence in the weeks after Trump’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton that was meant to show collusion between his campaign and Russia. She has recommended that criminal charges be pressed, including against Obama himself. Trump has embraced her argument and has said Gabbard’s findings reveal “irrefutable proof” of treason. Bondi set the scene for a justice department investigation after Gabbard presented what she claimed was evidence of a crime at a White House news conference on Wednesday. “The Department of Justice is proud to work with my friend Director Gabbard and we are grateful for her partnership in delivering accountability for the American people. We will investigate these troubling disclosures fully and leave no stone unturned to deliver justice,” Bondi said in a statement. Fox News cited a source close to Bondi’s strike force as saying no serious lead is off the table. However, any moves to prosecute Obama are likely to be stymied by last year’s US supreme court ruling granting presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for acts committed in the course of their presidential duties. The ruling was widely viewed as favoring Trump, who has faced criminal investigations for acts committed in his first presidency – including the retention of classified documents. Ironically, it may now form an obstacle to Trump’s stated desire to pursue “retribution” against his political opponents. Obama’s office issued a rare statement on Tuesday, calling the allegations “outrageous” and “ridiculous”. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the administration has decided to bring its consultation team home from the Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha. In a post on X, Witkoff said: We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza. While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith. He went on to add: We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza. It is a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way. We are resolute in seeking an end to this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza. For more on this, you can follow our live coverage of the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza here: Donald Trump’s relentless public – and very personal – criticism of Jerome Powell and flirtation with firing him have previously upset financial markets and threatened a key underpinning of the global financial system - that central banks are independent and free from political meddling. His visit, against the backdrop of his antipathy for Powell, contrasts with a handful of documented previous presidential visits, including most recently former president George W Bush’s swearing-in of former Fed chair Ben Bernanke. Republican senator Mike Rounds told Reuters it’s critical that Powell maintains his independence, but saw no problem with Trump’s visit. He said: I think the more information the president can glean from this, probably the better off we are in terms of resolving any issues that are outstanding. He noted that Powell had indicated “that they have had a significant amount of money, just in terms of foundation work and so forth, that was not anticipated to begin with,” and said of the Fed chair: I think he has to maintain his independence. That’s critical for the markets. I think he’s done a good job of that. Reuters notes that Donald Trump’s visit to the Fed has come about as the president continues to struggle to deflect attention from the political crisis consuming Washington over his administration’s refusal to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, reversing a campaign promise. White House officials ramped up Trump’s pressure campaign on Fed chair Jerome Powell in recent weeks, accusing the Fed of mismanaging the renovation of two historic buildings in Washington and suggesting poor oversight and potential fraud. The White House’s budget director, Russell Vought, has pegged the cost overrun at “$700m and counting,” and treasury secretary Scott Bessent called for an extensive review of the Fed’s non-monetary policy operations, citing operating losses at the central bank as a reason to question its spending on the renovation. The Fed’s operating losses stem from the mechanics of managing the policy rate to fight inflation, which include paying banks to park their cash at the central bank. The Fed reported a comprehensive net loss of $114.6bn in 2023 and $77.5bn in 2024, a reversal from years of big profits it turned over to the Treasury when interest rates - and inflation - were low. The Fed, in letters to Vought and lawmakers backed up by documents posted on its website, says the project - the first full rehab of the central bank’s two buildings in Washington since they were built nearly a century ago - ran into unexpected challenges including toxic materials abatement and higher-than-estimated materials and labor costs. The Federal Reserve is working with the White House to accommodate Donald Trump’s unexpected visit to the US central bank later today, amid escalating tensions between the administration and the independent overseer of the nation’s monetary policy. “The Federal Reserve is working with the White House to accommodate their visit,” a Fed spokesperson said in comments reported by Reuters. Trump’s visit to the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, a rare appearance at the central bank by a US president, was made public by the White House late last night. Trump has repeatedly demanded that Fed chair Jerome Powell slash US interest rates and has frequently raised the possibility of firing him, though Trump has said he does not intend to do so (he also cannot do so over a monetary dispute). On Tuesday, Trump called Powell a “numbskull”, as he has many times before. Trump will visit the Fed less than a week before the central bank’s 19 policymakers gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting. They are widely expected to leave the central bank’s benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range where it has been since December. The visit also is taking place as Trump battles to deflect attention from a political crisis over his administration’s refusal to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, reversing a campaign promise. In a schedule released to the media on Wednesday night, the White House said Trump would visit the Fed at 4pm ETon Thursday. It did not say whether Trump would meet with Powell. Market reaction to the visit was subdued. The yield on benchmark 10-year treasury bonds ticked higher after data showed new jobless claims dropped in the most recent week, signaling a stable labor market not in need of support from a Fed rate cut. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Hulk Hogan, the wrestling star turned vocal supporter of Donald Trump, has died at the age of 71, his manager confirmed. Chris Volo told NBC Los Angeles that Hogan, given name Terry Gene Bollea, suffered a cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida, and died surrounded by his family. Instantly recognizable from his blonde horseshoe mustache and bandanas, Hogan was one of the most popular wrestling stars of the 1980s and considered one of the sport’s greatest of all time. Known for his ring theatrics and sizable physique, he helped transform professional wrestling into home entertainment, primarily through his partnership with Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Hogan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame for a second time in 2020, as he became a more prominent figure in Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) political movement. He starred at the 2024 Republican national convention, ripping off his shirt, WWE-style, to reveal a Trump 2024 T-shirt. “We lost a great friend today, the ‘Hulkster,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. He continued: Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way — Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart. He gave an absolutely electric speech at the Republican National Convention, that was one of the highlights of the entire week. He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed! Senate Democrats’s attempt to force Republicans to vote for more disclosure of the Jeffrey Epstein files failed Thursday morning, the Associated Press reports. The vote marked the first time many Republicans in the the Senate had to take a stand on the matter, the AP reports, as they voted against forcing the release of the case files. The vote unfolded with tense exchanges as the Senate judiciary committee prepared to advance a bill meant to address opioid trafficking. Cory Booker, a Democratic senator, offered an amendment to the bill that would have kept it from going into effect until the Epstein files are released. But Republican senator John Cornyn successfully stymied that effort by offering a separate amendment that nullified Booker’s. Instead, Cornyn said he trusted attorney general Pam Bondi to handle the matter. Republicans on the committee all voted for Cornyn’s amendment, while Democrats voted against, saying, “No on concealing the Epstein files.” Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, broke with president Donald Trump over in an interview with CBS News when he insisted the Jeffrey Epstein case is “not a hoax."" The speaker said he wants “full transparency'” in the case and called for the release of more information. Johnson’s interview with the US media outlet comes amid immense pressure on the Trump administration from Republicans and the Maga base over the Epstein files. “We want everybody who is involved in any way with the Epstein evils, let’s call it what it was, to be brought to justice as quickly as possible,” Johnson said. “We want the full weight of the law on their heads.” Johnson said he had “never seen the Epstein evidence, it was not in my lane.” US attorney general Pam Bondi is facing Democratic calls to testify before Congress after it was reported that she told Trump his name was among many high-profile figures mentioned in the Jeffrey Epstein files, the Associated Press reports. The justice department said early this month that it would not be release the Epstein files despite a clamor from online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and members of Trump’s base. Senator Adam Schiff responded to the report by calling on Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel to appear before the Senate judiciary committee. The justice department declined to comment on the report but issued a joint statement from Bondi and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, who is currently meeting with Ghislaine Maxwell in Florida, saying that investigators had reviewed the records and “nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution.” It’s worth remembering also that the inclusion of a person’s name in Epstein’s files does not imply wrongdoing. Epstein was known to have been associated with multiple prominent figures, including Trump. The meeting between Ghislaine Maxwell and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche is currently taking place in downtown Tallahassee at the US attorney’s office, ABC reports. According to the outlet, Blanche arrived at the courthouse at around 9am where Maxwell’s lawyers were also seen entering the building. Speaking to ABC, Maxwell’s appellate lawyer David Markus said: “We’re looking forward to a productive day.” In today’s episode of Today in Focus, my colleague and Guardian Washington DC bureau chief David Smith reports on the Donald Trump’s troubles over the Jeffrey Epstein case, and how the president risks alienating his own base. Trump has peddled many conspiracy theories in his time. From the baseless smear that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, to the claim that Trump did not lose the 2020 election, to ones even more far-fetched than that. But, as David tells Nosheen Iqbal, there is one conspiracy theory Trump may come to regret. For when Epstein - his estranged friend and child sex offender – died in prison awaiting trial in 2019, Trump suggested that perhaps he had not died by suicide at all … that something far more nefarious was going on in order to protect the rich and powerful whom Epstein had been partying with for decades. In the years since, “Release the Epstein Files” has been a rallying call for the online right, not least among Trump’s Maga base. In particular, they have called for the publication of Epstein’s “client list” – a roll-call of the elite supposedly implicated in Epstein’s crimes. Yet since coming to office, the president seems to have changed his tune, with his administration insisting in the last few weeks that no such list exists, and that there was nothing suspicious about Epstein’s death. It has seemingly enraged some of the president’s own supporters, who have accused Trump of being part of a deep-state cover up – and questioned just how involved Trump was with Epstein after all. You can listen to the episode here: South Park has kicked off its 27th season with a blistering episode taking aim at Donald Trump and its newly minted parent company, Paramount, just one day after signing a $1.5bn deal with the network. The premiere episode, “Sermon on the Mount,” sees Trump in bed with series regular Satan and covers topics including Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, wokeness, Trump’s attacks on Canada and more. Unlike other characters, Trump is depicted as an actual photo of the US president on an animated body. There is also an extended scene featuring a hyper-realistic, deepfake video of Trump, completely naked, walking in a desert. There are repeated suggestions that Trump’s genitalia are small. The episode centers on the presence of Jesus in South Park’s schools, a story covered by a parody of 60 Minutes, in a clear satire of Paramount’s recent embroilment with Trump over the flagship CBS News show. The two hosts refer nervously to “the president, who is a great man” and who “is probably watching”. When South Park’s parents protest to Trump that they don’t want Jesus in schools, and Trump threatens to sue them for $5bn, Jesus begs them to settle with the president. “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount,” Jesus says through gritted teeth. “You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount. You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys got to stop being stupid... He also has the power to sue and take bribes and he can do anything to anyone. It’s the fucking president, dude... South Park is over.” The townspeople eventually agree to pay Trump a much smaller $3.5m, but also must create “pro-Trump messaging” – leading to the aforementioned video of Trump wandering in a desert, stripping naked. Donald Trump has said he would not destroy Elon Musk’s companies by taking away federal subsidies and that he wants the billionaire tech-entrepreneur’s businesses to thrive. “Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE.” It follows Musk’s warning to Tesla investors on Wednesday that US government cuts in support for electric vehicle makers could lead to a “few rough quarters” for the company. Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November’s presidential election and led the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency”’s chaotic effort to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce. The Tesla CEO left the Trump administration in late May to refocus on his tech empire, after his foray into US politics dramatically tarnished his global reputation. Trump and Musk fell out in spectacular fashion shortly afterward when Musk openly denounced the president’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, leading to threats by Trump to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal government contracts with Musk’s companies. Musk’s SpaceX had been considered a frontrunner to build out Trump’s $175bn Golden Dome missile defense shield and remains a natural choice for key elements of the project. But sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week that the administration is expanding its search for partners to build Golden Dome as tensions with Musk threaten SpaceX’s dominance in the program. “Donald Trump and his aides have settled on silence as a strategy to stamp out criticism” of the administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, a senior administration official and Republicans familiar with the White House’s thinking have told NBC News. With the story refusing to die, Trump appears to have switched gears away from a strategy that would usually see his administration officials robustly defending him to the media. Instead, he has signaled that he doesn’t want members of his administration talking about Epstein nonstop, a person close to the White House told NBC. “And White House aides have made it clear that no one in the administration is allowed to talk about Epstein without high-level vetting, according to a senior administration official,” per NBC’s report. Columbia University’s long anticipated deal with the Trump administration after months of negotiations has drawn both condemnation and praise from faculty, students, and alumni – a sign that the end of negotiations will hardly restore harmony on a campus profoundly divided since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza. The deal will reinstate $400m in federal funds the administration cut from the university after it accused it of allowing antisemitism to fester on campus. But it will cost Columbia some $220m in legal settlements, as well as a host of new measures that critics warn significantly restrict the university’s independence and will further repress pro-Palestinian speech. The agreement – the government’s first with one of dozens of universities it has accused of enabling antisemitism and threatened with funding cuts and other measures – is likely to have major repercussions on academic freedom in the US and future relations between higher education institutions and an administration that has described them as “the enemy”. David Pozen, a professor at Columbia Law School, slammed the deal as giving “legal form to an extortion scheme”, he wrote. The means being used to push through these reforms are as unprincipled as they are unprecedented. Higher education policy in the United States is now being developed through ad hoc deals, a mode of regulation that is not only inimical to the ideal of the university as a site of critical thinking but also corrosive to the democratic order and to law itself. “Columbia is choosing to pander to a lawless administration to restore their federal funding – instead of protecting the rights of its students and faculty who are bravely speaking out against a genocide,” said Sabiya Ahamed, a staff attorney at Palestine Legal who has worked with several Columbia students facing disciplinary measures. Columbia is abdicating its mission as a center of learning, and agreeing to operate like an arm of the state to censor and punish speech the Trump administration doesn’t like. With its newly announced policies, Columbia is threatening to bulldoze over the rights of all of its Palestinian and associated students to an even greater degree than before. Libby Brooks and Peter Walker Scottish protest organisers anticipate a wave of resistance to Donald Trump from Ayrshire to Aberdeenshire this weekend as Scots take to the streets to express “widespread anger” at what they termed the US president’s increasingly extreme policies. Trump t is expected to arrive in Scotland tomorrow for a five-day private visit to his luxury golf resorts at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Menie in Aberdeenshire. While it is not a formal trip, Keir Starmer will hold talks in Scotland with Trump on Monday. No press conference is scheduled, but the media (not the Wall Street Journal) are expected to attend the start of the discussions. The Stop Trump Coalition is organising events in Aberdeen in the city centre and outside the US consulate in Edinburgh on Saturday at midday – similar gatherings during Trump’s visit to Scotland in 2018 attracted thousands of protesters. Along with the two main city gatherings, protests are expected around Turnberry and Menie, where Trump is expected to open a new 18-hole golf course named in honour of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, who was born on the Isle of Lewis. A senior justice department official is expected to meet today with Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, ABC News reported last night. Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s close associate, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, among other crimes, in Tallahassee. The justice department said on Tuesday that the meeting between deputy attorney general Todd Blanche and Maxwell would take place “in the coming days”. “President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,” Blanche said in a statement posted by attorney general Pam Bondi on X on Tuesday. Maxwell’s attorney confirmed that day that they were in discussions with the government about the visit, saying in a statement: “Ghislaine will always testify truthfully.” Yesterday her brother Ian Maxwell told the New York Post that she is preparing “new evidence” ahead of the meeting. But there are substantial doubts about her veracity, Politico notes. Among those voicing concern is House speaker Mike Johnson, who yesterday appeared to cast doubt on his own party’s movement toward subpoenaing Maxwell to testify. Referring to past justice department allegations that she is a pervasive liar, he asked: “Can she be counted on to tell the truth … can we trust what she’s going to say?” Indeed since the DOJ announcement of the meeting, suggestions have arisen about her potential motives, given that Donald Trump has the power to pardon or commute her sentence. The Guardian has been keeping up with the changing abortion laws across the US since Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022. You can see the latest state-by-state breakdown here: Here’s more context from the Associated Press on its new poll about abortion: The June 2022 supreme court ruling that overturned Roe v Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion led to major policy changes. Most states have either moved to protect abortion access or restrict it. Twelve are now enforcing bans on abortion at every stage of pregnancy, and four more do so after about six weeks’ gestation, which is often before women realize they’re pregnant. In the aftermath of the ruling, AP-NORC polling suggested that support for legal abortion access might be increasing. Last year, an AP-NORC poll conducted in June found that 7 in 10 US adults said it should be available in all or most cases, up slightly from 65% in May 2022, just before the decision that overruled the constitutional right to abortion, and 57% in June 2021. The new poll is closer to Americans’ views before the supreme court ruled. Now, 64% of adults support legal abortion in most or all cases. More than half the adults in states with the most stringent bans are in that group. Similarly, about half now say abortion should be available in their state when someone doesn’t want to continue their pregnancy for any reason — about the same as in June 2021 but down from about 6 in 10 who said that in 2024. Adults in the strictest states are just as likely as others to say abortion should be available in their state to women who want to end pregnancies for any reason. Democrats support abortion access far more than Republicans do. Support for legal abortion has dropped slightly among members of both parties since June 2024, but nearly 9 in 10 Democrats and roughly 4 in 10 Republicans say abortion should be legal in at least most instances. Good morning, and welcome to the US politics blog. Today we’re kicking off with the findings of a new poll: three years after the US supreme court opened the door to state abortion bans, most adults continue to say abortion should be legal — views that look similar to before the landmark ruling. The new findings from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll show that about two-thirds of US adults think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. About half believe abortion should be available in their state if someone does not want to be pregnant for any reason. That level of support for abortion is down slightly from what an AP-NORC poll showed last year, when it seemed that support for legal abortion might be rising. Other things to note in US politics today: Last night Columbia University announced a deal to pay the Trump administration more than $220m, an agreement meant to bring a resolution to the threat of massive funding cuts to the school. Donald Trump’s effort to repeal birthright citizenship has hit another a stumbling block, with a federal appeals court in San Francisco declaring the president’s attempt unconstitutional. South Park kicked off its 27th season with a blistering episode taking aim at Trump. Trump is expected to heap further pressure on Jerome Powell later today when he makes a visit to the Federal Reserve’s Washington offices. Trump is also expected to sign more executive orders this afternoon. It’s unclear the subject matter, though yesterday he went after “woke” AI models.

"abortion","Anti-abortion campaigner wins control of Brisbane LNP division","A prominent anti-abortion campaigner has won control of a Brisbane division of the Liberal National party, prompting alarm among moderates that “fringe infiltrators” were attempting to increase their influence as polls point to a state election win. Alan Baker, a former vice-president of the anti-abortion lobby group Cherish Life, was elected chair of the LNP’s Griffith federal divisional council (FDC) by two votes on Thursday night. The council controls preselections and campaigns in the federal seat of Griffith, which has been held by the Greens and considered Queensland’s most progressive. Baker has been contacted for comment. Sources have told Guardian Australia that Baker’s supporters turned up to Thursday night’s vote and quizzed the moderate faction’s candidate for chair about abortion. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup FDC chair positions are held by relatively low-level officials within the party structure but have a seat on the state council. Moderates said the election of Baker was nonetheless concerning, as the LNP looks on the verge of winning back power in Queensland. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has promised not to change abortion laws. At the last election, the LNP downplayed its position to review abortion laws, amid concern that the issue damaged the party with city voters. One LNP moderate said it was “absurd” the party would choose Baker to lead a progressive inner-city division. Another LNP source said: “Fringe infiltrators can see an election victory around the corner and are desperate to increase their influence”.","2024-03-22T23:00:04Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/23/anti-abortion-campaigner-alan-baker-lnp-brisbane-control"
"abortion","Supreme court weighs South Carolina effort to defund Planned Parenthood","In its first abortion-related case since Donald Trump retook control of the White House, the US supreme court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case challenging South Carolina’s attempt to effectively “defund” Planned Parenthood because the reproductive health giant performs abortions. The case, Medina v Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, deals with a 2018 executive order from the South Carolina governor, Henry McMaster that blocked clinics that provide abortions from receiving reimbursements via Medicaid, the US government’s healthcare program for low-income people, despite the fact that those reimbursements don’t actually cover abortions. “Payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life,” McMaster said at the time. However, federal law bans Medicaid from covering the vast majority of abortions, which only comprised about 4% of Planned Parenthood’s activities in fiscal year 2022. Instead, people use Medicaid to cover Planned Parenthood’s other services. In the same year, the organization performed nearly half a million Pap tests and breast exams as well as 4.6m STI tests and treatments. It also provided birth control services to more than 2.2 million people. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, a Planned Parenthood affiliate that operates two clinics in South Carolina, teamed up with a patient who sought birth control, Julie Edwards, to sue over McMaster’s order. Lower courts have since kept the order from going into effect. The supreme court is currently controlled 6-3 by conservatives. If the court sides with South Carolina, it could pave the way for other states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs as well as devastate South Carolinians’ ability to access reproductive healthcare and family planning services. Of the 2.4 million people treated at Planned Parenthood nationwide each year, nearly half are on Medicaid. About four in 10 women who have sought care at family-planning clinics say those clinics are their only recent source of healthcare. At the heart of the case is a federal provision that guarantees that people insured by Medicaid can freely choose their own providers as long as they accept the program and are qualified to provide care. The case hinges on a technical argument: South Carolina – which is being represented by the powerhouse Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) – says Medicaid beneficiaries have no right to sue if they believe that guarantee has been violated. Oral arguments zeroed in on this technicality, as ADF senior counsel John Bursch argued that the guarantee lacks “clear rights-creating language”. “It does not use the word ‘right’ or its functional equivalent,” Bursch said. “Nor does it use word with a deeply rooted, rights-creating pedigree, like the fifth amendment’s ‘no person shall’.” The three liberal justices on the supreme court – Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – appeared ready to reject that argument. It’s impossible to describe Medicaid’s guarantee, Kagan said, without calling it a “right”. “The obligation is to ensure that individuals can choose their doctor,” Kagan said. “There’s a correlative right. There’s an obligation, there’s a right. And the right is the right to choose their doctor.” The conservative wing of the court seemed more split. Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared particularly worried about leaving patients unable to seek help if their preferred qualified provider was kicked out of Medicaid. “If I want to go see Dr Jones and that’s the provider of my choice and the state has disqualified Dr Jones … there’s no mechanism, am I right, for the beneficiary to say: ‘Well, you’re depriving me of my ability’ – we won’t call it right, we won’t use the loaded word – ‘but the ability to see the provider of my choice’?” she asked. During arguments, Bursch suggested that, rather than suing, patients could ask the government to intervene administratively. Ultimately, these seemingly narrow arguments, legal experts warn, conceal the broader consequences of the case. If people can’t sue when they believe a state is violating Medicaid, then it will become far more difficult to keep states from discriminating against certain kinds of care, said Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health. “Even though the state is trying to claim that it has sole authority to decide who’s a qualified provider, this isn’t really about whether Planned Parenthood is a qualified provider. It’s about a political calculation on abortion,” Huberfeld said. “Really, what’s happening here is states making politically driven decisions about access to medical care.” A decision in the case is expected in June. “A medical home” More than 1 million people in South Carolina use Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (Chip) – which is closely linked to Medicaid – for their insurance. Almost 40% of South Carolina counties are believed to be “contraceptive deserts”, where there are not enough providers to meet the needs of the people who live there. South Carolina bans abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. Because Texas terminated Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid program in 2021, it offers a window into what happens when people lose access to medical provider. The termination affected the healthcare of some 8,000 Texans. “Planned Parenthood, we heard again and again, was a medical home for people with very few options for providers,” said Anna Chatillon, a research scientist at Resound Research for Reproductive Health, who led a study that interviewed Texans about how the termination affected their lives. “In several different interviews, we heard people talking about showing up for an appointment, finding out that they couldn’t use Medicaid any longer, not having any idea where else to go, and experiencing real disruptions to their care based on that very quickly, but also serious emotional ramifications.” The case is part of a broader, longstanding anti-abortion campaign against Planned Parenthood, which includes an ongoing lawsuit that could bankrupt the organization over allegations that it defrauded Medicaid. On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood announced that the Trump administration – which helped South Carolina make its case in oral arguments – had notified nine of its affiliates that they would lose funding from Title X, the nation’s oldest and largest family-planning program. Politico reported the funds were being withheld as punishment for the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.","2025-04-02T17:33:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/planned-parenthood-medicaid-us-supreme-court"
"abortion","Kari Lake denounces Arizona abortion ban that she once supported","Kari Lake, the far-right US Senate candidate and Donald Trump ally, denounced Arizona’s abortion ban on Thursday, arguing that the strict legislation she previously praised does not have the support of the state’s residents. “This total ban on abortion the Arizona supreme court just ruled on is out of line with where the people of this state are,” she said in a video on Thursday. “I agree with President Trump – this is such a personal and private issue.” In a sudden and apparently strategic reversal, Lake and other Republicans in the state have come out against a ruling from the court on Tuesday declaring that a civil war-era law banning abortion in the state is now enforceable. The law, which predates Arizona’s statehood, does not provide exceptions for rape or incest and abortions are permitted only if the mother’s life is at risk. Donald Trump has said the court went too far: “That’ll be straightened out, and as you know, it’s all about states’ rights.” Republicans in the statehouse blocked an effort by Democrats on Wednesday to repeal the ban, highlighting the disunity within the party over how to handle an issue that will probably define the 2024 race. Lake, an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the state and election denier, expressed her support for the law in 2022 after the supreme court voted to overturn Roe v Wade. “I’m incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that’s already on the books,” she said in a June 2022 radio interview. “I believe it’s ARS 13-3603, so it will prohibit abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother. And I think we’re going to be paving the way and setting course for other states to follow.” An adviser to Lake on Tuesday argued she was referring to a different law, despite the fact that she cited the number of the 1864 code. While Republicans celebrated the decision to overturn Roe, the issue has become a political nightmare for the party. Political strategists have said that the near-total ban would draw moderate voters to Democrats and mobilize young voters and voters of color. “This was an earthquake of epic proportions in Arizona politics,” Barrett Marson, a Phoenix-based Republican strategist, said this week. “Anytime Republicans are talking about abortion, they’re losing. Now, I think the only issue is going to be abortion.” Doug Ducey, the Republican former governor who expanded the state supreme court and appointed the four conservative justices who ruled the ban is enforceable, has said the court went too far. He said the ruling was “not the outcome I would have preferred”. Support for abortion in the US remains strong. A survey last year found that 69% of Americans, a record high, believed abortion should generally be legal in the first three months of pregnancy. Lake has sought to distance herself from her past comments on Arizona’s law and urged lawmakers to “come up with an immediate commonsense solution that Arizonans can support”. Meanwhile, Politico reported on Thursday that Lake was personally lobbying lawmakers to repeal the law. In a five-minute video released on Thursday in which she lavished praise on Trump and expressed her agreement with his position no less than three times, Lake said that while she personally opposed abortion, she supported exceptions for rape and incest. “A full ban on abortion is not where the people are,” she said. She reiterated her support for the decision to overturn Roe, and insisted that if elected to the Senate she would oppose federal funding for abortion as well as a federal ban on abortion. “I’m not going to Washington DC to impose federal restrictions on something that’s already been sent back to the states,” she said. “I’m going to Washington DC to secure our borders, strengthen our families and help President Trump make America great again.” The Associated Press contributed to this report","2024-04-12T00:10:37Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/kari-lake-arizona-abortion-reversal"
"abortion","More US women have tried to induce their own abortion since fall of Roe – report","Roughly 7% of women of reproductive age in the US have attempted to induce their own abortions outside the formal healthcare system, a new study has found, up from 5% before Roe v Wade fell in 2022. The study, published on Tuesday in the Jama medical journal, determined how many people reported ever “self-managing” their own abortion in 2021 and again in 2023 – a timeline that allowed researchers to examine how Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the supreme court case that overturned Roe, has affected self-managed abortions. People of color and LGBTQ+ people were more likely to report having ever attempted to end their own pregnancies. “We think because it’s getting more difficult to access facility-based abortion, that self-managed abortion will increase,” said Lauren Ralph, the study’s lead author and an epidemiologist at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s a really important piece of the puzzle, as we try to understand the full impact of the Dobbs decision on people’s reproductive lives.” Since Dobbs, 14 states have enacted near-total abortion bans. On Monday, Iowa became the fourth state to ban the procedure past about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant. Of the women who reported in 2023 attempting to induce their own abortion, 11% said in 2023 they had used mifepristone, one of the abortion pills typically used in a two-pill protocol, and 13.7% said they used misoprostol, the other pill, on its own. Another study, published in March, estimated roughly 26,000 more people in the US used pills to induce their own at-home abortions than would have done so if Roe had not fallen. Medical experts widely agree that these pills can be used to safely self-manage an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the World Health Organization even offers a protocol on how to do it. Misoprostol can safely be used on its own – but often comes with more side-effects than the two-pill regimen – while using mifepristone alone can result in more complications and is not typically recommended when ending a pregnancy . Far more people tried to end their pregnancies in potentially unsafe ways. In 2023, about 25% of those who attempted to self-manage their abortions used herbs, 22% hit themselves in the stomach and 19% used alcohol or other drugs. Another 15% said that, after their attempted self-managed abortion, they experienced a complication – such as bleeding or pain – that led them to see a doctor or nurse. Asked why they tried to self-manage an abortion, people said they wanted privacy, that going to an abortion clinic was too expensive or they preferred trying on their own first. Nearly 13% said they were concerned about clinic protesters. Four in 10 people who have ever self-managed an abortion were younger than 20 when they did it, and 9% of people who had tried to self-manage an abortion were concerned about needing parental consent. Many abortion-tolerant states still have parental involvement laws on the books, which require minors to tell their parents about their plans to get an abortion or to get their consent for the procedure. If a minor cannot or will not do so, they have to go to court and convince a judge to let them get an abortion without parental knowledge or consent – which can be a tall ask. Ralph was not surprised to find that so many people who try to end their own pregnancies are so young. “Given things like parental-involvement requirements, given things like difficulty accessing transportation, given things like not having your own bank accounts or having a consistent source of income in the same way that a young adult might, I do think that young people might be more likely to turn to self-managed abortion than their older counterparts,” Ralph said. Young people’s experiences of abortion, she added, had long been understudied. Because people who self-manage abortions can face criminal consequences, Ralph and her fellow researchers used statistical analyses to account for people who may not be accurately reporting their experiences with the phenomenon. Just one state – Nevada – bans self-managed abortion, but legal experts have long warned that if a prosecutor wants to punish someone for attempting one, they will find a statute pliable enough to do it. Earlier this year, an Ohio grand jury considered whether to indict a woman accused of abusing a corpse after she miscarried into a toilet. (It ultimately declined to charge her.) Ralph found that about a third of people in both 2021 and 2023 said that their self-managed abortion succeeded, while a fifth said that they later underwent an abortion at a clinic. Another quarter of people said that nothing happened and that they may never have been pregnant in the first place. Fourteen per cent continued their pregnancies.","2024-07-30T15:03:20Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/us-women-self-managed-abortion-pill"
"abortion","Harris talks abortion rights on Call Her Daddy podcast while bashing Trump’s ‘protector’ of women claim – as it happened","This blog is closed – thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s key developments: Kamala Harris’s interview on Call Her Daddy with Alex Cooper aired on Sunday. The host, whose podcast targets a diverse set of audiences, and the vice-president discussed issues revolving around abortion, reproductive healthcare, housing and student debt relief. Donald Trump delivered his roughly two-hour speech at a rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. The former president was standing behind barriers of bulletproof glass, which is now a standard US Secret Service practice at outdoor rallies. Arizona senator Mark Kelly criticized Elon Musk during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union for supporting Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend. President Joe Biden ordered 500 more troops to assist with Hurricane Helene relief efforts. The troops will move into western North Carolina and assist with the response and recovery efforts after the deadly and devastating Hurricane Helene. Tim Walz said during his appearance on Fox News this morning that Donald Trump’s agenda would destroy the US economy, while he supported Kamala Harris’s plan to lower costs and stimulate job growth. Kamala Harris finished her interview with Call Her Daddy’s Alex Cooper by pledging to fight for student debt relief and listing key issues she hopes to address if she’s elected president. “I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,” Harris said. “I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm. I care about tapping into the ambitions and the aspirations of people knowing that we are capable of so much.” Alex Cooper and Kamala Harris discussed JD Vance’s age-old sexist “childless cat ladies” trope, but Harris was asked what she would do as president to help generations who feel that the economy hinders them from having children. “Housing is too expensive and we need to increase the housing supply,” Harris said. “Part of my plan is to work with home builders in the private sector to create tax incentives to build by the end of my first term, 3,000,000 more housing units.” “Part of my plan is to give 100 million more people who basically are middle class working people, tax cuts, including for young parents, a $6,000 tax cut for the first year of their child’s life, which helps them buy a crib or a car seat or clothing and just get through that first year,’” she added. During an episode of the podcast Call Her Daddy, Kamala Harris condemned Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders after Sanders said that the presidential candidate “doesn’t have anything keeping her humble” because she doesn’t have children. “I don’t think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,” Harris said during the podcast. The vice-president discussed her relationship with her stepchildren, Cole and Ella Emhoff, who are the biological children from her husband’s, Doug Emhoff, first marriage. “We have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both,” Harris said. Kamala Harris was asked by Alex Cooper if she could think about any law that “gives the government the power to make a decision about a man’s body”. Harris laughed and said: “We are a work in progress.” “Part of the strength of our country and our evolution as a country has been through the fight for the expansion of rights. Not the restriction of rights,” she added. Alex Cooper asked Kamala Harris to clarify a claim former president Donald Trump made during last month’s presidential debate, where he falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions “after birth” and “executing” babies. “That is not happening anywhere in the United States,” Harris said. “It is not happening and it’s a lie.” She also labeled as “insulting” his claim that women in their ninth month of pregnancy are electing to have an abortion. Kamala Harris and Alex Cooper continued to discuss abortion rights and reproductive healthcare during a Call Her Daddy episode aired on Sunday. “You don’t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government shouldn’t be telling her what to do,” Harris said in the podcast. Harris added: “What’s so outrageous about it is a bunch of these guys up in these state capitals are writing these decisions because they somehow have decided that they’re in a better position to tell you what’s in your best interest than you are to know what’s in your own best interest.” Kamala Harris condemned former president Donald Trump for calling himself the “protector” of women at a rally in Pennsylvania. “This is the same guy who said that women should be punished for having abortions,” Harris said on Alex Cooper’s podcast Call Her Daddy. Harris went on to talk about the state of abortion access currently in the country. “The majority of women who receive abortion care are mothers,” Harris said. “Every state in the South except for Virginia has an abortion ban.” Kamala Harris responded to questions from Call Her Daddy’s Alex Cooper, elaborating on why she decided to become a prosecutor, the guidelines for reporting sexual assault, and the need to talk about the issue more. In her interview with Kamala Harris, Alex Cooper asked the vice-president about the lessons she learned from her mother regarding mental health, the ways she has taken accountability during her vice-presidency, and what she thinks her mother would say if she became the next president of the United States. Later on, Cooper referenced some of the harsh descriptions former president Donald Trump has used against Harris during the race, including questioning her mental health. She asked Harris how this affected her. Harris said: I think it’s really important not to let other people define you, and usually those people who will attempt to do it don’t know you. Donald Trump finished his remarks in Juneau, Wisconsin, which ran for about two hours. During her interview with Kamala Harris, Call Her Daddy host Alex Cooper quickly touched on a soft spot for the Harris campaign, which is the vice-president’s lack of interviews with the media. She asked Harris why she decided to come on the podcast. “I think you and your listeners have really got this thing, right, which is one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real, you know, and to talk about the things that people really care about,” Harris said. “What I love about what you do is that your voice in your show is really about your listeners,” she added. “And I think especially now, this is a moment in the country and in life where people really want to know they’re seen and heard and that they’re part of a community, that they’re not out there alone.” The host of the comedy and advice podcast Call Her Daddy, Alex Cooper, said at the start of her episode with Kamala Harris that she invited former president Donald Trump to come on the show. “If he also wants to have a meaningful, in-depth conversation about women’s rights in this country, then he is welcome on Call Her Daddy anytime,” Cooper said. Kamala Harris’s interview on Call Her Daddy with Alex Cooper just dropped. The host, who targets a diverse set of audiences, begins the episode by explaining to her listeners why she decided to interview the vice-president. “As you guys know, I do not usually discuss politics or have politicians on the show,” Cooper said. “At the end of the day, I couldn’t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I’m not a part of it.” Trump brought Dodge county sheriff Dale Schmidt to the stage, along with a group of other Wisconsin sheriffs. “I am proud to announce that all of these sheriffs are among a very small amount of sheriffs and law enforcement across our country that support you,” Schmidt said. “In Dodge county, in this 2024 election, there are zero drop boxes for the election,” the sheriff said proudly. Eric Hovde, Republican Senate candidate in Wisconsin took the stage during Trump’s rally. Hovde attacked his rival Tammy Baldwin and said: “All of you go work hard, go grab every friend, colleague, neighbor, and let’s restore this great country and get President Trump and me to Washington.” Trump also invited Republican senator Ron Johnson to the stage. He congratulated Trump for his alliance with the ex-independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr. “We are actually going through a huge problem with chronic health and children’s health, but you are right about the enemy within. They are dividing us. They are destroying this nation. And by aligning with Bobby Kennedy, you are setting the example,” Johnson said. Kennedy has been campaigning for Trump since he ended his own independent presidential bid to support the Republican nominee. Donald Trump baselessly linked inflation and the country’s economic woes to the influx of migrants in the US. He falsely claimed leaders in other countries are emptying their jails and sending inmates to the US. He later presented a chart that shows the rate of migrant entries in the US, suggesting a decline during his presidency. “I kiss it every night,” Trump said about his chart. “I take it to bed with me every single night.” Donald Trump called Wisconsin governor Tony Evers a “lousy governor”. “I hate to say it with your Democrat governor, you have some of the highest electricity prices, and highest energy costs is just about at the top in Wisconsin,” Trump said. He then said he plans to double the electricity production for the development of artificial intelligence. “We need tremendous electric here so that other people that are into this whole world of this, it’s a new world, but it’s going to be a very big world, a very fascinating world,” he said about the field of AI. Donald Trump attacked Kamala Harris’s tax policy, calling her a “tax queen” and misleading attendees with a claim that Harris plans to raise taxes on US families. “I’ve never seen somebody that openly campaigns on the fact that they’re going to raise taxes,” Trump said. He then showed a campaign ad, composed of a compilation of clips of Harris saying wants to raise taxes. In reality, Harris has said she plans to cut corporate tax rates. Donald Trump said rifle owners and the Christian community don’t vote “as much as they should”. “Evangelicals don’t vote that much, and if they did vote, we could never lose an election,” he said. Donald Trump claimed that the media favors Kamala Harris in their coverage and they “hate our country”. He continued to make anti-immigrant and transphobic comments. “I can’t understand. Why do they want open borders? Why do they want sex change operations for people that are too young to even think about it? Why do they want men playing in women’s sports?” Trump said. “We actually are now the party of common sense,” he said. “I think that’s what I like calling us now, party of common sense.” The former president called Elon Musk a “good guy” a day after the SpaceX founder made an appearance at Trump’s rally on Saturday. He also attacked his rival Kamala Harris, calling her “grossly incompetent”. “Kamala is not wonderful,” Trump said. “With four more years of Kamala Harris, your long nightmare is just beginning.” Donald Trump said the response to Hurricane Helene in the south-eastern US was “probably worse than Katrina”, referring to the devastating storm in 2005. “That’s hard to beat, right? Worse than Katrina. They didn’t do too good a job, either,” he said. Donald Trump called the Biden administration “the most corrupt people” during his rally in Wisconsin. “From the very beginning of this journey, I’ve been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment and corrupt people,” he said. “This country is in big trouble. We’re a failing nation. We are a failing nation. We’re a nation in decline. We’re a nation in distress, and we’re going to get it fixed very quickly,” Trump said. “Just 30 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Wisconsin, we’re going to defeat Kamala Harris,” Trump said. He called his rally on Saturday an “unbelievable evening”, when he returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of his assassination attempt. “We had 100,000 people, and there was love, and I had a fantastic… opera singer, and he went up and he sang ‘Ave Maria’,” he said. Donald Trump started his speech on time in Juneau, Wisconsin. The former president is standing behind barriers of bulletproof glass, which is now a standard US Secret Service practice at outdoor rallies. We’ll be following his remarks. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton dodged questions regarding the results of the 2020 elections during an interview with NBC News’s Meet the Press, where he struggled to admit that Donald Trump lost the race. “Joe Biden was elected president in 2020. It was an unfair election in many ways,” Cotton said on Sunday. “You had states that were changing their election practices or election laws, sometimes in violation of their constitution.” “Joe Biden was elected president. Everything has gone to hell in a handbasket as a result,” he added. Kamala Harris has embarked on a week-long media blitz, hurtling from TV studios and late-night shows to podcast interviews as she seeks to gain an edge over Donald Trump in the US election’s key battleground states that remain nail-bitingly close. The vice-president’s decision to face a raft of largely friendly media outlets came as the campaigns entered the final 30 days. More than 1.4 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting across 30 states. The Democratic nominee’s whirlwind media tour has been carefully crafted for maximum reach and minimum risk. Harris has talked to the CBS News show 60 Minutes, along with the popular podcast Call Her Daddy. On Tuesday she hits the media capital, New York, for appearances on ABC News’s daytime behemoth The View and the Howard Stern Show, followed by a recording with late-night host Stephen Colbert. The first of a flurry of comments from Harris was put out by 60 Minutes on Sunday before a full broadcast on Monday. Harris will appear alone, after Trump declined to be interviewed by the election special which has been a staple of US election coverage for more than half a century. In a short clip released by 60 Minutes, Harris was asked whether the Biden-Harris administration had any sway over the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu, the hardline prime minister of Israel who appears not to listen to Washington. Asked whether the US had a “real close ally” in Netanyahu, she replied: “With all due respect, the better question is: do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.” Since Harris’s meteoric propulsion as Democratic presidential nominee after Joe Biden stepped aside, her relative avoidance of press or TV interviews has become a point of contention on the campaign trail. Republican leaders and pundits on Fox News routinely accuse her of being media-shy. Here’s more on Harris’s media blitz: President Joe Biden said on Sunday he ordered another 500 active-duty troops to move into western North Carolina and assist with the response and recovery efforts after the deadly and devastating Hurricane Helene. “With a total of 1,500 troops now supplementing a robust on-the-ground effort - including more than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 Federal personnel - my administration is sparing no resource to support families as they begin their road to rebuilding,” Biden said in a statement. He also said he was being briefed on tropical storm Milton as it strengthened across the Gulf of Mexico. Milton, which strengthened into a category one hurricane on Sunday, is expected to make landfall on Florida on Tuesday or Wednesday. California representative Adam Schiff said during an interview with NBC News’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that Donald Trump “will contest” the election results if he loses. “If it is close, if Donald Trump loses again, as I expect that he will, he will contest it,” Schiff said. “He has more reason to contest it than he did before, not because of any flaw in the election, but because Donald Trump believes, and perhaps with reason, that if he doesn’t succeed at the ballot box, he may be going to jail. So he’s going to challenge the results.” Republican Senate candidate and former Maryland mayor Larry Hogan said during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union that if he’s elected, he will not support cabinet or supreme court nominees who do not garner bipartisan support in the Senate. “I would make that pledge. If we can’t get any bipartisan buy-in, then I’m not going to vote for that person,” he said. “In Washington, we can’t even seem to get one vote,” Hogan added. “It’s like Democrats will only vote for Democrats and Republicans will only vote for Republicans. If there’s one place that we should not be playing politics, it’s on appointments to the supreme court.” The Charlotte Observer’s editorial board published an op-ed titled: Shame on Donald Trump for worsening NC’s Helene tragedy with political lies. On Monday, Trump accused the federal government and Democratic governor Roy Cooper of “going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas. MAGA!” Trump also said that the Biden administration has “left Americans to drown” in North Carolina and other states. “This is not a situation to capitalize on for political gain,” reads the op-ed. “But former President Donald Trump has politicized the situation at every turn, spreading falsehoods and conspiracies that fracture the community instead of bringing it together.” Here’s more context on some of the false claims made by Trump: Ahead of a rally by the Republic presidential nominee, Donald Trump, in Juneau, Wisconsin, a line began forming near the event venue at the Dodge county airport. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that attendees were greeted by a “larger-than-life Trump inflatable with which some were taking photos”. The former president’s speech is scheduled for 2pm CT, buthe usually starts his speeches at least half an hour after the slated time. During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union, Arizona senator Mark Kelly criticized Elon Musk for supporting Donald Trump. On Saturday, Musk joined Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and made the baseless claim that if Trump’s supporters fail to turn out, “this will be the last election”. Kelly said that Musk was “hypocritically standing next to the guy that tried to overturn the last – the 2020 election on January 6, saying that this is somehow going to be the last election and they’re going to take away your vote.” “It just doesn’t pass the logic test,” he said. “It’s not lost on me, and it shouldn’t be lost on the American people that Donald Trump, when he was president, gave a giant tax cut to billionaires,” Kelly said during the interview. “Elon Musk is the richest person in the world. He’s got a tremendous amount of interest in Donald Trump being elected president.” Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has spent years saying the unsayable to entertain, goad and grab attention. But his pronouncements over the past few weeks have plumbed new depths of absurdity and incoherence. Trump, 78, increasingly slurs or stumbles over his words, raising fears over cognitive decline. He is slipping in polls against Kamala Harris and knows that defeat could lead to criminal trials and even prison. After a decade of dominating American politics, critics say, Trump could be in the throes of a final meltdown. His verbal output now is “absolute batshittery”, according to Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. “These are not the musings of a well-adjusted adult. He demonstrates daily how unfit he is to have the most powerful position in the world.” Trump was mostly given a pass by the mainstream media, Setmayer added, because of the intense focus on Joe Biden’s age and mental acuity when he was still running. “Now the focus is solely on him because he is the oldest candidate in this race. His kookery is even more highlighted now than before because he is alone on an island with his deterioration.” Trump has always thrown dead cats on tables, as the metaphor goes, offering his fans the thrill of transgression and watching with glee as liberals howl with outrage. His run for president in 2016 was characterised by racially divisive rhetoric and a constant stream of controversies that dominated news cycles and forced rival Hillary Clinton into reactive mode. Here’s more on Trump’s recent pronouncements: Speaker Mike Johnson sidestepped questions on the results of the 2020 race during an interview on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. “It’s a gotcha game. You want us to litigate things that happened four years ago when we’re talking about the future,” Johnson said. “Joe Biden has been the president for almost four years. Everybody needs to get over this and move forward,” he added. Governor Tim Walz is expected to arrive at Santa Barbara, California, on Sunday to kick off a West Coast fundraising blitz on behalf of the Harris Victory Fund. The Democratic vice-presidential pick will make his way through California and Washington, delivering campaign remarks in cities along the coast. Walz is scheduled to deliver remarks at receptions in San Diego, Montecito, Los Angeles, and Sacramento before heading up to Washington. CBS’s 60 Minutes will air an interview with Kamala Harris on Monday. The network released a sneak peek into the interview, where Bill Whitaker asked Harris if the US lacks influence over Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,” Harris said. “When we think about the threat that Hamas Hezbollah presents [and] Iran, I think that it is, without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.” During his appearance on Fox News this morning, Tim Walz said Donald Trump’s agenda would destroy the American economy, while he supported Kamala Harris’s plan to lower costs and stimulate job growth. “Well, we saw a blockbuster jobs report this week,” Walz said. “We saw interest rates come down, and we’ve also seen that Vice-President Harris is laying out a middle-class agenda.” He added: “I was in Ohio yesterday, in Cleveland, in Cincinnati, and talking about this. Folks in Ohio know that Donald Trump’s policies led to 180,000 manufacturing jobs leaving.” Melania Trump was asked whether Donald Trump knew she would express strong support for abortion rights in her upcoming memoir, where she emphasized that women should have the autonomy to decide whether to have children based on their own convictions, without government interference or pressure. “Yes, he knew my position and my beliefs since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom,” she said. “I want to decide what I wanted to do with my body. I think I don’t want government in my personal business,” she added. Former first lady Melania Trump sat down with Fox News’s Maria Bartiromo this morning, where she showed her unwavering support for her husband, Donald Trump. “I don’t believe in polls. I never did,” she said. “I think in the end, people really see it, what’s going on in the country and how this leadership is performing.” The Democratic vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, sat down with Fox News Sunday’s Shannon Bream, where he discussed how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has affected women. “The real issue here is women being forced into miscarriages, women being forced to go back home, get sepsis and potentially die,” Walz said. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at an event in Juneau, Wisconsin, on Sunday, his fourth scheduled stop in eight days in the state. Republicans are trying to rack up support in Wisconsin, which has only flipped red once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz are slated to sit down with major TV personalities this week. Walz is slated to sit down with Fox News’s Shannon Bream on Sunday for his first solo interview. On Monday, he’ll join Jimmy Kimmel Live. On Tuesday, Harris will be in New York for appearances on The View, The Howard Stern Show, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Here’s what else is happening: After the US supreme court granted Donald Trump significant immunity from prosecution for actions during his presidency, the court is set to embark on its next nine-month term on Monday with public confidence in the court still reeling following the ruling compounded by the ethically dubious conduct of some justices. The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.

Currently “economically inactive/domestic goddess” Voting record Labour in UK elections; for the Scottish parliament, first vote Green, second vote SNP. Describes herself as a leftie Amuse bouche In February, Allison won £500 for a 247-word story in a flash-fiction competition. More than £2 a word: “quite a good return” Michael, 34, Edinburgh Occupation Computer science researcher within academia Voting record Michael, from Malta, came to the UK in 2017. In Malta he usually voted for the Nationalist party. In Scotland he votes SNP Amuse bouche Michael once went straight from the beach to a formal ceremony in his wife’s town in Italy. He sat next to the mayor wearing wet swimming trunks For starters Allison I was intrigued to learn Michael was from Malta. And he could speak to the friendly waiter in Italian, so mille grazie for that. Michael To begin with, the conversation was a bit robotic, but we got on to our kids, and realised we’d both been involved in dementia research. I work in dementia modelling, and Allison had worked for Alzheimer’s Research UK. Then everything warmed up. Allison I had some very tender pork with dates and pistachios, washed down with lashings of good house red. Michael had the steak, and nobly allowed me a spoonful of his tiramisu. It was all delicious. The big beef Allison I’ve heard somebody dying in pain in a hospice. There’s a noise you make when you’re in labour because you’re in so much pain, and that’s the sound the woman was making. Her relatives were weeping in the corridor – it seemed inhumane. That’s why assisted dying should be an option. Michael Within the Catholic church, if someone is administered drugs with the intention of reducing pain, and as a side-effect that causes someone to die quicker, that’s OK. It’s not about prolonging life at all costs; it’s about respecting the dignity of human life. Allison Assisted dying is working well in other countries. It feels like another mark of civilised society that we would, with sufficient safeguards, allow this to be put in place. Michael My view is informed mostly by my faith, but there are issues about the safeguards. Allison said it has to be the person concerned who pushes the button. But when someone is in extreme pain or has dementia, they can’t really be objective about it. In countries where it has happened, the law has been relaxed, and it goes on and on. I’m pretty sure that at least some of the MPs who voted against did so because of the slippery slope. Sharing plate Michael We agreed that the state of the US political system is a nightmare. Neither of us is a big fan of Trump. Allison We both enjoyed the food, and talking about parenthood … but there was much more uncommon ground. For afters Michael On abortion I believe a baby is a human being from the moment of conception. You should have the rights over your body. But even that is qualified in law. For example, there are laws for using seatbelts – even though if you don’t use a seatbelt you’re harming only yourself. In abortion, it’s riskier because there is a human being growing in the womb. Allison Michael thinks it is for God to give life and for God to take life away. I’m not just an atheist, I’m an angry female atheist. I’m angry about how some religions try to control women’s bodies. We talked about the Catholic church and how there had been a number of cardinals discredited in terrible scandals, and there was an irony in elderly, supposedly celibate priests giving women advice about reproductive health. Michael thinks Catholicism actually values women because they revere the Holy Mother, and he said there are some powerful nuns. Then the tiramisu arrived. Takeaways Michael It was refreshing to have a respectful – I would say loving – conversation in a very polarised society. I still believe in absolute moral truths, but I also appreciate that most people are good at heart. Allison We left at 9.20pm, long enough to be at polar opposites. At no point was it unpleasant.

"abortion","Arizona Republicans denounce revived 1864 abortion ban in sudden reversal","Hours after Arizona’s supreme court declared on Tuesday that a 160-year-old abortion ban is now enforceable, Republicans in the state took a surprising stance for a party that has historically championed abortion restrictions – they denounced the decision. “This decision cannot stand,” said Matt Gress, a Republican state representative. “I categorically reject rolling back the clock to a time when slavery was still legal and we could lock up women and doctors because of an abortion.” First passed when Arizona was still a territory, the ban only permits abortions to save a patient’s life and does not have exceptions for rape or incest. “Today’s Arizona supreme court decision reinstating an Arizona territorial-era ban on all abortions from more than 150 years ago is disappointing to say the least,” said TJ Shope, a Republican state senator. “I oppose today’s ruling,” added Kari Lake, a Republican running to represent Arizona in the US Senate and a Donald Trump loyalist. Lake called on the state legislature to “come up with an immediate commonsense solution that Arizonans can support”. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, leading the GOP to stumble in the 2022 midterms and abortion rights supporters to win a string of ballot measures, including in purple and red states, Republicans have struggled to find a way to talk about abortion without turning off voters. But their response to the ruling on the 1864 ban may mark their fastest and strongest rebuke of abortion bans since Roe fell. “This is an earthquake that has never been seen in Arizona politics,” said Barrett Marson, a Republican consultant in Arizona, of the decision. “This will shake the ground under every Republican candidate, even those in safe legislative or congressional seats.” The 1864 ban is not currently in effect, and may not go into effect for weeks due to legal delays. Abortion is currently allowed in Arizona up until 15 weeks of pregnancy. Some of the criticisms of the Tuesday ruling came from politicians who had previously supported the 1864 ban or cheered the end of Roe v Wade. Lake previously called the ban a “great law”, according to PolitiFact. David Schweikert, an Arizona congressman who is facing one of the most competitive House races in the country this November, said on Tuesday that he does not support the ruling and wants the state legislature to “address this issue immediately”, but in 2022 said the fall of Roe “pleased” him. The speaker of the Arizona state house and the president of the state senate, who are both Republicans, also released a joint statement saying that they would be “listening to our constituents to determine the best course of action for the legislature”. In contrast, on the day Roe fell, the Republican-controlled state senate released a statement declaring that the 1864 ban was in effect immediately. That statement unleashed confusion and chaos among abortion providers in Arizona, prompting them to stop offering the procedure out of an abundance of caution. “They are trying to play it both ways. They’re trying to have this illusion that they’re moderate to get votes, because they know that Arizonans do not want a total ban,” said Dr Gabrielle Goodrick, one of the providers who temporarily stopped performing abortions when Roe fell. “This is just ridiculous. Now they’re saying that they oppose it? Yeah, yeah – a little too late.” Arizona is one of roughly a dozen states where voters may be able to directly decide abortion rights come November. Activists in the state have now collected more than half a million signatures in favor of giving Arizona residents a chance to vote on a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Democrats hope that turnout for this proposal, which has yet to be officially added to the ballot, will also lead to surge in support for their candidates, including Joe Biden. A similar dynamic is at play in Florida, whose state supreme court recently paved the way for a six-week abortion ban, and where voters will be able to vote in November to constitutionally protect abortion. The decision also exposed the deepening rift between Republicans and their longtime allies in the anti-abortion movement. As Arizona Republicans raced to distance themselves from the long-dormant law, abortion opponents cheered the decision. “We celebrate the Arizona supreme court’s decision that allows the state’s pro-life law to again protect the lives of countless, innocent unborn children,” said Jake Warner, a senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued the case before the court in favor of the ban. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who disappointed religious conservatives on Monday when he said states should decide their own abortion laws, did not immediately weigh in on the Arizona ruling. Abortion rights are popular in Arizona: nearly one-third of Arizona voters in the 2022 midterm elections said abortion was the issue that mattered most in helping them decide who to vote for, according to exit polling. By a two to one margin, voters in the state said abortion should be legal, and 40% said they felt “angry” about the supreme court decision ending the federal right to an abortion. A poll conducted in late February by the Phoenix-based firm, Noble Predictive Insights, found that 40% of Arizona voters expected Trump, if elected, to attempt to ban abortion altogether, while 45% expected Biden, if re-elected, to increase access. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, will go to Arizona later this week, in a visit that was planned ahead of the Tuesday decision. She blamed the impending state ban on Trump, whose three supreme court appointees voted to eliminate the federally guaranteed right to an abortion. “Arizona just rolled back the clock to a time before women could vote – and, by his own admission, there’s one person responsible: Donald Trump,” Harris said in a campaign statement. “The alarm is sounding for every woman in America: if he has the opportunity, Donald Trump would sign off on a national abortion ban.”","2024-04-10T09:00:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/arizona-republicans-against-state-abortion-ban"
"abortion","The attacks on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota: what we know","Early Saturday morning, Minnesota woke to the news of two targeted attacks on its lawmakers. A gunman killed the top Democratic state legislator, Melissa Hortman, and her husband, Mark, and injured another state legislator, John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette in the Minneapolis area. The suspect, Vance Boelter, remains at large. Here’s what we know about the violent incidents. The shootings appeared to be a ‘political assassination’ Amid rising threats of political violence in the US, Democratic governor Tim Walz was quick to identify the shootings as politically motivated. The fact that both targeted state politicians, and that police soon found a “manifesto” in the shooter’s car, seemed to support that definition. The shootings occurred in two Minneapolis area neighborhoods The gunman targeted the two lawmakers in their homes in Brooklyn Park (Hortman) and Champlin (Hoffman). The FBI named Vance Boelter, 57, as the main suspect. He remains at large Boelter, police say, impersonated a police officer to approach Hortman and Hoffman’s homes, where he shot the legislators and their spouses. Brooklyn Park’s police chief, Mark Bruley, said at a press conference that the suspect drove a vehicle that looked identical to an SUV police squad car. The FBI is currently offering a $50,000 reward in the search for Boelter, who has not been seen since this morning. Boelter was appointed by numerous Minnesota governors to the workforce development board, which is tasked with improving business development in the state. Hoffman also served on the board, though it is unclear if they knew each other. Boelter is married, and runs a private security company with his wife, according to his LinkedIn page and the company website. The suspect’s motivations were politically charged and included anti-abortion sentiments In documents, Boelter listed his political affiliation as “none or other”, according to the New York Times, and later as “no party preference”. He had a list of around 70 other targets, including lawmakers such as US senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, as well as community leaders, doctors and Planned Parenthood sites. His roommate and best friend David Carlson told media outlets that Boelter was a devout Christian and staunchly anti-abortion. He said Boelter texted him that he would be dead shortly. He claimed Boelter was a strong supporter of Donald Trump. Minnesota saw some protests cancelled while others continued peacefully While some Minneapolis demonstrations were cancelled after the violent incidents, others continued and were well-attended, with signs showing support for Hortman and Hoffman. Minnesota’s state house is divided along stark political lines Minnesota’s house of representatives was evenly split between Republicans and Democrats before Hortman died. Democrats have a one-vote majority in the state senate. Police declared Brooklyn Park safe, but the search for Boelter remains under way The Brooklyn Park police department lifted a shelter in place order on Saturday afternoon and said Boelter was no longer thought to be in the area. The hunt for him remains under way.","2025-06-15T01:15:59Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-explainer"
"abortion","First Thing: Arizona supreme court upholds near-total abortion ban","Good morning. The Arizona supreme court ruled on Tuesday to allow a law banning almost all abortions to go into effect. The law was passed in 1864, before Arizona became a state, but went unenforced for decades after the US supreme court legalized abortion nationwide in its 1973 decision in Roe v Wade. “Today’s decision to reimpose a law from a time when Arizona wasn’t a state, the civil war was raging, and women couldn’t even vote will go down in history as a stain on our state,” said Kris Mayes, Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, who also vowed not to prosecute any doctors or women under the 1864 ban. The justices ruled to hold off on requiring the state to enforce the ban for 14 days, giving advocates time to ask a lower court to pause it again. What does this ruling mean nationally? The decision could curtail abortion access in the US south-west and make Arizona one of the biggest battlefields in the 2024 electoral fight over abortion rights. What have abortion rights advocates been doing to counteract this ruling? Supporters of reproductive rights in Arizona are gathering signatures for a ballot measure to enshrine those rights into the state constitution. The rules require 383,923 signatures by July for a measure to get on the ballot; organizers said they have more than 500,000. How have Arizona conservatives reacted to the ruling? With a surprising stance for a party that has historically championed abortion restrictions – denouncing the decision after some had initially supported it. Joe Biden urges Israel to call for a ceasefire in Gaza In an interview that aired on Tuesday, Joe Biden said the approach taken by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Gaza was a “mistake” and urged Israel to call for a ceasefire. Biden’s comments to Univision were some of his strongest criticism yet of Netanyahu amid growing tensions over the civilian death toll from Israel’s war on Hamas and dire conditions inside Gaza. “What I’m calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the next six, eight weeks, total access to all food and medicine going into the country,” said Biden. He added: “There’s no excuse to not provide for the medical and the food needs of those people. It should be done now.” In other news … Aimee Harris, a Florida woman, was sentenced on Tuesday to a month in prison and three months of home confinement for stealing and selling Joe Biden’s daughter’s diary to the conservative group Project Veritas. The president of Micronesia said the US was beefing up military capabilities in the country, considering additional military projects as it pushed ahead with plans for a $400m airport upgrade. A Missouri death row inmate was executed on Tuesday, despite an extraordinary effort by corrections officials and his appeals judge to have his capital sentence commuted. Stat of the day: swapping red meat for herring, sardines and anchovies could save 750,000 lives Red meat consumption has been linked with a higher risk of disease in humans as well as significant harm to the environment. However, forage fish such as herring, sardines and anchovies are highly nutritious, environmentally friendly and the most abundant fish species in the world’s oceans. A new study has found that swapping red meat for forage fish could prevent 750,000 deaths a year and significantly reduce the prevalence of disability as a result of diet-related disease – in particular in low- and middle-income countries, where these fish are cheap and plentiful, and where the toll taken by heart disease in particular is high. Don’t miss this: Bolivia’s hunt for gas Bolivia’s gas production from ageing fields has been failing for years, against a backdrop of fluctuating global commodity prices. These fossil fuel exports were meant to fund a revolutionary leftist agenda. Now the government is scouring the country for gas reserves that could keep its fossil-fuel model of development running, opening up protected areas such as the Tariquía reserve for oil and gas exploration. “Protected areas are the new extractive frontier,” said Dr Penelope Anthias, a Durham University geographer. … or this: the racial abuse of Romeo and Juliet star Francesca Amewudah-Rivers was targeted online with racial abuse after the announcement of her casting of Juliet in a new production of Romeo and Juliet, alongside Tom Holland as Romeo. More than 800 predominantly Black female and non-binary actors – including Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Lolly Adefope – have signed an open letter in solidarity with the actor, condemning the “too familiar horror” of racial abuse that Amewudah-Rivers has faced. “The racist and misogynistic abuse directed at such a sweet soul has been too much to bear,” the letter reads. “For a casting announcement of a play to ignite such twisted ugly abuse is truly embarrassing for those so empty and barren in their own lives that they must meddle in hateful abuse.” Climate check: Biden requires chemical plants to reduce toxic emissions The Biden administration announced a new mandate on Tuesday requiring more than 200 of the US’s chemical plants to reduce toxic emissions linked to cancer and to better protect communities from hazardous pollution. “This rule will reduce a lot of hazardous air pollutants. There will be less cancer based on these emissions, there will be lives saved,” said Adam Kron, a senior attorney with Earthjustice.

"abortion","Arizona governor signs into law measure to repeal 1864 abortion ban","After weeks of national outcry and intense political warfare, Katie Hobbs on Thursday signed into law a measure to repeal an 1864 near-total abortion ban that was passed before Arizona even became a state. The signature of the Democratic Arizona governor is the result of a stunning turn in Arizona politics and the white-hot debate over abortion rights post-Roe v Wade. The 1864 ban, which only permits abortions to save a woman’s life, had long threatened to return to force, but in April the Arizona supreme court ruled the ban could be enforced. The decision unleashed unprecedented outrage in a state that promises to be a major battleground in the November elections – and a handful of Republicans, who hold a one-seat majority in the Arizona state house and senate, ultimately broke with the Arizona GOP and joined Democrats to vote for the repeal. Hobbs’ signature does not alone guarantee that the ban will not take effect. Arizona legislation typically takes effect 90 days after the conclusion of the state legislative session, which may last into the summer. Arizona Democratic lawmakers lacked the numbers to add an emergency clause into the repeal to let it go into effect earlier; although legal maneuvers have delayed the ban’s implementation, the it may temporarily come into force. On Wednesday, Planned Parenthood of Arizona announced that, in light of Hobbs’ anticipated signing of the bill, it was filing a legal motion to ask the courts to hold off on enforcing the 1864 ban. Abortion is currently banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona. Come November, the state looks likely to hold a ballot measure that would ask voters to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution.","2024-05-02T20:22:53Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/02/arizona-1864-abortion-ban-repealed-governor"
"abortion","‘The same faces, swapping places’: Polish candidates aim to break two-party hold on power","Hidden off a charming market square in central Poland, a bar offers the closest physical experience to walking into the internet. Stretching incongruously through medieval basements, Pub Mentzen in Toruń feels like it was designed by someone on a full-fat diet of online politics. As you enter, a gallery wall displays mugshots of “customers we don’t serve”, but instead of rowdy patrons, it features Polish political leaders, including at least five prime ministers. The wall presents a surreal indictment of the country’s political elite. There is a “meme museum”, a blown-up, fake “gazillion złoty” banknote with the face of a former prime minister, and a gold-plated figure of that leader with a begging bowl. In the toilets, you listen to Donald Tusk speaking German and bizarre speeches by other Polish politicians. The pub could be dismissed as eccentric if it wasn’t owned by Sławomir Mentzen, the tax adviser turned politician of the libertarian far-right Konfederacja (Confederation) party that has been tipped to come third in this Sunday’s presidential election in Europe’s sixth-largest economy. And it is not just a commercial enterprise, but an expression of his politics. About 400 people gathered in the rain as Mentzen, 38, came to his home town to deliver a shotgun pitch covering taxes, political elites, public services, EU regulations, immigration, green policies, and the general state of the world. He first rose to notoriety in 2019, presenting “the Mentzen five”: “We don’t want Jews, homosexuals, abortion, taxes and the EU.” He has since distanced himself from that list, but remains on the far-right end of the spectrum. Emboldened by Donald Trump, he seeks to turn his unfiltered language, such as in his criticism of Ukrainians in Poland, into political strength. His rise as the “common sense” candidate – capturing the discontent among younger male voters, and with 1.6 million followers on TikTok – allowed him to briefly challenge the mainstream conservative candidate, Karol Nawrocki, for second place in polls. Recent comments on abortion and tuition fees reversed most of his gains, but in the weeks leading up to the vote he was on course to secure a double-digit vote share. In a well-rehearsed speech – Mentzen completed 348 rallies, visiting all of the country’s powiaty (counties) – he raged against 20 years of the duopoly between the country’s two main parties: Donald Tusk’s centrist Civic Platform (PO) and Jarosław Kaczyński’s populist-nationalist Law and Justice (PiS), which have dominated the country’s politics since 2005. In this election, they have the two frontrunners once again, in the centrist mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, and Nawrocki. “For God’s sake, how long can we wait for something to change?” Grzegorz Płaczek, a Konfederacja MP, tells the Guardian. “It’s the same faces, just swapping places.” This anti-establishment rhetoric strikes a chord. Never before in the country’s post-1989 history was the combined vote share of the top two candidates forecast to be as low as this year. Ben Stanley, a sociologist and political scientist at SWPS University in Warsaw, said: “PiS is far from detoxifying itself after eight years in power, while PO is seen as responsible for the government’s lack of ambition in key areas for younger voters, particularly abortion and housing. That leaves the race more open to others.” Another challenger hoping to break the duopoly is Adrian Zandberg. Born in Denmark to Polish parents, the 45-year-old is a towering figure – literally, nicknamed “the Mighty Dane” – with a booming voice and hard-left socialist views. In the last parliamentary election in 2023, his party, Razem (Together), ran as part of the coalition against PiS but declined to join the government because it didn’t feel it was offered the tools to meet its promises to voters. Now “outside the tent pissing in”, he, too, has become a brutal reviewer of “two 70-year-old men” he says are stuck in disputes irrelevant to younger voters. Addressing about 800 people near Warsaw University on Wednesday, he focused on immediate challenges facing his audience, such as housing and healthcare, as well as Poland’s long-term ambitions. He spoke in an urgent, angry tone – the crowd shouted “disgrace” as he rhetorically asked them about the track record of previous administrations – and urged voters to back a Poland “made of nuclear power, silicon and steel, and not of plywood”. He resists one label that captures his views, having recently said: “I am less interested in the word ‘the left’, more in pro-social and libertarian change.” Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex, says: “For this ‘stuff-them’ electorate, a reaction against the duopoly … the ideological profile doesn’t really matter that much.” Zandberg’s fellow Razem MP Maciej Konieczny says the left’s response to the far right needs to go beyond “old leftwing aesthetics”, adding: “Younger people may not have settled political opinions, but they can smell bullshit and want [politics] to be about something. “And we are credible: because we actually refused to play ball.” Polls published before the country went into electoral silence on Friday night suggested Mentzen and Zandberg would take almost half of all votes from under-35s, streets ahead of the established candidates. Despite polarised views on migration and abortion, some of their voters even suggested they could see themselves voting for the other candidate, instead of mainstream parties. Angelika, a “campaigner on maternity leave”, is not surprised when asked about these views at Zandberg’s rally. “The young electorate of Zandberg and Mentzen want largely similar things: to get stability and live a dignified life,” even if their proposed solutions are largely incompatible, she says. “Instead we get this ping-pong from PO and PiS.” The two candidates could get up to a combined 20% of the vote share on Sunday. That would force the two mainstream candidates who are expected to advance to the runoff to at least consider how to court their supporters. If they fail to do that, they, too, will end up on the wall at Pub Mentzen. And the 2027 parliamentary election is just two years away, with that anger not going anywhere.","2025-05-17T15:15:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/17/poland-presidential-election-candidates-slawomir-mentzen-adrian-zandberg"
"abortion","‘Extreme’ US anti-abortion group ramps up lobbying in Westminster","A rightwing Christian lobby group that wants abortion to be banned has forged ties with an adviser to the prime minister and is drawing up policy briefings for politicians. The UK branch of the US-based Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) has more than doubled its spending since 2020 and been appointed a stakeholder in a parliamentary group on religious freedoms in a role that grants it direct access to MPs. The ADF’s efforts to boost its UK influence are revealed as part of an Observer analysis that shows a surge in activity within the wider anti-abortion movement. Ahead of a historic vote on abortion later this spring, in which MPs will vote on a law that would abolish the criminal offence associated with a woman ending her own pregnancy in England and Wales, several anti-abortion campaign groups have expanded their teams, ramped up advertising and coordinated mass letter-writing campaigns targeting MPs. The findings have led to calls for greater transparency and accountability over the groups’ funding and lobbying activities. The ADF in particular is an influential player on the US Christian right and part of a global network of hardline evangelical groups that were a driving force behind the repeal of Roe v Wade – the supreme court ruling that gave women the constitutional right to abortion and was overturned in 2022. The group – which also supports outlawing sexual acts between consenting LGBTQ+ adults and funds US fringe groups attacking gay, trans and abortion rights – has faced claims its funding is not transparent due to its use of donor advised funds: a loophole in US charity law that allows people to give millions anonymously. The latest financial accounts for its UK entity ADF International UK, published last week, show it spent almost £1m in the year to June 2023, up from £392,556 in 2020, and that its income almost doubled between 2022 and 2023, from £553,823 to £1,068,552. ADF International UK, which has argued publicly against decriminalising abortion, has sought to develop closer relationships with MPs. Its latest accounts show a focus of its UK activity has been attempting to engage with “significant decision-makers” and that staff provided “briefing material and legal analysis” to several MPs ahead of a vote on introducing buffer zones to prevent anti-abortion activity outside abortion clinics. In September 2023 it spent £1,737.92 flying the prime minister’s special envoy on freedom of religion and beliefs, Fiona Bruce MP, paying for her hotel and travel to attend an unspecified conference. Last month Bruce – who reports directly to Rishi Sunak – appeared at an event sponsored by ADF International on religious freedom, speaking remotely alongside two members of the charity. Number 10 did not respond to questions about the links between the ADF and Bruce, who declared the donations in the MPs register of interests and previously voted against legalising abortion and same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Calls and emails to her office went unanswered late last week. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said the ADF had “ramped up its spending” in the UK and Europe “aggressively” in recent years and that there was “no transparency” around “where the money’s actually coming from”. She said its relationship with MPs raised “huge concerns”. “Why are politicians openly working with an organisation that has such a hateful agenda?” Rose Whiffen, senior research officer at Transparency International UK, said the donations to Bruce raised questions about conflicts of interest and that her association with the group could give it credibility in the UK. Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, said it was “very concerning” that the UK’s envoy on religious freedoms was “accepting donations from organisations that use religious liberty as a way of denying others their human rights”. “The Christian nationalist movement is increasingly investing in the UK on a number of fronts, and all supporters of freedom and choice should take seriously the threat to human rights that this represents,” he said. ADF International UK said it was committed to protecting “liberties dear to the British people” including free speech and freedom of religion, and that its stance on abortion aimed to “protect the lives of both mother and baby in every pregnancy”. “Like much of the British public, we are concerned about political initiatives to further liberalise abortion law,” a spokesperson added. The charity, which has an office in Westminster, said it received funds from many countries, like “many UK charities on both sides of the abortion debate”; that claims it was not transparent about its funders were “baseless” and that it complied with all charity regulations. It did not comment on its link to the PM’s special envoy. Jonathan Lord, co-chair of the British Society of Abortion Care Providers and a consultant gynaecologist, said: “We’ve known for some time that these extreme groups from America are infiltrating the UK, having been emboldened following the US supreme court’s actions removing women’s right to abortion there. However the scale of their spending and influence in the UK is disturbing, especially as we know they are actively lobbying MPs and want to restrict women’s reproductive rights, whether that is fertility treatment, contraception or access to abortion.” Other anti-abortion groups have also ramped up activity here in recent months. Right to Life, a leading UK anti-abortion charity, has been coordinating a lobbying campaign encouraging people to write to their MPs to tighten abortion laws, and spent £117,000 on Facebook ads in 2023, 10 times the amount in 2020. The charity – whose overall spending overall has risen from £200k in 2019 to £705k last year – also provides the secretariat to the Pro-Life all-party parliamentary group and aims to “deepen and expand relationships with parliamentarians”, according to its latest accounts. It is currently advertising vacancies for eight full-time staff and says in one ad that the role will include “producing briefings” for MPs and peers. The Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform UK – another anti-abortion group, which notoriously launched a billboard campaign featuring graphic images in pro-choice MP Stella Creasy’s constituency – has increased its staff numbers from four to 12 since 2017. Due to its status as a small company, it does not have to publish details of its income but said it was happy to engage in public debate about its “funding, growth and activities” and that its targeting of Creasy “does not equate to animosity towards her as a fellow human being”. MPs are due to vote in the coming weeks on proposed changes to abortion law that would see abortion decriminalised in England and Wales, as it is in Northern Ireland, Australia, France and New Zealand. Under a Victorian-era law that remains in place today, it is an offence to procure your own abortion. There are exemptions under the 1967 Abortion Act, which permits abortion in cases where two doctors agree that continuing the pregnancy would be risky for the physical or mental health of the woman. But the old law was never repealed and is still used today to prosecute and jail women for terminating pregnancies without sign-off from medics or after the 24-week limit. The proposal on decriminalisation from backbench Labour MP Diana Johnson has cross-party support and is expected to pass. However some in the Labour party fear it could be counterproductive and further embolden anti-abortion campaigning on related issues, such as the remote access to abortion that was introduced during the pandemic. A government spokesperson said abortion was an “extremely sensitive issue” with “strongly held views on all sides of the discussion”, and that MPs would have a free vote on the proposed law change. “By longstanding convention, any change to the law in this area would be a matter of conscience for individual MPs rather than the government,” a spokesperson said.","2024-04-06T16:00:06Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/06/extreme-us-anti-abortion-group-ramps-up-lobbying-in-westminster"
"abortion","Number of births in US increased by 1% in 2024, according to CDC data","The number of births in the US increased slightly in 2024 to roughly 3.6 million, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The small increase of 1% in the number of births comes amid a long-term decline that began during the Great Recession, in about 2008. The provisional data was released on Wednesday. However, at least one demographer warned against drawing any conclusions about a trend from the data – noting that growing US families face sustained challenges in economic uncertainty, housing and childcare costs. “There continues to be very fundamental transformations of fertility and the family in the US,” said Hans-Peter Kohler, a sociologist and professor who studies family demographics at the University of Pennsylvania. In the US, economic uncertainty, the cost of housing and childcare, and changes in how important people feel it is to have children have contributed to a decline in fertility “that is shared among various high-income countries, and I would expect that to continue”, Kohler added. The report showed a record-low number of teenage girls and young women gave birth, while the number of women aged 40-44 who gave birth increased – a trend that has continued almost uninterrupted since 1985. The number of births appears to be buoyed by Hispanic and Asian women, whose birth rates increased. The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics examines data based on nearly all births registered in 2024. The report builds on provisional data released in March. The slight year-over-year increase in births appears largely to be attributable to Hispanic and Asian mothers, for whom the number of births rose 4% and 5% respectively. The number of births declined 4% for Black women, 3% for American Indian and Alaska Native women, and less than 1% for white women. Births were essentially unchanged for Native Hawaiian and Pacific islander women. The CDC report did not address the reasons Americans choose to have children. However, growing US families face a bevy of challenges. The US is in the midst of a childcare crisis, with a shortage of workers, high cost and long wait lists for young children. Still, the Trump administration has proposed slashing education for even the nation’s neediest children, by eliminating Head Start funding entirely. Relative to peer developed democracies, the US government already invests very little in early childhood education. Even so, the Trump administration is reportedly weighing options to push more married heterosexual couples to have babies, an idea supported by close advisers such as JD Vance, the vice-president, Elon Musk and the “pro-natalist” movement. Kohler said he doubted relatively modest proposals would change the fertility rate. “If one indeed wanted to make a profound stabilization or fertility incline one would have to do something very significant,” he said. Challenges families face, he said, “are just of a different order of magnitude than the policies being discussed by the current administration”. The report also did not address the impact of abortion bans on birth rates. The supreme court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. Since then, a dozen states have enacted total abortion bans, mostly in the south and midwest. There is some research to suggest that birth rates and infant mortality in states with bans has increased more than expected, even as tens of thousands of women travel across state lines in an effort to terminate pregnancies.","2025-04-23T04:05:08Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/births-increase"
"abortion","Don’t be fooled. Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ is typically ugly and typically misnamed","What’s big, beautiful and kept a lot of Republicans up late on Sunday night? There might be various responses to that question, but the answer I’m looking for is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Coming in at 1,116 pages, the bill isn’t quite War and Peace but it’s definitely big. Whether the mega-package of tax breaks and spending cuts is beautiful, however, is up for debate. And there has certainly been a lot of debate. The bill has been in limbo for a while because a few Republicans who consider themselves “fiscally conservative” are happy with the package’s extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increased spending for the military and immigration enforcement, but don’t think enough social and climate-related programmes have been slashed to pay for it all. In particular, they want deeper cuts to food stamps and Medicaid, which is a government programme providing health care to low-income people. Late on Sunday, however, in an unusual weekend vote, the hardliners relented a little and the House Budget Committee revived the bill. It still faces some challenges, but it is now closer to becoming law. If you are in a masochistic mood you can read all 1,116 pages of the bill. But the TLDR is that a more accurate name for the package would be the Screw Poor People and Make the Rich Richer Act. Or the Kick Millions Off Medicaid So a Billionaire Can Buy Another Yacht Act. This isn’t to say that every single element of the package is bad. There is one part, for example, where children under eight are given $1,000 for “Money Accounts for Growth and Investment”, AKA “Maga” savings accounts. In general, though, it’s pretty on-brand for Republicans. The deceitful name is on-brand too. The right is very cunning when it comes to legislative framing: it loves hiding nasty intentions behind noble-sounding names that are difficult to argue with. Emotive words such as “protect” tend to come up a lot. If a bill has “protect” and “women” in its name, you can be sure it’s not about protecting women, but about bullying transgender people. The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 (which was blocked by Democrats in the Senate in March), for example, focused on banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. As the National Education Association said at the time, however, it “does nothing to promote equity in resources, funding, or opportunity, or to tackle the sexual abuses of athletes and subsequent cover-ups that have occurred in women’s sports”. Another thing Republicans love to do is to pass entirely unnecessary bills with highly emotive names, in order to amplify misleading information. Take, for example, the rightwing lie (repeatedly amplified by Trump) that Democrats want to execute newborn babies. This is obviously nonsense – infanticide is very much illegal in the US – and is a willful misinterpretation of the fact that doctors may sometimes give palliative care to dying babies. This didn’t stop cynical lawmakers from coming up with the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act (a bill that has gone through a number of iterations but was passed by House Republicans earlier this year) requiring doctors to provide care for children born alive during an attempted abortion. Again, there are already laws in place that cover this. The bill was completely unnecessary but it gave Republicans a great opportunity to conflate abortion and infanticide. “Tragically, House Democrats opposed the bill, voted for infanticide, and opted to deny medical care to crying newborns on operating tables struggling to live,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said after most Democrats voted against the legislation. Republicans have always understood how to use language to manipulate people far better than the Democrats. You may have forgotten the name Newt Gingrich but the former Republican House Speaker has been an integral part in the rise of Trumpism and the current culture wars. Back in 1990 his political action committee distributed a pamphlet called “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control” that instructed Republican candidates to learn to “speak like Newt”. Gingrich was very keen on exploiting emotive language and saying outlandish things that would make headlines and get the media inadvertently amplifying a preferred narrative. The Republican party may now be full of toadies – but you can’t deny they’re all fluent in Newt. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

"abortion","Arizona house votes to repeal state’s near-total ban on abortion","Lawmakers in the Arizona house have voted to repeal a controversial 1864 law banning nearly all abortions, amid mounting pressure on the state’s Republicans. Three Republicans joined with all 29 Democrats on Wednesday to support the repeal of the law, which predates Arizona’s statehood and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The move follows weeks of effort by Democrats in the state legislature to undo the law, while the issue increasingly put Republicans on the defensive in a key battleground state. The measure will now head to the state senate, where it is expected to pass, and then to the governor’s desk. The Arizona supreme court earlier this month concluded the state could enforce a long-dormant law that permits abortions only to save the pregnant patient’s life. The ruling suggested doctors could be prosecuted under the law, first approved in 1864, and that anyone who assists in an abortion could face two to five years in prison. The ruling put enormous pressure on Republicans in the state, who are under fire from some conservatives in their base who firmly support the abortion ban, and from swing voters who strongly oppose the measure and will decide crucial races including the presidency, the US Senate and the GOP’s control of the legislature. Some prominent Republicans, including the GOP candidate for Senate, Kari Lake, have come out against the ban. But Republicans in the statehouse repeatedly blocked efforts by Democratic lawmakers to repeal the law. A week ago, one Republican in the Arizona house joined 29 Democrats to bring the repeal measure to a vote, but the effort failed twice on 30-30 votes. The office of the Arizona attorney general, Kris Mayes, on Tuesday had asked the state supreme court to reconsider its decision, the Arizona Republic reported. On Wednesday, dozens of people gathered outside the state capitol before the house and senate were scheduled to meet, many of them carrying signs or wearing shirts showing their opposition to abortion rights. Anti-abortion protesters sang Amazing Grace and chanted “shame on you”, Jeremy Duda of Axios reported. Some Republicans were critical of their colleagues’ move to side with Democrats in repealing the ban. “I am disgusted today,” said Rachel Jones, a Republican representative who voted against repeal. “Life is one of the tenets of our Republican platform. To see people go back on that value is egregious to me.” The civil-war era law had been blocked since the US supreme court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide. After Roe v Wade was overturned in June 2022, the then Arizona attorney general, Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge that the 1864 ban could be enforced. The law had not actually been enforced while the case made its way through the courts. If the proposed repeal is signed into law by the Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, a 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law. Many abortion providers in the state had vowed to continue providing the procedure until the ban went into effect. In neighboring California, providers were gearing up to treat Arizona patients seeking abortion care. The battle over abortion access in Arizona will ultimately be decided in November. Abortion-rights advocates are pushing to ask Arizona voters to create a constitutional right to abortion. They have collected about 500,000 signatures, more than the almost 384,000 needed to put it on the ballot. The proposed constitutional amendment would guarantee abortion rights until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks. It also would allow later abortions to save the parent’s life, or to protect her physical or mental health. Republican lawmakers, in turn, are considering putting one or more competing abortion proposals on the November ballot. A leaked planning document outlined the approaches being considered by house Republicans, such as codifying existing abortion regulations, proposing a 14-week ban that would be “disguised as a 15-week law” because it would allow abortions until the beginning of the 15th week, and a measure that would prohibit abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they are pregnant. House Republicans have not yet publicly released any such proposed ballot measures. Reproductive rights advocates say the issue has mobilized voters and report that people are seeking out signature-gatherers and asking about locations where their friends and family can sign to put abortion access on the ballot. “I’ve had women come up with three kids, and they’re signing. And I tell them, moms are the most important signature here, because they understand what this issue is, and what pregnancy does to the body, what pregnancy does to your life,” Susan Anthony, who has been gathering signatures in Arizona, told the Guardian.

"abortion","‘I felt entirely alone’: comedian Grace Campbell on the aftermath of her abortion","There it is,” the doctor said, without warning. I turned, the cold jelly sliding off my stomach, to face the screen he had swivelled towards me. There it is, he said, nonchalantly, like he was pointing at the Eiffel Tower as we walked along the Seine. There it is, like he’d found his car in a festival car park. There it is, as he showed me, apropos of nothing, the foetus I was about to abort. In December last year, I was at home, stuck in a sour state of depression that no amount of brightly coloured vapes and episodes of Schitt’s Creek could remedy. After an intense seven weeks, post-abortion, the bleeding had finally stopped. But the persistent crying, self-hatred and grief followed me everywhere I went. Ever since I was a teenager, I’d been under the impression that an abortion was like a really bad period. It hurt for a few days and then, after it was done, back to the pub for a night of gossip. But here I was, 29 years old, floored by a grief so intense it scared me. How could I be grieving something I didn’t know I wanted? Unable to comprehend why I hadn’t just bounced back, I went on Reddit, desperately seeking reassurance. I found a thread where a young man said his partner was still depressed months after her abortion. Below were comments of sympathy, telling him that sometimes abortions take a long time to get over. I instantly panicked. How long is a long time? I don’t have a long time. I felt furious that instead of warning me what might happen, the only medical professional I’d met in this process had showed me what I was losing and simply said, “There it is.” I am obviously pro-choice. I say obviously, not because I assume you know who I am but rather, I assume you know what’s right. But if you do know who I am, you’ll know my comedy has always been described as “sex-positive” and pro “women being able to do what the fuck we want with our bodies”. I am lucky I live in a place where abortions are accessible and I won’t get arrested for having one. Especially, as we’re so acutely aware of the fact that in the US, a growing number of states are making abortions illegal, while in the UK, there has been an increase in the number of women being prosecuted for having abortions after 24 weeks, as well as a rise in far-right MPs unashamedly vocalising their anti-choice opinions. Because I feel so grateful to have safe abortion access, it is daunting to even express the complex feelings that came after mine. But … I want to try. So, I really didn’t plan to get pregnant at this point in my life. A couple of months earlier I’d decided to come off the pill because I wanted to see if my anxiety levels improved on a natural cycle. Newsflash: men don’t like wearing condoms. One night, because of my desire to please a stranger in the moment, I had agreed to forego it. A momentary decision that was followed by consequences that I had to deal with alone. The day I found out I was pregnant there was a mild hysteria among my best friends. They took the day off work and flocked to my house. As they drunk wine, I kept making inappropriate jokes at my own expense while intermittently bursting into tears. “What do you think you’re going to do?” asked Anna. I didn’t know. Confusion overwhelmed me. I’d always imagined I wouldn’t think twice about getting an abortion. I’m Grace Campbell, I like staying out until 5am, not paying my parking tickets on time and sneaking vapes into cinemas. I’ve never thought about having a child. I’ve been too busy behaving like one. But now, at 29, in what felt like my last gasp of young adulthood, the words, “I’ll have an abortion,” didn’t slip off my tongue. The prospect of making such a finite decision freaked me out. I wished I had the grace of time. As ever, my friends became my committee. The mum of one of my best friends called me up to reassure me it would be fine if I had an abortion. She’d had an abortion at my age. “I don’t regret it. It wasn’t the right time for me,” she said. She sounded so sure. But I wasn’t sure and I wondered if perhaps this confusion was in part down to the stage I was at in my life. Everyone around me was having babies, whereas I had just a cruel reminder that I wasn’t anywhere near ready. During my decision-making period, I had to go on a trapeze. I was making an ad for a car company and the idea of the ad was that I would say yes to everything offered to me. Including trapezing and, unbeknown to the producers, perhaps a baby. Right before I mounted the high diving board from which I was supposed to jump, the trainer took me to one side. “Do you have a heart condition?” No. “Asthma?” only around cats. “Any chance you might be pregnant?” she asked. I panicked. I thought about the eight positive pregnancy tests I’d done, all lined up on my chest of drawers. I became paranoid. What would happen to me if I decided to say yes to having this baby and then went on this trapeze and sneezed? Would it fall out of me, mid-air? I considered my options. Option one: have a baby with a man I barely know; see how big my boobs got in a full-term of pregnancy; not be able to go to Mexico with the girls next year; take a baby on tour with me. Option two: have an abortion; take a couple of days off work and then it will be over. The trapeze woman asked me again. “No,” I said, “I’m not pregnant.” “Why do you want to terminate this pregnancy?” the doctor asked. My friend, Holly, who had come with me to the hospital, had warned me I would have to provide reasons. This is part of the UK’s abortion law, that two doctors need to agree that a woman’s reasons for an abortion are valid. So, on the way there, I had prepared an answer I was hoping would make the doctor laugh, because I thought, if I can make the doctor laugh, then my abortion will be OK. “Well,” I said to him, “I am a comedian. And the man who got me pregnant is a musician and I just think that I should spare the world another nepo-baby.” He didn’t laugh. Instead he gave me a pill. I insisted he let me do a toast, to a nepo-baby that could have one day been both the host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live. Holly apologised for my behaviour; an ongoing theme of our lives. The doctor gave me instructions to take another pill the next day. He said I would have some cramps and that I would bleed for a few days and then everything would be over. What he didn’t warn me was that I might bleed for a lot longer than that. In fact, for weeks and weeks to come every time I would go to the toilet I’d see chunks of bloody tissue. He also didn’t warn me I might feel depression like I’ve never experienced before. That I would have a hormonal crash that puts my historical comedown from Bestival 2014 to shame. The doctor showed me the foetus on the screen, gave me a pill, told me some basic facts, but he did not prepare me for what was about to come. That I wouldn’t be able to look in the mirror, or at pictures of myself, for months, because I would totally dissociate from my body in the hope that I would feel further away from my reality. That I would feel a pervasive sense of guilt, for letting go of something that was mine. And that then I would feel shame, shame that feeling guilty was in some way a dishonour to the women who fought for my right to be able to have this choice. What that doctor might never know, but I hope he will now, was that showing me that blob on a screen would provide a photographic memory for a grief I didn’t know I could feel. A grief for something I never knew, but something I know I would have loved very much. And that every time that image would flash into my head for months to come, I’d burst into tears like a child who’d tripped and wanted their mum. I’ve thought a lot about why that doctor showed me the screen that day. Was it because it wasn’t really a baby yet? Was it because he wanted me to be sure? Maybe he’d had people regret their decisions and he wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing. Or was it just because he is a man who has never tried to empathise with what it feels like to be a woman in that situation? I know that this is not everybody’s experience with abortion. I have good friends who really did bounce back quite fast. And I’ve got other friends who’ve had a few and found one much harder than the others. Abortions are not one-size-fits-all. They are a physical and emotional process. And your reaction to them will be affected by what is going on in your life; past present and future. And that is the nuance that we desperately need when talking about abortions. I was nervous writing this. I’ve worried that in doing so I am letting women down. You only have to look at the upcoming American elections to see we are being confronted with loud, powerful men who are trying to occupy our basic right to choose. Women are being controlled and their every move watched, because of the male obsession with taking our autonomy away. And so I wonder if we don’t want to tell other people how hard our abortions were, because thank fucking God we are still being allowed them. But then I think, that is why we are being denied the nuance. In February, four months and a lot of iron supplements after my abortion, I did the only thing that I thought might make it better: talk about it on stage. Abortions aren’t a natural source of comedy. They can be divisive, and in talking about them I knew I’d bring up feelings that other people in the audience have about them. My instinct was that most people would have some connection to it. So I just told the story, as it happened, and it was amazing how many people, of all generations, connected to it. There was a universal truth in what I was saying: abortions can be harder than we are told and too often women are left picking up the pieces of a man’s decision. Last week, I was having a smear test and the nurse could tell I was on edge. I explained that since my abortion last year I’ve felt anxious in medical situations. She stopped, gently put her hand on mine and said, “Are you OK?” a look of genuine compassion in her eyes. “Sometimes it’s harder than you expect,” she continued. For the first time in weeks, I started to cry. Not because I was sad again, but because I wished that she had been there that day when that doctor showed me the screen. To tell me that what was about to come wasn’t going to be straightforward but, crucially, it was normal and I wasn’t alone in that complex type of pain. And to also, maybe, slap him. I am glad that I was able to have an abortion and now I know that I made the right decision. But the simplification of it before, during, and after, meant that I experienced a lot of my grief entirely alone. Up until this moment, I have been nervous to talk about how it affected me on a physiological and psychological level, because I’ve been so afraid my words would be misunderstood or worse, I would come across as anti-choice. But, my abortion had a huge impact on me and I want to be able to say that without worrying that I have let women down. I wish that the world allowed women the nuance of wanting these rights, while also being allowed to talk about the pain that sometimes comes with it.

"abortion","Honduras referred to UN human rights committee over total abortion ban","Honduras is being taken to a global human rights body for the first time over its total abortion ban, which campaigners say violates women’s fundamental rights and the country’s international commitments. The Center for Reproductive Rights and the Honduras-based Centro de Derechos de la Mujer (Center for Women’s Rights, CDM) filed a petition with the UN human rights committee this month on behalf of a woman known as Fausia, who underwent a forced pregnancy after being raped and denied an abortion under Honduras’ draconian laws. Honduras is one of five Latin American countries – along with Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic – where abortion is prohibited in all circumstances, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the pregnant woman’s life is at risk. Until last year, it was also the only country to outlaw emergency contraceptives. Women who have an abortion or medical professionals who perform one can face up to six years in prison. The ban was reinforced by a constitutional amendment in 2021, which raised the threshold of votes needed for congress to modify the abortion law. This strict ban is now being challenged for the first time via an international body. The organisations backing Fausia’s complaint want the UN committee to rule that the total abortion ban is a violation of women and girls’ fundamental rights, and recommend that Honduras regulate access to abortion as an essential health service. They are also seeking reparations for Fausia from the Honduran state over its failure to protect her rights. An Indigenous Nahua woman, Fausia, which is a pseudonym, was attacked by two men and raped by one of them in 2015 in retaliation for her work as an environmental and human rights defender. She could not access the emergency contraception pill due to it being banned at the time, and when she sought medical assistance – despite threats from her attackers – she was met with hostility and intimidation. “I told the doctor that I didn’t want to be pregnant and wanted a termination, and he told me that if I tried to have an abortion, I would go to prison,” Fausia told the Guardian. “It was very traumatic. [The pregnancy] wasn’t something I wanted. I suffered mentally and physically because I simply couldn’t accept that another being was growing inside my body, and the way in which it had got there was not right,” said Fausia, who thought of ending her life and still takes antidepressants. As well as enduring the anguish of an unwanted pregnancy and forced motherhood, Fausia and her family have faced death threats and displacement due to her hard-fought efforts to seek justice. Her attackers were finally sentenced earlier this year, although they can still appeal. “Fausia’s case is not an individual tragedy. It is emblematic of the harmful effects of the absolute ban on abortion in Honduras … and exemplifies the systematic use of sexual violence against women and the complete denial of sexual and reproductive rights,” said Carmen Cecília Martínez López, from the Center for Reproductive Rights. The Honduran state’s strict control over women’s bodies compels more than 1,000 girls aged 10 to 14 to give birth every year, said Regina Fonseca, from the CDM. She notes that the ban does not prevent women from seeking clandestine abortions – an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 take place every year – and that criminalisation overwhelmingly affects poor and marginalised women. Amid disappointment with the lack of progress on reproductive rights under Xiomara Castro, Honduras’ first female president, campaigners are confident the UN will issue a favourable decision that could mark a precedent for change. “Even though UN proceedings take time, I feel optimistic that the Honduran state will be called upon to change its regulatory framework,” said Fausia, whose pseudonym means “strength” in her native language.","2024-04-24T05:00:31Z","https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/apr/24/honduras-referred-to-un-human-rights-committee-over-total-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Colorado voters to decide on abortion rights after measure qualifies for ballot","Voters in Colorado will have a say on abortion rights this fall after supporters collected enough valid signatures to put a measure on the ballot, part of a national push to pose abortion rights questions to voters since the US supreme court removed the nationwide right to abortion. The Colorado measure officially made the ballot on Friday and would enshrine abortion rights into the constitution in a state which already allows abortion at all stages of pregnancy despite the supreme court’s overturning of Roe v Wade. Since that 2022 decision, most Republican-controlled states have new abortion restrictions in effect, including 14 that ban it at every stage of pregnancy. Most Democratic-led states have laws or executive orders to protect access. The announcement on Friday about Colorado’s measure making the November ballot came from the state’s top election official. It would also include requirements that Medicaid and private health insurers cover abortions. Supporters had said they gathered more than 225,000 signatures to put the issue on the ballot, nearly double the requirement of more than 124,000 signatures. Amending the state constitution requires the support of 55% of voters. Those backing a dueling measure – a law to ban abortion – did not turn in signatures, and that measure will not go before voters. The news in Colorado came a day after South Dakota announced voters would decide on abortion rights there this fall as well.

"abortion","Chimamanda has returned to fiction after 12 years. But is the author stuck in the 2010s?","It’s summer reading time, and I have finally dived into Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Dream Count, her highly anticipated return to fiction after a 12-year hiatus. This week, I give a review of sorts – what was most striking about the work is how it feels of a certain time, and how Adichie is an icon who sits between two eras. Feminist icon to pop culture artefact? Dream Count is as much a book as it is a publishing event. In the years between her previous novel, Americanah – a book so successful that it has made the New York Times’s list of the best fiction of the 21st century – and her latest offering, Adichie became a cultural figurehead. Dream Count returns to the themes that Adichie is in greatest command of: an existence that sits between living in Africa and living in the diaspora. The Covid pandemic acts as a backdrop to the lives of four female protagonists, and between them there are the roiling affairs of the heart, disappointments and assaults and bodily wreckage whose collective toll starts to be felt, or “counted”, in middle age. The central figure is modelled on Nafissatou Diallo, who was allegedly assaulted in 2011 in a hotel room by the French economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn. It is a “gesture of returned dignity”, Adichie says in her author’s note. But it is also an example of how the author always leans into the sharp and jagged realities of womanhood, with no desire to smooth its edges. Adichie is, above all, a a matter-of-fact narrator of bodily ravages: bad sex, small penises, postpartum injuries, fibroids and heavy bleeding. This is my favourite quality of Adichie’s. She doesn’t traffic in banalities or idealisation of Black women as poetically and magically tragic or noble. They just are. In Dream Count, Adichie’s style is as confident and singular as ever. Almost too much so. Her strong voice inserts itself into the mouths of her protagonists, who sometimes pronounce things that only she writes, rather than what regular people say: “Each day with Chuka,” one character narrates, “I encountered his otherness.” Ultimately, the reader always feels in safe hands. This novel is about intersecting female relationships in a female universe of voices and points of view, and there is something cosy and mutually affirming in that. Yet it also feels artificial (which is the writer’s prerogative, after all, to construct their narrative world), as if these characters were performing some grand allegory of a woman’s arc. I found myself thinking: just let them speak! Just let me embrace these women you have so tenderly portrayed. Which brings me to my main sense of the book: it felt like a series of set pieces, rather than a coherent work of fiction; an extended commentary on gender relations and societal expectations of women. I didn’t feel carried along, more an audience to strong but disconnected accounts and introspections. There is something in this that may be related to the moment that transformed Adichie from a literary sensation to a pop culture behemoth. Her book-length essay We Should All Be Feminists, a landmark treatise on, well, why we should all be feminists, became a totem of a particular era of mid-00s trends. It was the time of Lean In and Girl Bosses and a broader fourth-wave feminism that revived the movement through online activism, #MeToo, and women’s marches. Audio excerpts from Adichie’s Ted Talk on feminism were picked up by Beyoncé and featured in her 2013 hit Flawless. Dior designed T-shirts with “We should all be feminists” printed on them. It was a weird time. Adichie was a perfect icon for that moment: strident, smart but also glamorous – marrying liberal progressive politics on gender with accessibility. She became the face of the beauty brand No 7, was on Vanity Fair’s best-dressed list, and embraced fashion and beauty as a rebuke to those who see them as somehow diminishing women’s intellect. Adichie distanced herself from Beyoncé’s version of feminism in particular, “as it is the kind that … gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men”, she said. But there is an echo of that time and its ensuing discourses in Dream Count, even as she tries to transcend it. Men are not the protagonists but are still somehow centred, even if we roll to a conclusion that perhaps they are not necessary. And there are on-the-nose statements where Adichie ventriloquises through characters that tone of clapback feminism. “Dear men,” writes one of her characters in her blog where she dispenses satirical advice to men, “I understand that you don’t like abortion, but the best way to reduce abortion is if you take responsibility for where your male bodily fluids go.” There are also jarringly cartoonish portrayals of American, or Americanised, characters opining, which I interpreted as a jab at the smugness of “woke” progressives, a cohort I suppose Adichie would like to distance herself from. The overarching feeling was of a book that was smaller than its writer. Adichie, as a talent, remains sharp and masterly, but as a social and political commentator, she sounds stranded. Perhaps one of the dangers of being an icon is the risk of one day becoming an artefact. • To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday, please subscribe here.","2025-08-20T11:39:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/aug/19/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author-dream-count-writer"
"abortion","Trump is using his assault on government to retaliate against women","Last week, a federal judge blocked the justice department from canceling $3.2m in federal grants to the American Bar Association (ABA). The court agreed with the ABA’s claim that the administration was retaliating against it for taking public stances against Donald Trump. But how had the US president retaliated? Which grants had he clawed back? Those supporting programs that train lawyers to defend victims of domestic and sexual violence. It was just one of Trump’s many acts of aggression against perceived enemies that just happen to – or quite deliberately – target women. During the 2016 presidential campaign, after the release of the “grab ’em by the pussy” tape, Vox’s Libby Nelson noted that there was something fundamentally different about Trump’s sexism from the sexism of his predecessors. “Usually, the critique of Republican candidates has been based on policy – healthcare access and abortion rights – or on attitudes heavily influenced by religion,” she wrote. But “Trump’s anti-feminism owes more to the gleeful vulgarity and implicit threats of violence of 4chan than the traditional debate over what a woman’s role should be in the public square.” Trump II is both a personal and a political misogynist – a chimera with the soul of a snake and the brains of a policy wonk, transplanted from the authors of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The widest target of Trump’s aggression is the universe of people capable of having babies. Four days after the inauguration, his administration directed the justice department’s civil rights division to cease enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act, which prohibits harassment or blockage of patients entering abortion clinics. His administration dismissed three ongoing cases, pardoned 23 convicted violators of the law, and limited future prosecutions to “cases presenting significant aggravating factors, such as death, serious bodily harm, or serious property damage”. In March, he began withholding tens of millions of dollars from Title X, the only federal program supporting reproductive healthcare. The move was not explicitly anti-abortion – the Hyde Amendment banned federal funding for abortion 50 years ago – but it was surely aimed at pleasing religious fundamentalists who oppose all interference with “natural” baby-making. Lots of providers, including some Planned Parenthood affiliates, immediately collapsed, leaving millions of people with no family planning, cancer screening or prenatal services. Now, having failed repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood through legislation, Republicans are trying to hide the dirty deed in the budget. And like much of the “waste, fraud, and abuse” targeted by the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), these cuts would cost taxpayers far more than they would save: according to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost will be $300m over the next 10 years in unwanted births and shifts of reproductive services to other providers. Trump isn’t sparing mothers who want to be mothers, either. A week ago, funding to study maternal mortality was rescinded and most of the workers who monitor and improve maternal and child health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were placed on leave. The cuts came just after researchers at the National Institutes of Health published a paper documenting a huge rise in mothers’ deaths in childbirth or within a year afterward, most notably among Native American and Black women; the authors urged the government to make combatting these deaths “an urgent public health priority”. Where women’s bodies are now subject to harm by intentional neglect, they will also be more vulnerable to harm by violence. Before his inauguration, Trump called for the execution of rapists. A few months later, the justice department suspended grant applications from non-profits providing emergency shelter, legal assistance and crisis services to victims of domestic and sexual violence under the Violence Against Women Act. The agencies were caught promoting “woke” agendas – evident from the word “gender”, as in “gender-based violence”, in their mission statements. The grant program appears to be back up on the justice department website, but no one knows for how long. In late April, the administration zeroed out all funding for training, auditing, data collection and victim support under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), which Congress passed unanimously in 2003. Prea does not protect migrants in detention, but the Department of Homeland Security was nevertheless subject to oversight, and that included investigating sexual abuse by Ice employees. Not any more. In spite of thousands of complaints of sexual violence against detained women and children, the Trump administration closed the department’s three watchdog agencies, including the offices through which detainees could lodge complaints. As part of its elimination of anything suggestive of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), the administration halted the military’s sexual assault prevention training. The defense department reported in 2023 that nearly a quarter of active-duty women were subject to sexual harassment – and they are just the ones who risked coming forward. The policies that smash the legal bulwarks against sexual violence and those that put pregnant people’s lives at risk make for the most compelling subject lines on fundraising emails from advocates for women, people of color and other legally protected classes hardest. But the disproportionate harm these folks are suffering from the decimation of the federal workforce by Doge is possibly most consequential, because it may not be reversible. Women and Black people are more likely to work in government jobs than in the private sector; a recent McKinsey analysis found that women, particularly women of color, are promoted at higher rates in public institutions than in private corporations. But government jobs also provide union representation, job security, pensions and other benefits that lift people of color into the middle class and allow them to accumulate the property and wealth denied them since slavery – benefits that do not accrue to home health aides, chambermaids and workers in the other low-paid, precarious occupations where women and people of color predominate. “For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” vowed candidate Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference early in 2023. But it is Trump himself who feels most wronged and betrayed, with women – the pussy-hatted protesters who overran Washington on the second day of his first administration, the sex worker Stormy Daniels, who publicly poked fun at his self-celebrated endowment, the magazine writer E Jean Carroll, awarded tens of millions of dollars in damages for his sexual assault and defamation – perhaps the greatest wrongdoers and traitors. Even Melania is no longer pretending to like him. Like his woman-hating followers, this man, who has used his wealth and his body to impose his will on women, feels sorely victimized by them. Now he has more power than any other man in the world to exact his revenge. Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five books.

"abortion","Arizona’s Republican-led house repeals strict abortion ban – as it happened","The supreme court heard from both sides in a dispute between the Biden administration and Idaho over whether federal law requires doctors in the state, where a strict abortion ban is in effect, to perform the procedure on women in emergency circumstances. The court’s three liberal justices were skeptical towards Republican-governed Idaho, as were some members of the conservative majority, but it is unclear if they will ultimately find against the state. A decision is expected in June, which could again raise the public’s awareness of the impacts of Roe v Wade’s downfall, just months before the November presidential election. Here’s what else happened today: Arizona’s house passed legislation to repeal its near-total abortion ban, after three Republicans joined with all Democrats in the chamber. It now heads to the state senate, where it is set to be voted on next week. Joe Biden signed the $95b foreign aid bill passed by the Senate yesterday into law. It approves further military assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and threatens social media app TikTok with a nationwide ban unless its Chinese owner sells it in a year. The White House’s campaign against junk fees continued, with the transportation department debuting new regulations against hidden charges, and requirements that passengers receive automatic refunds in certain cases. The defense department announced a $1b weapons shipment to Ukraine shortly after the aid bill was signed that president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said would help them defend against Russia’s attacks. TikTok is in trouble in the US. The just-signed foreign aid bill requires its owner, Chinese firm ByteDance, to sell the popular social media app in a year, or be banned nationwide. The Associated Press reports that the Arizona house finally passed a bill repealing its near-total abortion ban after three Republicans voted to advance the measure alongside all 29 Democrats in the chamber. Previous attempts to pass the bill had failed for a lack of votes by Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the house. The divide in the Senate is similar small, with Republicans in the majority with 16 seats, and Democrats with 14. Arizona’s state senate Democrats say the bill repealing the state’s abortion ban will be voted on 1 May: Arizona lawmakers took a step towards repealing the strict, century-and-a-half old abortion ban that was set to go into effect due to a court decision earlier this month, Reuters reports, with the state house just now voting to repeal the law. However, the state senate must approve the repeal before it comes into effect. Republican candidates who are hoping to win one of the swing state’s US Senate seat in November and its electoral votes for Donald Trump had denounced the revived near-total ban and asked the state legislature to repeal it, but previous efforts fell short in recent weeks. Here’s more on the saga: This post has been corrected to say the ban was set to go into effect, and was not currently in effect. When it heard oral arguments earlier today over whether a federal law known as Emtala requires Idaho, a state with strict abortion ban, to allow the procedure in emergencies, the supreme court’s justices appeared split into three camps. The court’s three-justice liberal minority was sympathetic to the Biden administration, which has championed reproductive health access and sued Idaho over its law. Of the court’s six-justice conservative supermajority, three – Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – seemed partial to Idaho’s insistence that it had the authority to dramatically narrow when doctors may perform abortions, even during emergencies. The other three conservative justices – John Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh – asked questions that indicated they may at least be willing to consider the Biden administration’s positions. The latter two justices had voted in 2022 to overturn Roe v Wade, setting the stage for Republican-led states to ban or restrict the procedure. From the Guardian’s Carter Sherman, here’s a recap of arguments in the case, which will likely be decided in June – less than five months before a presidential election where abortion access is expected to be a key issue for voters: Progressive group Indivisible hit out at the supreme court’s conservatives after they earlier today heard oral arguments in a dispute between the White House and Idaho over whether the conservative state’s abortion ban can prevent doctors from performing the procedure in an emergency. The Biden administration argued that federal law requires abortion be performed in emergencies, an argument that the court’s three liberal justices appeared to agree with. But the six justices who form its conservative supermajority appeared either skeptical, or unsure of how they may rule. In a statement, Indivisible’s managing director Mari Urbina linked the court’s stance on the case to Donald Trump’s appointment of three of the justices who make up its conservative bloc: We must stress unequivocally: this case has no business being decided by these MAGA Supreme Court justices. Their decision to hear it and put the law into effect is a calculated move, aligned with their deeply misogynistic, twisted, anti-women MAGA agenda. It’s a known fact, yet it remains profoundly disturbing that our fundamental rights—our very bodies and lives—are controlled by these MAGA, Trump-selected extremists. Justice Alito’s remark that a woman is ‘an individual’ painfully exposes the core of their ideology. The fact that Republicans need to assert that women are indeed human beings blatantly reveals the depravity of their values and political agenda. That last part is a dig justice Samuel Alito, a conservative stalwart who was appointed by George W Bush. A billionaire TikTok investor has been linked to $16m in donations to anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups, a new investigation has found. Eli Clifton reports for the Guardian: Top Republican donor and TikTok investor Jeff Yass is connected to over $16m in funding to anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups that have advocated for a US war with Iran and other militaristic policies in the Middle East, according to an investigation by the Guardian and Responsible Statecraft. Media reports on Yass, the billionaire co-founder of Susquehanna International Group, a trading and technology firm, have focused on his outsized role in the Republican party, to which he is now the largest political donor in the 2024 election cycle, contributing more than $46m thus far. Yass has also emerged as the biggest funder of a group targeting progressive representative Summer Lee in her primary race, suggesting an interest in influencing Democratic primary outcomes, not just in boosting Republicans. For the full story, click here: The transportation department has issued a new set of rules to protect passengers from hidden airline fees. In a video address on Wednesday, transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said: “The Biden-Harris administration is now going to require airlines to give passengers an automatic cash refund if your flight is cancelled or significantly delayed, and you’ll get your fee refunded if your bag doesn’t arrive in time or if you don’t get a service that you paid for like wifi. No more refund runarounds and no defaulting to a travel credit that expires. We’re also eliminating hidden fees.” Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democrat who ran for president in 2020, has repeated a false claim about Hillary Clinton and “grooming” in a new book. The Guardian’s Martin Pengelly reports: Accusing Democrats of making up “a conspiracy theory that [Trump] was ‘colluding’ with the Russians to win the election” in 2016, Gabbard claims: “Hillary Clinton used a similar tactic against me when I ran for president in 2020, accusing me of being ‘groomed by the Russians’.” Gabbard ran for the Democratic nomination. Clinton did not accuse her of being “groomed by the Russians”. What Clinton said, in October 2019 and on a podcast hosted by the former Barack Obama adviser David Plouffe, was that she thought Republicans would encourage a third-party bid in 2020, aiming to syphon votes from the Democratic candidate in key states as Jill Stein, the Green candidate, and the Libertarian, Gary Johnson, did four years before.

The defense department announced a $1b weapons shipment to Ukraine shortly after the aid bill was signed that president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said would help them defend against Russia’s attacks. The legislation just signed by Joe Biden will also force ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell the popular social media app within a year or face a ban in the United States. Here’s more on what happens next, from the Guardian’s Dan Milmo: Joe Biden has signed into law a bill that requires TikTok’s Chinese owner to sell the social media app’s US operations or face a ban, after the Senate passed the legislation. The law, part of a foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, sets the clock ticking on a potential ban for a platform that is hugely popular in the US. Here is a guide to the TikTok legislation and what might happen next. As Joe Biden signed the foreign aid bill this morning, the defense department announced that it would ship $1b of new weapons and ammunition to Ukraine amid fears Russia’s military will soon overrun more territory. Some of what the defense department says it sent: RIM-7 and AIM-9M missiles for air defense; Stinger anti-aircraft missiles; Small arms and additional rounds of small arms ammunition, including .50 caliber rounds to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS); Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm artillery rounds, including High Explosive and Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions rounds; 105mm artillery rounds; 60mm mortar rounds; Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles; Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs); High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs); Logistics support vehicles; Tactical vehicles to tow and haul equipment; Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles In response, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was “gaining the support we need to continue protecting lives from Russian attacks”: Joe Biden this morning signed the $95b bill Congress passed yesterday that authorized further military aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and will see social media app TikTok banned nationwide in a year unless its owner ByteDance divests. The White House released a video showing the moment Biden transformed the bill into a law: The Senate’s overwhelming passage of the legislation yesterday capped months of congressional wrangling that at one point saw Democrats ready to swallow strict immigration regulations demanded by the GOP, until Donald Trump emerged to torpedo the deal. Here’s a recap of how we got here, and what the bill may mean for Washington’s allies: Beyond the supreme court, state legislatures have become important arenas for determining where abortion can be accessed, and where it cannot. Today in Arizona, Democrats will once again try to repeal the state’s near-total abortion ban, after Republicans narrowly blocked previous efforts: Democrats at the Arizona legislature are attempting to repeal the state’s near-total ban on abortions for a third straight week, again spotlighting an issue that has put Republicans on the defensive in a battleground state for the presidential election. The Arizona supreme court earlier this month concluded the state can enforce a long-dormant law that permits abortions only to save the pregnant patient’s life. The ruling suggested doctors could be prosecuted under the law first approved in 1864, and anyone who assists in an abortion could face two to five years in prison. The ruling put enormous pressure on Republicans in the state, who on the one hand are under intense pressure from some conservatives in their base who firmly support the abortion ban, and from swing voters who strongly oppose the measure and will decide crucial races including the presidency, the US Senate and the GOP’s control of the legislature. Some prominent Republicans, including the GOP candidate for Senate, Kari Lake, have come out against the ban. But Republicans in the statehouse so far have blocked efforts by Democratic lawmakers to repeal the law. The supreme court has wrapped up hearing the arguments in the case pitting Idaho against the Biden administration over whether states with strict abortion bans must allow the procedures in emergencies under the federal law Emtala. But before arguments concluded, Idaho’s deputy solicitor Josh Turner rose to rebut arguments made by Elizabeth Prelogar, the US solicitor general. He warned that the conflict between state and federal law at issue in this case will return to the court because other states have strict abortion laws like Idaho, and their definitions of emergency situations where abortions can be performed are narrower than Emtala: The administration’s position ultimately is untethered from any limiting principle. There’s just no way to limit this to abortion, and there’s no way to limit it to Idaho. There are 22 states with abortion laws on the books. This isn’t going to end with Idaho, it’s not going to end with the six states that general Prelogar mentioned because all of the states that have abortion regulations define the health and the emergency exception narrower than Emtala does. So this question is going to come up in state after state after state. US solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar pushed back against Idaho’s claim that their abortion ban does not conflict with the requirements of Emtala. Under Emtala, hospitals are required to stabilize the health of patients who show up in the midst of medical emergencies. But under Idaho’s ban, abortions are only permitted if a woman’s life is at risk – a much higher threshold. Prelogar called the argument that Idaho’s abortion ban and Emtala can coexist “gravely mistaken”. “It’s inconsistent with the actual text of the Idaho law, it’s inconsistent with medical reality and it’s inconsistent with what’s happening on the ground,” Prelogar said. Under Idaho’s ban, she continued, “Doctors have to shut their eyes to everything except death. But under Emtala, you’re supposed to be thinking about: is she about to lose her fertility?’” Moreover, she said, doctors and pregnant patients in Idaho – whose full abortion ban is currently in effect – are in reality not getting the care they are entitled to under Emtala. “Women in Idaho today are not getting treatment,” Prelogar said. “They are getting airlifted out of the state.” The three liberal justices have all expressed skepticism towards Idaho’s argument against Emtala, the federal law that the Biden administration believes preempts strict state abortion bans. Idaho was also in for some skeptical questions from Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who was among the justices that overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Oral arguments only provide a hint of how the justices may ultimately rule, and in order for Idaho to lose, it would need five votes against it. Should Barrett band together with the liberals, who might be the fifth? A candidate for that place could be John Roberts, the chief justice and a conservative, but one who has occasionally acted as the court’s swing vote in recent years. In an exchange with US solicitor general Elizabeth Pelogar, he asked her to address the scenario of how Emtala would handle a hospital where all the doctors cited conscience objections to abstain from performing an emergency abortion. “If the question is, could you force an individual doctor to step in, then, over a conscience objection, the answer is no … the question is whether or not they must have available someone who can comply with the procedures required by Emtala and what would be the consequence if they didn’t? Would it be eventual termination of their participation in Medicare?” asked Roberts, referring to the federal health insurance program that many hospitals participate in. “That’s right,” replied Prelogar. “If a hospital was continually disobeying the requirement to have in place sufficient personnel to run their emergency room, then I imagine that (the US department of health and human services) enforcement action would work with that hospital to try to bring it into compliance, and if the hospital ultimately is just leaving itself in a position where it can never provide care, then it would terminate the Medicare funding agreement.” When the court rules, we may find out if that answer was enough to assuage Roberts’s concerns. US solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar pushed back against Idaho’s claim that a mental health emergency could necessitate an abortion under Emtala, a federal law that requires hospitals to stabilize patients in medical emergencies. “There can be grave mental health emergencies, but Emtala could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care,” Prelogar said. “Why?” justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, interrupted. “Here’s why,” Prelogar responded. “It’s because that wouldn’t do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that’s causing the mental health emergency in the first place. This is not about mental health. Generally, this is about treatment by ER doctors in the emergency room. And when a woman comes in with some great mental health emergency, if she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy – she might not be in a position to give any informed consent. Instead, the way you treat mental health emergency is to address what’s happening in the brain. If you’re having a psychotic episode, you administer antipsychotics.” Prelogar later emphasized that in the Biden administration’s view, Emtala’s protections would never extend to abortions for people in mental health crises. Earlier in the arguments, some of the conservative justices expressed confusion over whether Idaho’s ban conflicts with the federal law Emtala, which requires hospitals to stabilize patients facing medical emergencies. “Is there any condition you’re aware of where the solicitor general says Emtala requires an abortion be available under an emergency circumstance where Idaho law says there is not?” asked justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative. Yes, if someone wanted an abortion because of a mental health condition, replied Idaho deputy solicitor Josh Turner. Kavanaugh seemed to move past Turner’s claim, indicating that the justices had not been briefed enough on that particular topic. But it struck his fellow conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett. If that’s the only daylight between Idaho’s ban and Emtala, she asked Turner: “Why are you here?” Although Turner seemed to waver during oral arguments, Idaho has argued in court papers that its abortion ban does align with Emtala. Anti-abortion activists across the country have been making a similar argument: abortion bans do not preclude people from getting medically necessary abortions, and so they don’t need to be amended to further protect people in emergencies. Doctors and patients say that, in reality, the exceptions written into abortion bans are so vague that they are unworkable. Dozens of women have launched lawsuits, including in a separate case in Idaho, saying that they were denied medically necessary abortions. Roughly 50 Idaho doctors have also left the state rather than try to navigate an abortion ban that carries a hefty criminal penalty for violations. The supreme court is now hearing from US solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar, who is asking the justices to allow federal law Emtala to require Idaho and other states with strict abortion restrictions to perform the procedure in cases of emergencies. “Today, doctors in Idaho and the woman in Idaho are in an impossible position. If a woman comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn’t yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to materially deteriorate, or they’re airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs,” said Prelogar, who represents the Biden administration. She continued: One hospital system in Idaho says that right now, it’s having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That’s untenable, and Emtala does not countenance it. None of petitioners’ interpretations fit with the text, and so they try to make this case be about the broader debate for access to abortion in cases of unwanted pregnancy. But that’s not what this case is about at all. Idaho’s ban on abortion is enforceable in virtually all of its applications. But in the narrow circumstances involving grave medical emergencies, Idaho cannot criminalize the essential care that Emtala requires. If the justices side with Idaho, Americans could be left with a federal emergency medicine law that is open to exempting disfavored people, conditions and treatments – for example emergencies involving people addicted to opioids, Aids-related emergencies or treatment for gender dysphoria. Idaho’s quest to exert total control over abortion could also, in the long term, establish legal theory that undermines the federal government’s broader ability to regulate healthcare, the same way exempting the so-called abortion pill, mifepristone, from Food and Drug Administration analysis, would undermine drug regulation. Both cases are about abortion on their face, but the legal theories underpinning them could have extraordinarily broad implications for the health of all Americans. The supreme court’s four female justices, including conservative Amy Coney Barrett, seemed taken aback by the claim by Idaho’s deputy solicitor general, Josh Turner, that a doctor could be prosecuted for performing an abortion in order to protect a woman’s health, rather than her life. Idaho’s abortion ban only permits abortions in medical emergencies if a woman’s life is at stake. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, read off a list of real-life cases where women had their abortions delayed in medical emergencies. The problem with bans like Idaho’s, doctors say, is that doctors are forced to wait and watch until patients get so sick that their life is at risk – rather than intervening as soon as a health issue emerges. After the story of one woman, who Sotomayor said lost her baby and was forced into a hysterectomy, the justice asked if, under Idaho’s law: “You’re telling me the doctor there couldn’t have done the abortion earlier?” “It goes back to whether a doctor can in good-faith medical judgment – ” Turner started to say. “That’s a lot for a doctor to risk,” Sotomayor interrupted. If a doctor violates Idaho’s abortion ban, they can face up to five years in prison. Turner tried to insist that a doctor operating in good faith would not be prosecuted under the Idaho state legislature’s interpretation of its abortion ban. Coney Barrett asked: “What if the prosecutor thought differently?” “That is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,” Turner replied. The case that the justices are hearing right now, which deals with whether federal law protects hospitals’ ability to offer medically necessary abortions, turns on an oft-overlooked nuance in abortion law: the difference between an abortion that may protect a woman’s health versus one that may save her life. All US abortion bans technically allow abortions in medical emergencies. But seven states, including Idaho, have bans on the books that say that the patient’s life has to be at risk — a higher standard than bans that allow for abortions when a patient’s health is in jeopardy. The Biden administration sued Idaho over its ban, arguing that it conflicts with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or Emtala. Emtala requires hospitals to stabilize patients’ health when they are facing medical emergencies, including — in the Biden administration’s view — in cases where patients need abortions. If an Idaho doctor performs a “health-saving” abortion, they could run afoul of Idaho’s ban — but if they don’t, they could violate Emtala. “Her life is not in peril but she’s going to lose her reproductive organs … unless an abortion takes place,” said Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal. “Now, that’s the category of cases where Emtala says: ‘My gosh, of course an abortion is necessary.’ “And yet Idaho says: ‘Sorry, no abortion here.’ And the result is these patients are now helicoptered out of state,” Kagan continued. The problem with abortion bans, doctors say, is that it is not always clear when a patient’s life is at risk. And if doctors know that a pregnant patient’s condition may worsen, they want to help her – not wait until she’s on the brink of death. Fellow liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor proceeded to read off a list of real-life cases where women’s abortions were delayed due to abortion bans, including the case of a woman who was ultimately forced to have a hysterectomy. Idaho’s attorney Josh Turner argued that Emtala cannot override the state’s law to require medical treatment in contravention of its abortion ban. He immediately received pushback from the court’s three liberal justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. “The problem we’re having right now is that you’re sort of putting preemption on its head. The whole purpose of preemption is to say that if the state passes a that violates federal law, the state law is no longer effective,” said Sotomayor. “If objective medical care requires you to treat women who are, who present the potential of serious medical complications, and the abortion is the only thing that can print them and that you have to do it.” The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, better known to hospitals administrators nationally as Emtala, requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients regardless of their ability to pay. The act is among Americans’ only universal federal rights to healthcare – one propelled into law by stories of private hospitals’ “dumping” patients who could not pay, including women in active labor, at public hospitals. This law could be left in tatters if justices side with anti-abortion states, represented by Idaho. Emtala requires doctors to treat patients if they face a serious risk to health, treatment that includes exceedingly rare emergency room abortions, the Biden administration argues. Idaho’s state law is in direct conflict with this federal right to health, because it only allows doctors to intervene with an abortion if a woman is about to die. On the one hand, Emtala can levy serious penalties against providers and hospitals if doctors do not treat women. On the other, doctors could serve jail time or lose their license if they violate Idaho’s law. The arguments begin with opening statements from Josh Turner, Idaho’s constitutional litigation and policy chief. He argued that the Biden administration is interpreting Emtala – the federal law that the White House argue requires hospitals to perform abortion in emergencies, even when that runs afoul of state law – too broadly. “Everyone understands that licensing laws limit medical practice. That’s why a nurse isn’t available to perform open heart surgery, no matter the need, no matter her knowledge,” he said. “The answer doesn’t change just because we’re talking about abortion. The court should reject the administration’s unlimited reading of Emtala and reverse the district court’s judgment.” The supreme court has convened to hear a case from Idaho challenging the Biden administration’s requirement that federally funded hospitals carry out abortions in emergencies. Follow along here as we cover it live. The supreme court is about to hear arguments over whether federal law can require hospitals in states with abortion bans to perform medically necessary abortions. The case originated in Idaho, which only permits abortions in medical emergencies if a patient’s life is at risk. The Biden administration has sued Idaho, claiming that Idaho’s stringent ban violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act – known as Emtala. Idaho is expected to argue that its ban doesn’t conflict with Emtala, because Emtala does not mention abortion and cannot compel doctors to perform procedures that are illegal under Idaho law. The case marks the second time this year that the supreme court, where the six conservative justices outnumber the three liberals, and which overturned Roe v Wade less than two years ago, has dealt with abortion rights. Last month, the justices also heard arguments in a case that deals with the availability of a common abortion pill. A decision in the case is expected in June. As the supreme court prepares to weigh whether Idaho’s abortion ban conflicts with the Biden administration’s insistence that federally funded hospitals carry out emergency abortions, protesters representing both sides of the debate are gathering outside: Good morning, US politics blog readers. The issue of abortion will once again be before the supreme court this morning, and the conservative justices who two years ago upended the country’s politics by voting to overturn Roe v Wade and allow states to ban abortions. In response to that decision, Joe Biden said that even states where the procedure is banned must still allow hospitals that receive federal funds to perform the procedure in an emergency, citing a 1986 law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or Emtala. Today’s legal tussle involves the deeply conservative state of Idaho, where abortion is prohibited unless a patient’s life is at risk in an emergency. The Biden administration sued the state, arguing that its law clashed with Emtala, and the justices now have to sort out the dispute. The supreme court is dominated by a supermajority of six conservative justices against three liberals, but since dismantling Roe, they haven’t necessarily shown the same zeal for other efforts to further restrict abortion. About a month ago, the justices appeared skeptical of attempts by anti-abortion doctors to roll back the availability of mifepristone, a drug used nationwide in medication abortions. Today’s hearing begins at 10am ET, and we’ll be listening to the arguments for a sense of how they are leaning on this issue. Here’s what else we are watching today: Biden is expected to sign a bill approved by the Senate last night that authorizes $95b in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, capping months of congressional wrangling over the contentious issue. The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, is heading to Columbia University, which has been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests in recent days and police arrests of demonstrators.

"abortion","US state abortion ban exemptions aren’t vague by accident. Uncertainty is the point","Anyone who has lived under the control of an abusive partner or parent knows that the problem is not just what’s prohibited. It’s what you’re unsure is prohibited. The prospect of punishment instills fear. Vagueness about what will be punished promotes caution. Just in case, the teenager doesn’t hang out with certain friends. The teacher deletes the controversial book from the curriculum. The doctor decides not to perform an abortion when the patient’s health or life is at risk, but, maybe, not imminently so. This is what is happening across the 21 states that have banned abortion in all but the direst of circumstances. It’s what happened to Amanda Zurawski, an Austin, Texas, resident who learned at 18 weeks’ gestation that her cervix was prematurely dilated, spelling certain death for her fetus, already named Willow, and posing a grave threat to her own health. But because there was still fetal cardiac activity, the doctors sent Zurawski home to get sick enough to qualify for an abortion under Texas’s ban. The law permits the procedure only when a patient would otherwise lose “major bodily function” or die. It doesn’t say when that might be. And it makes no allowance for a fatal fetal anomaly. Zurawski went into sepsis – full-body infection – and spent three days in the ICU. She survived, but it’s unlikely that her fertility did. In Zurawski v Texas (2023), the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) argued on behalf of two doctors and 20 patients that Texas’s statute was so vaguely written that providers could not know whether they were breaking the law – risking penalties as severe as imprisonment – if they did the medically correct thing. The CRR called this failure a violation of the women’s constitutional right to life. In December 2023, a lower court judge enjoined the law awaiting further clarification and permitted abortion if the doctor’s “good-faith judgment” deemed it necessary. Ken Paxton, Texas’s fanatically anti-choice attorney general, appealed the injunction to the Texas supreme court. And last week that court removed the injunction, ruling that the law is perfectly clear. The Human Life Protection Act “permits a physician to intervene to address a woman’s life-threatening physical condition before death or serious physical impairment are imminent”, wrote Justice Jane Bland. “A physician who tells a patient, ‘Your life is threatened by a complication that has arisen during your pregnancy, and you may die, or there is a serious risk you will suffer substantial physical impairment unless an abortion is performed,’ and in the same breath states ‘but the law won’t allow me to provide an abortion in these circumstances’ is simply wrong in that legal assessment.” In other words, if the patient is harmed, it is the doctor’s fault, not the law’s. Zurawski v Texas was the first lawsuit to challenge a ban on behalf of women with complicated pregnancies since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022. There are certain to be more. At the 4 June hearing of the Democrat-led Senate committee on health, education, labor, and pensions, witnesses gave evidence of what the committee called a national “healthcare nightmare” caused by the bans and the confusion they’re wreaking. In a few places, such as Tennessee, elected officials have suggested that legislators amend the laws to make them easier to understand. But few such proposals have been filed. In its lawsuit, the CRR asked Texas to tighten the statute. But the justices did not, and did not instruct the legislature to do so. “We are right back where we started,” said an incensed Zurawski. They may be even further back than that. At a virtual hearing 10 days before the ruling, members of the Texas medical board argued with lawyers and healthcare providers – and with each other – over interpretations of its guidance written to clear up ambiguities in the law. But all the new guidelines did was add a requirement that providers submit profuse documentation justifying their decisions. After the five-hour hearing and hundreds of written comments, everyone agreed on one thing: the irresolution is now worse. Why don’t lawmakers clarify their statutes? For one thing, they can’t. Most of them wouldn’t know a fallopian tube from a brake fluid line, and even if they did, there’s no way to codify everything that can possibly go wrong in a problem pregnancy or every medical decision that must be made in response. The Texas court said the doctor who opts against an emergency abortion makes the wrong legal assessment. But if most legislators are not doctors, few doctors are also lawyers. Yet the CRR’s attempt to push the state to amend a bad law to make it a little less bad is the same tactic that the pro-choice legal establishment pursued throughout the Roe years – and look where that got us. The tactic is not just counterproductive. It’s delusional. The laws’ vagueness is not an oversight, not the result of sloppy or ignorant drafting. Vagueness is the intention. Along with police, prosecutors and civilian vigilantes enforcing the laws, the states are counting on self-policing. They may even hope that providers do less than they are legally permitted. And if bad things happen – “painful” as that might be, admitted Bland – the state can duck the blame.

"abortion","‘Guys go where their buddies are’: the young men recruiting each other to fight for abortion rights","“Oh, no, no, I think you’re trying to get in contact with my wife.” That’s what a man in Florida recently told an activist who knocked on his door to talk about abortion rights. But the man was wrong. The activist, who represented a group called Men4Choice, was there to talk to him, because the group is dedicated to getting more men who support abortion rights involved in the fight for them. “They have to get off the sidelines,” said Dewayne Martin, the youth organizing director for Men4Choice, who relayed the activist’s account to the Guardian. “They have to become the foot soldiers of this movement.” Two years after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and allowed more than a dozen states to ban almost all abortions, most men in the United States support abortion rights. Within months of the decision, 65% of men between the ages of 18 and 29 said they supported abortion being legal in all or most cases. But Men4Choice calls these young men “passively pro-choice”. Young women still support abortion rights at higher rates than their male peers – and young men are just not as motivated to take a public stand on the issue. Just 43% of gen Z men say that abortion rights are a “critical issue”, compared with 68% of gen Z women, the political scientist Melissa Deckman found in her forthcoming book The Politics of Gen Z. This indifference has consequences: compared with women, men between the ages of 18 and 44 are less likely to say that abortion is motivating them to vote in the 2024 elections, according to polling from the firm PerryUndem. They are also less likely to say that the state of abortion rights will affect whom they vote for. Men4Choice’s goal is to get these young men to vote, canvass and otherwise act on their beliefs – instead of leaving the work to women. “When we think about our organizing strategy, it’s: help men see the harm,” said Oren Jacobson, a Men4Choice co-founder. “Help men understand how this issue is not just a woman’s issue. It’s not just about abortion. It’s about freedom, it’s about power, it’s about control. It is an issue that impacts all of us, our families, our loved ones.” It affects young men’s futures, too. Compared with young men whose partners got pregnant and gave birth, young men whose partners had abortions are almost four times more likely to graduate college. Young men who have been involved in an abortion are also more likely to make more money than those whose partners gave birth. Overall, an estimated one in five men has impregnated somebody who has had an abortion. Democrats have made abortion rights one of their central issues in the 2024 elections, while Republicans – wary of how outrage over Roe’s downfall probably lost them a much heralded “red wave” in the 2022 midterms – have tried to downplay the issue and their own role in overturning Roe. However, as they’ve backed away, rightwing commentators and politicians have become far more adept at discussing masculinity than their leftwing counterparts, experts have told the Guardian. These rightwing public figures are not only willing to acknowledge that young men are struggling – with getting into college, with their finances, with their mental health – but also to portray these struggles as the result of women’s growing social and political power. This kind of talk – which is so popular it has essentially spawned a cottage industry – is believed to be a major reason why, despite their past support for liberal causes, so many young men are now pivoting towards conservatism (and potentially towards supporting Donald Trump). “It feels good. It’s telling men: ‘You’re the priority. You’re the superior being,’” said Davan’te Jennings, a Men4Choice fellow who lives in Georgia. “‘You act like this, this is when you get all the cars, the women, the mansion. Grind 24/7. Don’t think about mental health. Depression isn’t real.’” In Jennings’ view, such “toxic masculinity” is part of the reason why young men don’t feel like they can be openly passionate about abortion rights. He hears references to it all the time: when Jennings talks to men through Men4Choice, the men often use phrases like “to be a man” and “the manly thing to do”. Expressing emotions – including caring about abortion rights – doesn’t fit into that mold of masculinity. Men4Choice, then, aims to reframe how abortion fits into antiquated and restrictive notions of masculinity. “Masculinity is taking action,” Martin said. “Masculinity is caring for the people that you love. Masculinity is ensuring that you are building a pathway towards freedom for you and your people, and realizing that those two things are not separate.” Christian Shephard, a 26-year-old Men4Choice fellow who serves as an organizer for the group in central Florida, tries to open up conversations about abortion rights with men by discussing how some men treat women, including how they may objectify or sexualize women. “It may sound like that has nothing to do with reproductive justice, but it certainly does,” Shephard said. “There is a clear connection between how people talk about women and how these [anti-abortion] laws are being created to deprive them of fundamental rights.” In a recent Men4Choice “community conversation” – virtual and in-person discussions where fellows are expected to bring male friends – one man claimed he didn’t have to take any responsibility for abortion because “women should keep their legs closed”, Jennings recalled. “That was literally the words he used,” Jennings said. “Most of us who are pro-choice on the call are like: ‘Now we see why it’s important to dismantle that way of thinking.’” Jacobson launched Men4Choice in 2015, but the group has exploded in the years since Roe’s demise. The Men4Choice fellowship program, which runs three times a year and is training 70 men between the ages of 18 and 28 this summer, has almost tripled in size since the summer of 2022. Many Men4Choice fellows are based in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina – all states with abortion bans. Though he was raised in a Democratic area of Miami, Martin, 22, said he hadn’t acted on his support for abortion rights until 2020. He was a high school senior working on organizing around school boards when a friend told him about Men4Choice. “It was in that moment that I realized, despite my being raised by a community of women who have served as my village and have made my life possible in several ways, I’ve never taken a direct action to support them on this issue,” recalled Martin, who became a Men4Choice fellow that year. In the months before Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, Men4Choice partnered with Doug Emhoff, Harris’s husband and the second gentleman of the United States, to host events centered on energizing men to fight for abortion rights. (“This is an issue of fairness to women. Women are dying,” Emhoff told NBC in May. “It’s affecting men’s ability to plan their lives.”) Now, the group is trying to mobilize male volunteers and funnel them towards partner organizations working on the ground. “Guys go where their buddies are,” Jacobson said. “You have to create an ecosystem of men to get them to show up.” Men4Choice is also heavily focusing on Florida, which has banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy – before many people even know they’re pregnant – and where voters will decide in November whether to amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights. Abortion-rights ballot measures previously have succeeded in Republican strongholds, such as Ohio and Kentucky. Exit polls found that 73% of male voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in favor of the Ohio measure – a significant share of voters, but still less than the 81% of young female voters who supported it. The Florida amendment must garner 60% of the vote to pass. This fall, Men4Choice wants to reach 400,000 voters through phone and text banking, according to Martin. The group also wants to hold 100 community conversations with men. There is, however, a limit to the organization’s activism. Men4Choice focuses on men who already support abortion rights or are at least open to having a discussion about it – not men who are adamantly opposed to the procedure. “If there’s not an understanding or a clear line of wanting to understand,” Jennings said, “and we’re just going to sit here and get into a debate – it’s pointless.”","2024-08-20T19:27:46Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/aug/20/abortion-rights-dobbs-men"
"abortion","PM says Australia has ‘no more important relationship’ than with Indonesia – as it happened","With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Here are the major developments from today: New South Wales women will have easier access to abortion pills after both houses passed a bill allowing nurse practitioners and registered midwives to prescribe the medication. Wages picked up a little stronger than expected at the start of 2025 to continue clawing back the purchasing power households lost from three years of high inflation. Anthony Albanese said Australia has “no more important relationship than the one we have with Indonesia” before setting off for Jakarta. Australia’s ageing coal power stations broke down 128 times during the hotter months of 2024-25, according to a report from Reliability Watch. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has confirmed one container of ballot papers for the NSW seat of Barton was temporarily misplaced during the count, with a transport officer found to have possession of the container. Macquarie Bank’s stockbroker arm is being sued by the corporate regulator, which alleges it misled the share market operator for 14 years by failing to properly report at least 73m sales, and potentially as many as 1.5bn. And the co-founder and chief executive of Cheek Media, Hannah Ferguson, announced her intention to run for the Senate at the next federal election as an independent candidate while addressing the National Press Club. Thanks for reading along – we’ll be back first thing tomorrow. Nurses and Midwives’ Association expresses support for abortion bill The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association have expressed their support for the abortion reform bill, which has allowed nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe medical abortions. Acting general secretary, Michael Whaites, said: We see this as an important change that will improve access to care. More broadly, nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives have the necessary qualifications, clinical experience, training, and lawful authority to safely prescribe and make referrals and are an under-utilised resource. This legislative change will bring NSW in line with most other states and territories, ensure the nursing and midwifery workforce is working to full scope of practice and remove barriers disadvantaging women in rural and remote areas. NSW Greens celebrate after abortion access bill passes both houses The Greens have welcomed their party’s second ever bill to pass both houses of the NSW parliament, and received support across the political spectrum, with a conscience vote for members of the Labor, Liberal and National parties. The Abortion Law Reform Amendment (Health Care Access) Bill 2025, introduced to the legislative council by the Greens’ health spokesperson, Dr Amanda Cohn, will expand access to abortion in NSW by enabling nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to prescribe abortion medication, as well as requiring additional public reporting of information about abortion access. Cohn said: The Greens are incredibly proud to have put abortion access on the political agenda and driven this needed change for women’s rights and reproductive rights in NSW. Abortion is health care and that has been re-affirmed by the parliament today. Equitable access to reproductive health care in rural NSW won’t be fixed by this bill alone. The government must fund abortion services in public hospitals, as the premier promised last year. The Greens’ spokesperson for women, Jenny Leong, who introduced the bill to the legislative assembly, said it continued the long Greens tradition of being “unapologetically pro-choice”. Nationals senator accuses Labor of not having ‘turned the corner on gender equality’ Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie has lashed out at Labor over having no “people of power who can also wear a dress” in a fiery exchange with Labor senator Marielle Smith. Speaking on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, McKenzie said Sussan Ley was an “incredibly experienced, professional politician” who would be a “great opposition leader”. This is the first time the Liberal party have had a female leader, I think we need to applaud them for that. Julie Bishop couldn’t get there. And we want to make sure that this is a successful leadership heading into the next election. She later interrupted Smith as the Labor senator was praising her party’s quotas and strong female representation, saying: I look forward to the Labor party power brokers being called “faceless women”, that’s when we know the power within the Labor party … is actually sitting with women … That’s when I know the Labor party will have actually turned the corner on gender equality, when the people who hold the power can also wear a dress. Smith said her comments were “extremely offensive”, to which McKenzie replied: “Name one power broker who is a woman” and continued: Tanya Plibersek should be leading your party. What happened to Tanya? We don’t have quotas in the National party and I don’t think we ever will. What the Liberal party does with getting more women involved is up to them. The reality is our Senate leader, Michaelia Cash, is a female, Anne Ruston is also on the leadership team, Sussan Ley, et cetera, myself, and others. (Plibersek was deputy Labor leader between 2013 and 2019.) Woman charged with attempted murder after Queensland stabbing In Queensland, a 49-year-old woman has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing a man repeatedly and contravening a domestic violence order. At about 3pm yesterday, police allege the woman stabbed the man, who was known to her, a number of times with a knife at a home in the Brisbane suburb of Banyo. Attending police applied first aid to the man and apprehended the woman upon arrival at the scene. He sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to hospital for treatment. The 49-year-old Banyo woman has been charged with one count each of attempt to murder (domestic violence offence), contravention of a domestic violence order and obstruct a police officer. She has been denied police bail and is expected to appear in Brisbane magistrates court today. PM says Australia has ‘no more important relationship’ than with Indonesia Albanese goes on to discuss his trip to Indonesia – which is his “first port of call” after being re-elected. It’s important in our own interests but also in the interests of the region that we have a strong relationship with Indonesia. That’s why when elected prime minister the first country I had a bilateral trip with was Indonesia. And this time in my second term once again I’m returning to Indonesia as the first port of call. Because there’s no more important relationship than the one we have with Indonesia. Asked about Russia’s play for an airbase in Indonesia, which drew extensive concern from Peter Dutton over the election campaign, Albanese said Indonesia had made their position “very clear”. Indonesia is a sovereign nation, but they made it very clear that the position that Mr Dutton spoke about just wasn’t the case. And the verballing of the Indonesian president is not a good idea by anyone in a senior position in Australia. The Australian can continue to report on something that isn’t happening if you wish. But the truth is, it’s not happening. And everyone senior in the Indonesian government said it wasn’t happening and I find it just a bit strange I continue to be asked about something that’s not happening. Albanese speaks to media in Perth The prime minister just fronted the media in Perth ahead of his trip to Jakarta, Indonesia. Standing behind him were elected Labor MPs in Western Australia. Anthony Albanese said he visited WA 33 times as PM in his first term, and was “starting to click over to 34 now as we go forward”. WA is so important. It’s an engine room of our national economy. It’s a growing state. The PM said he just met with the state’s premier, Roger Cook, where they discussed their “joint vision” of a future made in Australia, with WA “front and centre”. When you look at the transformation of the clean energy economy, WA is a driver of it … the capacity they have for resources, for value adding, it’s going to continue to drive the national economy. I said when I came here … that I wasn’t just about holding the seats we won in 2022, I was about building on them. And build on them we have … our members right across the board campaigned so strongly and I thank them for it … We have for the last two elections run very specific WA campaigns as separate from the national campaign, recognising that there are particular interests here. Independent abortion and contraception provider MSI Australia has welcomed the “historic moment” expanding health practitioners who can prescribe medical abortions. MSI’s medical director, Philip Goldstone, said in a statement: This an historic moment for NSW, expanding choice and improving access. We support legislative change that broadens access by enabling nurses and midwives to provide medical abortion safely and that aligns with the changes made by the TGA. The provision of medical abortion by nurses and midwives expands choice for women, making abortion care more accessible. It is particularly important for women in rural and regional areas, where there is still stigma surrounding abortion care and a limited number of doctors that provide it. We continually advocate for better access to abortion care, and have agreements in the ACT, Queensland and Western Australia to work alongside government to provide abortion care where there is inadequate public provision. Unfortunately, no such arrangements exist in NSW where public abortion provision is poorly funded or non-existent. New South Wales women will have easier access to abortion pills after both houses passed a bill allowing nurse practitioners and registered midwives to prescribe the medication. The new legislation on medical abortions brings NSW in line with other Australian states which have passed similar laws. A medical abortion involves taking prescribed abortion pills up to nine weeks’ gestation, while a surgical abortion is a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting. The vote on Greens health spokesperson Dr Amanda Cohn’s abortion amendment bill was carried in the lower house with 65 in favour and 20 opposed. The bill already passed the upper house on Thursday last week. However, it will have to return to the upper house in a few weeks’ time to be officially passed into law due to a typographical error in the bill from the upper house.

She said the Coalition over the years had been able to work together while “understanding and respecting” differences in some policy positions. We come together and we work together in what we think is in the best interests of the people we represent … I think there’s a very positive future and there will be a future of the Coalition going forward. On the Coalition’s commitment to net zero by 2050, Ruston said the most “critical issue” to solve for the government was energy bills. There’s a very, very serious issue that is right before us now, and that’s affordable reliable power. Anne Ruston says Ley leadership a ‘wonderful opportunity’ for Liberal party Still on Ley, Liberal senator Anne Ruston says her leadership is a “wonderful opportunity” for her party to “move forward and rebuild”. Appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, Ruston – a backer of Ley – described her as an “extremely capable politician” with a extensive experience in parliament and the “real world”. At the same time, Ruston said she was realistic about how “devastating” the election results were for the Liberals. We all need to take a very analytical look at what happened on the election and the lead-up to the election. You only learn and are able to make change, positive change, to move forward, by reflecting on what went wrong. Pointed to whether it was time to act on quotas to improve female representation in the party, Ruston said “we need to look at everything” – whether it be “women voters” or other communities – but cautioned “you should pick the best person for the job”. I have never been a great supporter of quotas. I do believe that you have to take affirmative action to make sure you’ve got representation … I want to make it one of my roles going forward, to make sure we’re supporting young women, so they’re joining our party. I want to support all young people because they’re the future of the party. Will Sussan Ley fix the Liberal party’s “woman problem”? Sussan Ley says her appointment sends a positive signal to Australian women. But does the party really believe its “woman” problem can be fixed so easily? Former Liberal MP for Chisholm, Julia Banks, who later became an independent, is not so sure. Writing for Guardian Australia, she recalls Scott Morrison addressing the Liberal party room in 2018 with an “evangelical Trumpian fervour” after taking down Malcom Turnbull to become leader. He pointed to the framed photographs of previous Liberal leaders and prime ministers and said, in what I’m sure he thought was a Churchillian tone: “One day there will be a woman there.” The room was glum with silence, pierced only by [Julie] Bishop’s quiet quip. In which century? Read the piece here: Two arrested after homemade shotgun found in Melbourne car In Victoria, two 22-year-olds have been arrested after a homemade shotgun was discovered in a car. Detectives undertook a search warrant early this morning at a home in the Melbourne suburb of Pakenham. As part of the investigation, they searched a woman’s car outside the address, where they discovered a slam gun (a homemade shotgun) and four cartridges of shotgun ammunition. The woman, 22, and a 22-year-old male, both from Pakenham, were arrested and interviewed by investigators. This afternoon, they were charged with two counts of possess handgun and two counts of possess ammunition. They were bailed to appear at Dandenong magistrates court on 25 August. NT anti-corruption commissioner resigns after a year of paid leave following claims of inappropriate behaviour An anti-corruption commissioner on paid leave for nearly a year has resigned after the completion of a report into claims of inappropriate behaviour in his office, AAP reports. The resignation of Michael Riches has prompted the inspector of the Northern Territory’s Independent Commissioner Against Corruption to terminate further investigation into the matter. The chief minister, Lia Finocchiaro, said in a statement that her predecessor Eva Lawler had referred workplace allegations within the office of Icac to the Commissioner for Public Employment for investigation. Finocchiaro received the report last week and it was referred to the Icac inspector to determine any further action. Riches, who was appointed in July 2021 and understood to be on a salary of about $500,000, tendered his resignation on Tuesday. The Icac inspector informed the chief minister he exercised his discretion to terminate further investigation as it was “no longer in the public interest and is an unnecessary expenditure of territory resources”. Finocchiaro said: As a new government we share the community’s frustrations regarding the length of time and costs in which this whole process has taken. In June 2024, the then chief minister Lawler said the Icac inspector, Bruce McClintock, found Riches had not “improperly offered $20,000 to his former wife to suppress an allegation of domestic violence”. AAP is not suggesting Riches committed any criminal acts or broke the law. Expert council to examine senior university staff pay, education minister says The education minister has confirmed an expert council will provide recommendations to ministers later this year on the salaries of senior university staff, after Guardian Australia revealed just three of Victoria’s vice-chancellors took pay cuts last year. The findings come amid outside pressure to address “broken” university governance and accusations of “executive largesse”. Jason Clare told Guardian Australia “we need to strengthen governance arrangements in our universities”: That’s why I have set up an Expert Council on University Governance that will look at everything from how universities pay staff, to the remuneration settings of senior university staff, and report to education ministers later this year. The council will help build better institutional governance structures and contribute to making universities better places to study and work. NSW debates bill to allow nurse practitioners and midwives to prescribe abortion pills NSW is debating a bill that would allow easier access to abortion pills if it is passed by allowing nurse practitioners and registered midwives to prescribe the medication. The vote in the lower house on Greens health spokesperson Dr Amanda Cohn’s abortion amendment bill to progress to debating amendments took place shortly before 3pm. The speaker confirmed that with 64 members who supported the bill and only 20 who opposed, the motion was carried. A final vote will take place after amendments are debated and voted upon. The new legislation on medical abortions would bring NSW in line with other Australian states which have passed similar laws. A medical abortion involves taking prescribed abortion pills up to nine weeks gestation, while a surgical abortion is a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting. The bill already passed the upper house on Thursday last week. This blog post was amended on 14 May to correct the description of the vote. A previous version incorrectly stated the final vote had occurred. Bradfield back ‘in doubt’ as Liberals hope Kapterian can hold off late Boele surge Liberal party members in New South Wales say they are optimistic Gisele Kapterian can hold off an apparent late surge in support for independent Nicolette Boele, with the seat of Bradfield to be decided by a tiny margin. Media outlets including the ABC and Sky News called the seat for Kapterian earlier this week, but Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) counting on Wednesday showed her lead slimming to just 80 votes. The ABC elections results page was listing Bradfield as a seat “in doubt” on Wednesday afternoon. Read more from Tom McIlroy here: Universities need to make case for the benefits of higher education sector, Shorten says Industry needs to “lift its game” in Australia and spend money on research and development, Bill Shorten says, while calling on universities to make their case to the public. Speaking at an online event hosted by La Trobe University on Tuesday evening, the former federal Labor leader said in a world with competing priorities for resources, higher education had to explain the benefits of the sector: The world doesn’t owe us at universities a living, we have to make the case. When universities go to governments, they say, ‘We’re very good people, fund us’. That doesn’t work any more. A lot of Australians don’t know what universities do. Shorten, now the vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra, said a discussion with industry was needed about them paying for more of higher education. Industry needs to lift its game in this country. If you want an R&amp;D [research and development] budget, how about you spend some money? Shorten said universities had to go beyond marketing themselves and ensure they prevented wage theft, in addition to giving domestic and international students a quality experience. – AAP Police take 68-year-old man into custody in far north Queensland after alleged shooting In far north Queensland, a 68-year-old man has been taken into custody after an alleged shooting on Tuesday evening in a small Tablelands town. At about 9.30pm, a 44-year-old man attended an address in Silver Valley and became involved in an alleged altercation with the 68-year-old male, who police say was known to him. During the altercation, the 44-year-old sustained gunshot wounds to his abdomen and calf, police allege. He drove home before calling police and was transported to Mareeba hospital, then airlifted to Cairns hospital. He was in a serious but stable condition on Wednesday afternoon. Following “protracted negotiations” with police, the 68-year-old man was taken into custody at a Silver Valley property at about 11.45am today. Bowen mocks Liberals’ equivocation on ‘bare minimum’ target of net zero by 2050 Chris Bowen has ridiculed the Liberal party for putting net zero by 2050 up for review after its election defeat, comparing it to putting the “sky being blue” up for debate. The climate change and energy minister also warned that breaking Australia’s bipartisan commitment to the “bare minimum” emissions target risked creating a sovereign risk for renewables investors. Read more from Dan Jervis-Bardy here: Local stock market edges lower while financial sector remains flat The Australian stock market is edging lower as an improved US economic outlook helped push Wall Street within reach of its all-time highs, AAP reports. The S&amp;P/ASX200 was down 13.9 points, or 0.17%, to 8,255.1, while the broader All Ordinaries lost 9.8 points, or 0.12%, to 8,501.5. Wall Street’s S&amp;P500 continued to push higher for a second session amid cooling trade tensions between the US and China, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied 1.6% as deals were struck between US tech companies and Saudi Arabia startup Humain. The broader market painted a picture of investors moving out of defensive stocks in the hunt for more growth. “There’s the reversal of the sell-America trade, which had prevailed since Liberation Day, which is to say investors were selling US assets because of growth risks but … also because of basically country risk,” Capital.com market analyst Kyle Rodda told AAP. The S&amp;P500 and Australia’s two leading indexes are within 5% of their all-time peaks. Six of 11 local sectors were trading higher by lunchtime, led by a continued rebound in energy stocks after oil prices rose for a fourth straight session. The financial sector is trading roughly flat in its third session of anaemic performance, with the Commonwealth Bank rising 0.5% after quarterly earnings were in line with expectations. Investment bank Macquarie’s three-day, nearly 10% rally is set to snap, with shares down 2.1% after its cash brokering arm was sued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I will now hand over the blog to my colleague, Caitlin Cassidy, who will take you through the remainder of the day. Chalmers says he supports Asic’s work but will not comment on Macquarie Bank case On the Asic case against Macquarie Bank over allegedly failing to report sales to the sharemarket operator, Chalmers said he supports the work of Asic, but would not comment on the details citing the ongoing litigation. We want to make sure that everybody is playing by the rules in our economy, and especially in our financial system and the regulators play an important role in ensuring that. And I support their work. He said the case shows that Asic is a well-funded regulator. Higher tax rate for super earnings on balances over $3m would affect 0.5% of people, treasurer says The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has held a press conference off the back of the latest wages growth numbers. He’s asked about the policy on taxing super earnings on balances over $3m at 30%, up from 15% currently. He says the changes have been in the public domain for two years now, and affect just 0.5% of people. On a proposal to tax unrealised gains, he notes two newspapers have been covering it a lot but says he is “not generally or genuinely stopped in the street about these changes”. I think that most people recognise that these are modest changes, affect a tiny, tiny sliver of people with superannuation. Still concessional tax treatment – just slightly less concessional for people with very large superannuation balances. And so I know that I read about it obviously in a couple of our newspapers most days. But I’m sure that people broadly recognise that it’s a modest change, but it makes a difference to the budget. And that’s why we put it forward more than two years ago. Australia’s ageing coal power stations broke down 128 times during the hotter months of 2024-25, according to a report from Reliability Watch. On average 5.1 gigawatts of coal fired capacity was offline across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria between October 2024 and March 2025 – the equivalent of powering 1.2m homes. Breakdowns were eight times more common than forecast outages, according to the report, which also found a strong correlation between coal being offline and high wholesale prices. Reliability Watch – a collaboration between the Queensland Conservation Council, Nature Conservation Council of NSW, and Environment Victoria – live-tracks the breakdowns of Australia’s ageing coal units. Queensland Conservation Council director Dave Copeman said: Australia’s ageing coal power stations are breaking down nearly every day. Any responsible government can see that we have to urgently build more renewable energy backed by storage to keep the lights on and keep power prices under control. At the National Press Club today, the co-founder and chief executive of Cheek Media, Hannah Ferguson, announced her intention to run at the next federal election for the Senate as an independent candidate. Ferguson was also asked about the controversy over content creators interviewing politicians during the election and whether it required authorisation on their posts during an election campaign. Ferguson said content creators should not be collaboratively posting with politicians. I think that is an endorsement. And even if we can say it’s clearly not, I think the public are fair to be confused by that when consuming Instagram content. She said she had said no to money from multiple political organisations during this election cycle: And that was why so much of it was offensive, because I actively ensured I was a commentator that was freed from everything was my bias, but I was forthcoming with this. She said there needs to be clear regulations and guidance for social media on authorisations, endorsements and collaborative posting. Ahead of the Greens making a decision on a new leader, Ferguson said it should be Senator Sarah Hanson-Young (who was sitting in the audience). The latest numbers from the Bradfield and Longman ballot counts An update on two seats we have been watching as the Australian Electoral Commission continues to count votes. In the NSW seat of Bradfield, the Liberal candidate, Gisele Kapterian has extended her lead but just out to 80 votes ahead of independent Nicolette Boele, with 92.8% counted. So a recount still seems quite likely at this stage. In the Queensland seat of Longman, the LNP’s Terry Young leads Labor’s Rhiannyn Douglas by 121 votes, with 87.1% counted. Labor government claims credit for wages growth The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and employment minister, Amanda Rishworth, have claimed credit for the 0.9% wages index increase we reported earlier. In a joint release, the pair say annual real wages have grown for 18 months in a row under the current government: We’re really pleased with today’s figures which show annual real wages have now grown for six quarters in a row, after going badly backwards under the previous Liberal government and falling for the five quarters in the lead up to the 2022 election. Australians voted for higher wages at the election, and that’s what today’s numbers show. Chalmers and Rishworth said the government’s policies were driving wage growth: We’re acting to boost wages, close the gender pay gap, deliver workplace relations reforms and secure pay rises for some of the lowest-paid workers in our community. Our support for the lowest paid workers means minimum wage earners are now earning $143.30 per week more than when we came to government. At the same time, we’ve overseen the creation of more than 1 million jobs in our first three years, a record for a parliamentary term and stronger employment growth than any major advanced economy. This means under Labor real wages are up, unemployment is low, inflation is down, interest rates have started to fall, every taxpayer is getting a tax cut and living standards are growing again in our economy. But they said the job is not finished, with Australians still under pressure and more global economic volatility and unpredictability predicted over the next three years.

NSW Greens introduce bill to enact statewide 30km/h residential speed limit Unsafe roads are forcing parents to drive children less than one kilometre to school, say safety advocates pushing for lower speed limits, AAP reports. Restricting cars and trucks to 30km/h would be the norm for neighbourhood streets under proposed laws being unveiled on Wednesday. The change comes amid rising fatalities on Australian roads in the face of a national goal to eliminate all road deaths and serious injuries by 2050. While nine out of 10 people die when hit by a vehicle driving at 50km/h, nine in 10 people survive when hit at 30 km/h, safety advocate Jennifer Kent says. NSW Greens MP Kobi Shetty has introduced the bill to enact a statewide 30km/h limit on residential roads. She says it’s the “most impactful” way to protect motorists, cyclists and pedestrians from road accidents as drivers will be forced to travel slower in high traffic areas. If adopted, NSW would follow Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK in lowering limits to such levels. In those areas, communities have seen a 40% reduction in fatalities on roads that have these limits, Shetty said. The cost to motorists was meanwhile between 30 seconds to one minute for each journey, research suggested. The premier, Chris Minns, however, doubled down on opposition to 30km/h caps first aired in 2024. “I think that’s too slow,” he told reporters on Wednesday. Shetty’s bill will be debated at a later date. Lending falls in March quarter The number of new investment loans fell by 3.7% in the March quarter, while new home loans fell by 3.4%, new data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows. Head of finance statistics at the ABS, Dr Mish Tan, said the overall fall in lending followed strong growth in 2024 and still remained higher (+6%) than this time last year. There were 79,890 new home loans approved in the most recent quarter, while the total value of new home loans approved was $53.2bn, a quarterly fall of 2.5% ($1.3bn). The average loan size fell by $6,100 to $659,922. The largest fall was in Queensland, which dropped by 2.5% or 44 loans, followed by Victoria (a 1.1% fall, or 270 fewer loans). Tan: While higher than this time last year, the 79,890 new home loans approved in the March quarter was lower than the pre-pandemic quarterly average of 84,405 loans between 2015 and 2019. While we have seen two consecutive quarters of falls in the value of new investment loans, it remained just below the all-time high seen in March 2022. The number of owner-occupier first home buyer loans fell by 4.2% (1,243 loans) to 28,383. There were falls in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. Wages picked up a little stronger than expected at the start of 2025 to continue clawing back the purchasing power households lost from three years of high inflation. The wage price index rose 0.9% in the three months to March, holding steady with inflation over the same period while lifting annual wage growth to 3.4%. Consumer prices rose just 2.4% over the same period, meaning the gap between Australians’ living costs and pay packets is gradually narrowing. Private sector wage growth has eased from its 2024 high of 4.2% to remain at 3.3% annually to March, but public sector growth jumped to 3.6%, helped by recent wage decisions for aged care workers and nurses and early childhood workers. Those agreements also saw enterprise agreements overtake individual agreements to become the biggest contributor to quarterly wage growth, for the first time since 2020. Major banks CBA, ANZ and Westpac had expected wage growth to pick up from its 0.7% December quarterly rate but not as high as 0.9%. Commonwealth Bank economist Stephen Wu, in a note last week, said: Overall wages growth is expected to continue to slow as further spare capacity in the labour market emerges. Indeed, we view risks to the wages outlook this year as skewed to the downside. The Albanese government will cheer the result, after campaigning on the promise the economy had turned the corner and real wages were rising. Australians’ purchasing power would have fallen had wages risen any slower than inflation. Liberal senator Jane Hume has said it was “disturbing” Labor used her claims of “Chinese spies” handing out for Labor at the election as a “scare campaign”. In the last weeks of the election, Hume claimed some Chinese Australians handing out how-to-vote cards for Labor may have been “Chinese spies”. The claim came in response to reporting that a Chinese community association, which was allegedly linked to China’s Communist party, was handing out election material for Labor and teal candidates, including Clare O’Neil. Analysts suggested swings against the Liberals in key marginal seats may have been affected in part by the comments. Speaking on Sky News on Wednesday, Hume acknowledged her comments wouldn’t have helped the Coalition, but she did not back down from them. Let’s be clear what the issue there was, is, there was a suspicion by the Australian electoral integrity taskforce of foreign interference in our electoral system. Now that is a genuine concern, and something that I think that the government should be equally concerned about. It wasn’t something that they could so easily dismiss, and instead, they turned it into a scare campaign against Liberals. I find that a little bit disturbing. For the foreign minister to dismiss it out of hand, I think, speaks volumes. I’ll be very interested to see what that electoral integrity assurance taskforce comes up with, because the last thing we want is that for election results to be influenced by non-Australians, by organisations, wherever they may be, state actors outside of the country. The Australian Human Rights Commission has said it suffered a data breach after 670 attachments to submissions made on its website were found to be publicly accessible and discoverable via web search. The commission said of these 670 documents, about 100 were accessed. The breach has been addressed, the commission said. The commission takes the issue of privacy and data protection very seriously. It is critical that people are able to securely share personal and sensitive information with the commission via our website. We sincerely apologise to people who may be affected. The commission is contacting affected individuals for whom we have contact information to advise them of the breach. We are working as hard as we can to fully investigate and address the breach. The commission has reported the unauthorised disclosure of personal information to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The commission said it became aware of the breach of documents submitted on its complaint form on 10 April, and the disclosure was inadvertent rather than malicious. The commission said it affects complaints made on the site between 24 March and 10 April, and the documents were publicly accessible for one week, between 3 and 10 April. Other web forms, including the Speaking from Experience project, the Human Rights Awards nominations for 2023, and the National Anti-Racism Framework were also affected and available between 3 April and 5 May. Some attachments contained personal information, the commission said. Individuals affected will be notified. National approach preferred on church liability: Victorian government Kilkenny says her preference is for a national approach to changing the law and has been pushing “really strongly” for the standing council of attorney generals to act. A national approach ... makes it easier for victim-survivors to seek compensation. They’re not having to wade through different judicial areas or different jurisdictions that might be applying different types of law. We’re also looking at employment law, which is a federal issue as well. So it is really, really complex. It is important that we get this right. The last thing we want to do is deliver unintended consequences that will not serve justice and not deliver justice [for] these victim-survivors. But she didn’t close the door on a state-based approach, saying: “We will do what we need to do to ensure justice for victim-survivors here in Victoria.” Victorian government ‘considering options’ on bill on Catholic church liability A bill put forward by Legalise Cannabis MP Rachel Payne to remove a key legal barrier preventing victims of historical child sexual abuse from accessing justice is being debated in Victorian parliament’s upper house today. It’s a direct response to the high court’s decision late last year, which found the Catholic church was not vicariously liable for abuse by a Ballarat priest as he was not technically an employee. This bill seeks to make institutions liable for abuse committed by individuals “akin to employees” and apply the change retrospectively. The attorney general, Sonya Kilkenny, says the government is considering how to respond to the high court decision. She told reporters: The Legalised Cannabis Victoria party is introducing a bill … I have no doubt there will be just respectful, empathic discussion and debate on that bill as is deserving in our place of parliament. I’ve met many times with the private member who is bringing in that bill to talk about her bill and options as well, and earlier this year, I led discussion at the national level, at the standing committee of attorneys general on this very matter ... We are considering our options right now. I am also still and will continue to lead that discussion at a national level. We will always stand on the side of victim-survivors of this insidious abuse that has been perpetrated against such innocent victims here, and we’ll have more to say on that soon. Macquarie Bank’s stockbroker arm is being sued by the corporate regulator, which alleges it misled the sharemarket operator for 14 years by failing to properly report at least 73m sales, and potentially as many as 1.5bn. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) claims Macquarie Securities faced multiple systems-related issues, many of which remained undetected for over a decade and were responsible for the alleged misreporting. Including Wednesday’s announcement, Asic has taken four regulatory actions against Macquarie Group in just over a year. Joe Longo, Asic’s chair, said: Our actions reflect the ongoing and deep concerns we have with Macquarie Group and its weak remediation of longstanding issues. Asic just last week imposed additional licence conditions on Macquarie Bank over what it has described as “multiple and significant compliance failures” in sales of some financial instruments. Today’s announcement relates to a separate arm, the subsidiary Macquarie Securities or MSAL, which had issues reporting short sales. Asic increased reporting requirements for short sales in the wake of the global financial crisis to improve transparency. Longo said: This action is timely given significant recent global market volatility. Accurate and reliable data underpins the integrity of, and confidence in, Australia’s financial markets … We allege Macquarie’s failures may have led to the financial services industry relying on misleading and false information for over 14 years. Short sales are trades where the seller seeks to profit on a financial asset when its price decreases – the opposite of the traditional buy-and-hold approach to stock trading. A short seller borrows a security or stock and then sells it at the current high price, with the intention of buying the stock back at a lower price in future to repay the loan obligations. In the wake of the announcement, Macquarie Group said MSAL identified the issues in reporting trading volumes and told Asic in 2022 before identifying and sharing a number of related issues. Macquarie said it had remedied those issues and implemented additional controls and took its compliance obligations very seriously, and MSAL was reviewing Asic’s claim. Pokies manufacturer complains about negative political and media sentiment around gaming One of the world’s largest poker machine manufacturers, Aristocrat, has complained about “politically driven inquiries” into the gambling industry and “negative political and media sentiment around gaming”. The criticism was outlined in Aristocrat’s latest half-year financial results, which detailed a 5.6% increase in year-on-year net profit after tax of $732m. The company’s games division recorded a 141% increase in revenue. Aristocrat was initially a member of the NSW government’s independent expert panel on gambling which was advising on regulatory changes. The company withdrew from a NSW government trial of cashless gaming which was introduced in response to concerns about money laundering. The Victorian, Queensland and federal governments have recently held their own inquiries. The gambling giant did not refer to any specific inquiries or policies in its financial results: In Australia, negative political and media sentiment around gaming impacting our capacity for effective industry advocacy, and increasing the scope for negative policy-making, politically driven inquiries and increased shareholder requirements continued. Aristocrat continues to engage with the government. We have also seen an increasing trend of allegations that social casino games should be classified as illegal gambling, particularly in the US and Australia. Increased regulatory scrutiny and the need for enhanced consumer protection continue to drive changes to the risk profile. The federal Liberal vice-president, Fiona Scott, has walked back earlier tongue-in-cheek comments after responding “a day is a long time in politics” when asked how long she thinks the Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, would last in the job. Speaking on Sky News after her Nine appearance, Scott said people should “definitely not” read into her comments that she thinks Ley would only last 24 hours in the job. That was just a bit of a joke at the time. She said she supports Ley and the deputy, Ted O’Brien, and was not concerned about the longevity of their leadership given the divided vote in the partyroom. We also have had opposition leaders like Tony Abbott that took us to an election nearly won, and then stayed on as opposition leader. I think you’ve got to see as the ebbs and flows as things move forward. But I think Sussan and Ted that they’re not there for a short time. They are there to help rebuild and refocus our party, and I’m completely confident that both of them will do so. NT doubles tax on gambling companies prompting wagering lobby ‘concern’ The gambling industry’s lobby group has expressed “serious concern” about the Northern Territory government’s decision to double tax on bookmakers, arguing it risks undermining the territory’s reputation as a hub for gaming. A majority of online sports gambling companies are registered and regulated by the NT government, which has traditionally offered lower tax rates to entice businesses to open there. Responsible Wagering Australia’s chief executive, Kai Cantwell, said the decision would threaten the investments of several bookmakers. Cantwell also said the decision had been made before a review of the wagering industry was released. RWA have participated meaningfully in the review and eagerly anticipated a new strategic vision for racing in the territory. This decision, made before the review has had a chance to lay that strategic vision, has blindsided wagering service providers and materially undermines any outcome of the review. One gambling industry operator not authorised to comment publicly said the tax increase was unlikely to hurt large players registered in the NT – like Sportsbet – but could harm smaller operators: The change lets foreign giants totally off the hook while harming their domestic competition. Small operators will have to recoup the cost by decreasing their investment and employment in the northern territory. A parliamentary inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy called for the establishment of a national regulator, arguing the NT was not adequately resourced to monitor the industry. Premier says vandalism of Yarra Captain Cook memorial ‘deeply disrespectful’ Allan was also asked about the City of Yarra’s decision to permanently remove a Captain Cook memorial from Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy North after repeated acts of vandalism. She says the development is “deeply disappointing”: Any sort of senseless vandalism of monuments, of public spaces and places – it’s deeply disrespectful and I think we’ve seen enough of the division. Allan says stamp duty helps pay for essential services Allan was asked whether she would go further and scrap stamp duty altogether in favour of a broad-based land tax. She says her government has “already done that” for industrial and commercial land – though that wasn’t the question. Allan went on: What we’re announcing here today is another tax cut, having listened to industry, but also too recognising there’s a range of initiatives that we need to take and we must take. If you want to talk about different settings in different states, look at what the data is telling us – we are building, completing and approving more homes here in Victoria than any other state. Pressed on why she won’t scrap stamp duty, Allan says the revenue it raises helps pay for essential services: All states have state-based settings that provide revenue … to deliver school funding, to deliver hospital funding, to provide the pay rise to nurses that we delivered last year, to support our police. The investment that we receive gets put back into those frontline services that Victorians that working people and families rely on. That’s true for all states, but particularly true here in Victoria. But also too we’re looking at what more can be done, which is why we’ve announced the extension of the off-the-plan stamp duty concession today. Allan says stamp duty concession extension will save thousands for buyers and help developers The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, held a press conference this morning at a new development in Docklands to announce the extension of stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan purchases for 12 months. As we brought to you earlier, next week’s state budget will include $61m to continue the concession for new apartments, townhouses and units. Rather than basing stamp duty on the final sale price, it is calculated on the land value prior to construction. Allan told reporters it is saving buyers thousands: We first announced this in October of last year and … it is already making a difference … On average, $25,000 is being saved through this slashing of the planned stamp duty concession. But also for developers … it provides them with an opportunity to get projects like this out of the ground more quickly. It means that they can get more pre-sales with that off the plan purchasing approach, which means these developments can get away with greater certainty. The Liberal vice president, Fiona Scott, was asked how long she thinks new leader of the party Sussan Ley will last, appearing on the Today show earlier this morning. She said: I don’t know. I mean, a day is a long time in politics! When the host responds “that is not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Scott clarifies “it won’t be a day, [I’m being] cheeky” and thinks “Sussan is fantastic”. Penny Wong’s response? “Ouch!” Woolworths is cutting prices from today. Expect more supermarket competition – but not an all-out price war Woolworths is cutting prices on hundreds of products from Wednesday, raising hopes the supermarket sector is entering a new period of intensifying competition, colloquially known as a price war. But after a bruising period for the supermarket sector, marked by allegations of price-gouging during a cost-of-living crisis, shoppers may be sceptical of seeing any relief. Is the era of fast-rising grocery prices and supercharged supermarket profits really coming to an end?

He told RN Breakfast it was an issue that weighed heavily on MPs. From my perspective as a feminist, I take the view that we need to try and make sure that this of this level of healthcare and this accessibility, this type of healthcare, is improved across New South Wales. But I also respect having listened to and spoke with a number of colleagues across the parliament, as well as in the community, that this is a tough issue for many people, and certainly when I spoke last night in the parliament on this. I encourage members to have a look at the bill, but also encourage people to make their contributions in a respectful way, because for many people, this is a deeply personal issue, and I think as legislators, we have to reflect that as well. He said the legislation will make abortions much more accessible for women in regional, rural and remote areas by allowing nurse practitioners and endorsed midwives to carry out this type of healthcare. Park said he hopes NSW doesn’t go down the pathway of the “Americanisation of the abortion debate”, as the opposition leader, Mark Speakman, claimed it has in NSW. A parent group with more than 20,000 members will challenge one of Australia’s largest energy companies in court over claims it misled customers about emissions from its products, AAP reports. Representatives from EnergyAustralia will appear in the NSW Federal Court on Wednesday to defend the lawsuit filed by Parents for Climate in August 2023. The group claims the company misled more than 400,000 customers using its Go Neutral products, which EnergyAustralia allegedly marketed as “carbon neutral” due to the purchase of offsets, and claimed consumers would have a “positive impact on the environment” by purchasing them. But Parents for Climate will argue EnergyAustralia’s claims were misleading and deceptive, chief executive Nic Seton said, in a lawsuit that will become the first greenwashing case launched against an energy firm in Australia. It’s one of the most ambitious things that our organisation has ever done. It’s an Australian first in that no other product has been tested on these grounds of making carbon-neutral claims based on offsets. The charity, represented by Equity Generation Lawyers, will seek a declaration that EnergyAustralia misled customers about greenhouse gas emissions, a corrective statement to customers, and restrictions on its future marketing. EnergyAustralia withdrew its Go Neutral products for new customers in November but a spokesperson for the company said it was committed to offering customers clean energy solutions. “We have been working closely with Parents for Climate over the last number of months,” the spokesperson said. “We remain optimistic we can resolve this issue together.” Mortgage arrears hit six year highs at CBA More Australians are falling behind on their mortgage repayments, according to a trading update at Commonwealth Bank, with arrears now at six-year highs. The percentage of CBA’s home loan book that is more than 90 days behind increased to 0.71% in the March quarter, which is the highest level since 2019 and above the lender’s historical average. CBA is Australia’s biggest lender. The data shows that while there has been some easing in cost-of-living pressures, those already behind on their repayments are falling further behind. It is often an insurmountable task for a borrower to recover from a deficit once they are more than three months behind on repayments. CBA customers with personal loans also fell further behind, according to the quarterly update, with 90-plus day arrears also rising to six year highs. The bank reported a cash profit of $2.6bn during the three months to 31 March, up from $2.4bn a year earlier. Its profit margins have remained stable. Ted O’Brien refuses to make ‘vice-captain’s call’ on if nuclear policy will be kept or dumped The newly appointed deputy Liberal leader, Ted O’Brien – who was responsible for advocating the party’s nuclear policy prior to the election – would not commit to keeping or dumping the policy at this stage. He told ABC’s News Breakfast that he won’t be “making any vice-captain calls on policy” We will engage with the Australian people, we’ll be driven by data and evidence, as well as big ears – listening to people – and then we’ll be regrouping as a party, as a party room, we’ll be having debate and, hopefully, these debates are robust. They need to be, for the sake of Australia, they need to be, before we then land on policy direction. He said he had not had discussions with leader Sussan Ley about what portfolio he may have in the shadow ministry, noting Ley’s mother is unwell and Ley is spending time with her. O’Brien said he’s “really proud” to have Jacinta Nampijinpa Price in the Liberal party and the Liberals and Nationals work best as a coalition. He said Price, who bowed out of the deputy run after Angus Taylor lost the vote for leader, will continue to play an important role in the party. Bradfield margin narrows with just 59 votes separating the candidates There are just 59 votes separating Liberal Gisele Kapterian and independent Nicole Boele in the Sydney seat of Bradfield on a two-party preferred count, with 1,687 votes still to be counted. The ABC had initially called this seat for Kapterian, but has now put the seat back in doubt. It says, however, Kapterian is still favoured to win the seat. If the margin holds, or if it narrows as the count progresses, Boele is likely to ask for a recount. The AEC in the 2016 election opted independently – that is ,without a request – to recount the seat of Herbert when the difference between the two candidates was less than 100 votes. Liberals slipped from their core values, party vice-president says On why the Coalition lost the election, Scott says there were “a range of challenges” but said the “Australian public didn’t see themselves in us in this election.” Scott said the party has slipped from its core values, which should be uniting, around freedom of choice, of association, of voice, of worship, and a tolerant cohesive national society that rewards effort. We need to build a platform around those things. The other factor, she said is the Coalition – prior to 2022 – had been in government for nearly a decade, and there needed to be a rebuilding after that to evolve for new generations. Scott said she was torn on whether quotas for female MPs should be introduced. There’s been a challenge around female representation. As a woman, I haven’t felt myself hamstrung … even regarding going into one of the four vice-president’s roles, which there are two women and two men in that space. I do, though, believe that I can see the reason why a lot of women are pro quotas, and I’m not against quotas, but I think we need to ensure that there is a full diversity within our membership and within our female representation. Scott said quotas could potentially had a negative impact on ensuring that multicultural communities are represented if a female candidate was chosen instead of someone representing those communities. Liberal vice-president says appointment of Ley ‘unique opportunity’ for women of Australia and rebuilding of party The Federal Liberal vice-president, Fiona Scott, says the appointment of Sussan Ley as the Liberal party leader is a “really unique opportunity, not just for the women within the Liberal party, the women within Australia, but really embodying what it is the Australian dream and how the Liberal party can now rebuild around that.” Scott told ABC’s RN Breakfast the closeness of the vote between her and leadership rival Angus Taylor reflects the “broad church” of the Liberal party. What I think we will see is the Liberal party will rally behind Sussan and Ted [O’Brien]. You know, it doesn’t mean that great talents in our party, like Angus [Taylor] won’t still provide superb input, same as Jacinta [Nampijinpa Price], and it’s good to have that diversity of perspective and view, but right now, I think the party room did make the right decision yesterday, and you know, it’s really important on us that we’ve been given the opportunity, maybe taking kicking and screaming to have to rebuild the party and take it back to basics and move forward from there. And I think Sussan is a is a step forward to say that we have listened. Wong refuses to comment on if Husic could be breaching cabinet solidarity Wong said she understands why former minister Ed Husic is upset about being excluded from the new ministry in the government. On whether it was over his comments in relation to Gaza, Wong said “we all share concern about what is happening in Gaza”: We know how difficult it has been for the people of Gaza these last weeks and months. And we continue to join with others to call on Israel to ensure that aid is delivered. Wong would not comment on whether Husic was close to breaching cabinet solidarity. Wong comments on tariff deals and Ukraine On whether Australia should be lobbying harder for a tariffs deal with the United States, following the UK and US coming to an agreement, Wong says Australia will make “sensible decisions in our interest” and develop trading relationships with other countries. On reports of an Australian being killed fighting in Ukraine, Wong would not comment specifically but said it is a “very dangerous place to be” and consular assistance is being provided to a family in this matter. Wong says ‘there is no country more important for Australia’ than Indonesia The foreign minister, Penny Wong, says there is no more important country to Australia than Indonesia as Anthony Albanese heads to the nation today on his first overseas trip since re-election. Wong told ABC News Breakfast: That reflects the importance Indonesia has for Australian stability, for Australian security, for our region. There is no country more important for Australia, so we are very focused on making sure that we continue the work we did last term to invest in the relationship and to strengthen it, keep strengthening it and going further. Wong says the focus of the visit will be around partnership on the economy, trade, investment and defence. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has confirmed one container of ballot papers for the NSW seat of Barton was temporarily misplaced during the count, with a transport officer found to have possession of the container. The AEC said, however, it was recovered still sealed and undamaged and did not affect the outcome in Barton. In the seat, which Labor retained with Ash Ambihaipahar winning 61.66% of the two-party preferred vote, the AEC said all votes had been counted in the Hurstville polling place on election night. Once the ballot papers were transported securely for a second count as required, the AEC identified that one of two containers for House of Representative ballots at the polling place had not been returned. A spokesperson for the AEC said it was determined an authorised transport officer “inadvertently maintained possession of the single missing container.” The container was recovered with all uniquely coded security seals unbroken and without any damage. All ballot papers were still in the recovered ballot paper transport container and were promptly returned to the counting centre and have undergone fresh scrutiny. The fresh scrutiny count matched the initial count and the election in the Division of Barton was unaffected by this incident. The AEC said it was investigating the incident to see what could change to prevent it happening again in future elections. This shouldn’t have occurred, and the AEC is deeply concerned that on this single occasion our process did not prevent the issue on polling night when ballot papers were initially returned. Victoria to extend stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan purchases by 12 months The Victorian government will extend its stamp duty concessions for off-the-plan properties by another 12 months, as part of next week’s state budget. The premier, Jacinta Allan, will today announce $61m to continue the concessions for off-the-plan apartments, townhouses and units until October 2026. First announced last year, the concession applies to new properties at any price point and is open to all buyers, including investors. Rather than basing stamp duty on the final sale price, it is calculated on the land value prior to construction. For a new $620,000 off-the-plan apartment, that could mean a stamp duty bill of $4,000 – saving the buyer $28,000. According to the government, buyers have saved an average of $24,517 since the concession came into effect. Allan said in a statement: Young people can’t afford homes in a housing crisis, and I’m on their side. That’s why we’re slashing stamp duty for off-the-plan units and townhouses – to build more homes and make them cheaper to buy. The treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, said the extension responds to industry feedback: This isn’t just great news for homebuyers trying to get into the market. It’s also a huge win for homebuilders. The budget will also include $24m to develop the 50 proposed activity centres across Melbourne’s inner and middle suburbs while $12.1m will be spent to plan for 13,200 new homes in growth areas, including Clyde South and Derrimut Fields in Melbourne’s outer suburbs. Hello, this is Josh Taylor taking the live blog for this morning. As an experienced pilot who learned her trade in the Queensland outback, Sussan Ley is metaphorically better equipped than anyone in the Liberal party to plot a course back from the edge of the political wilderness to the centre ground. Her rise to the very frontline of politics after her victory in the Liberal party room election yesterday has lifted the lid on a varied Cv of which her aviation skills are but only one part. She can also boast of stints as a station cook and accountant, not to mention raising three children along the way. Tom McIlroy profiles the Liberal’s first female leader. Economists’ views on Trump tarriff chaos on our markets As mentioned above, there are serious concerns among market analysts that chaos unleashed by Donald Trump will cause problems for Australia. Jenny Gordon, an honorary professor at the ANU and a former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told our reporter there was no end in sight to the market uncertainty. Gordon said the experience of the UK and China demonstrated that countries were not coming to the White House as supplicants. “I think the one thing that has changed is that the world is pushing back against this idea that there would be countries turning up to the US and offering things,” she said. “And part of that is the Americans don’t know what they want. The Japanese asked the Americans ‘Tell us what you want’, and the response was ‘Tell us what you’ve got to give’. “Certainly countries are not coming on bended knees.” Read the whole story here: Separately, there are concerns the US president’s pressure on medicine companies could drive up the cost of Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or see companies withdraw some medicines from Australian shelves. Global tensions and Indonesia’s developing relationship with China and Russia will likely be on the agenda when Anthony Albanese makes his first overseas trip of his second term, Australian Associated Press reports. The prime minister will travel to Jakarta today where he will meet Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo released a video of his conversation with Albanese after his thumping election win, saying he was “so happy” to see him win another term. The prime minister told the Indonesian president he wanted Jakarta to be his first visit – not Washington or Beijing. The first state visit to Indonesia continued a legacy set up by the Howard government, which was symbolic in projecting Australia’s identity as being close to Asia, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s senior analyst, Gatra Priyandita, said. “Albanese is interested in maintaining that image of Australia as being independent of the United States and close to the region,” he told AAP. “There is great interest in Indonesia’s developing relationship with both Russia and China, with Indonesia establishing some of its first naval exercises with Russia recently, so it will probably be under discussion.” Reports in April that Moscow was seeking permission from Jakarta for Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft to be based in Indonesia alarmed Canberra. Indonesian authorities reassured their Australian counterparts that would not be the case, but did not confirm if the request had been made. The prime minister went back on a pledge to attend Prabowo’s inauguration in October 2024 because of a visit to Australia by King Charles. Dr Gatra said his concern was that this new visit to Jakarta would be purely symbolic. “I haven’t heard much in the context of practical deliverables,” he said. “It’s very important for Australia and Indonesia to think about strategic co-operation ... especially since both Albanese and Prabowo will likely be counterparts for quite some time.” Child killed and three injured in NSW road collision A child has died and three people have been injured in a collision between a ute and a truck on the New South Wales south coast, the state’s police force has said. Last night, police said emergency services had been called to Towamba Road in Nullica near Eden at about 4.10pm yesterday, where they found a six-year-old boy who had been travelling in the dual-cab ute had died at the scene. The driver, a man aged in his 30s, and a three-year-old girl, who was a passenger in the ute, suffered multiple injuries were flown to hospital from Merimbula airport, police said. A third passenger in the ute, an eight-year-old girl, was taken to South-East Regional hospital in Bega, police said. Police said the driver of the truck, believed to be aged in his 50s, had been taken to the same hospital in Bega for mandatory testing and to be treated for the effects of shock. Police said police from the southern region crash investigation investigation unit would examine the scene of the collison. Towamba Road was expected to be closed for part of the night as the investigation began. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories before your regular blogger takes over the reins. Yesterday Jim Chalmers said policy uncertainty means Australia is in for a lot of economic uncertainty. Today, we report on how although signs of appeasement between the US and China on trade is good news for Australia’s China-dependent economy, many market experts think that the chaos created by Donald Trump is “worse than the 10% tariff”. Reflecting that, perhaps, the ASX200 is set to open down around 0.5% when it opens later this morning. We’ll have more as it happens. Anthony Albanese will make his first overseas visit since winning the election when he sets off for Indonesia today. The prime minister will travel to Jakarta where he will meet Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto. The summit follows reports during the election campaign that Moscow was seeking permission from Jakarta for Russian aerospace forces aircraft to be based in Indonesia, causing alarm in Canberra.","2025-05-14T07:50:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/may/14/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-jakarta-subianto-liberal-coalition-sussan-ley-energy-trade-tariffs-russia-defence-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Teenager accused of illegal abortion told police she had stillbirth, court hears","A teenager accused of taking a pill to illegally abort a baby told police she had reconciled herself to the idea of having the child but suffered a stillbirth, a jury has heard. Sophie Harvey, who was 19 at the time, said she panicked and wrapped the dead baby in a towel, put it in a plastic bag and placed it in a bin at the family home in Gloucestershire. She said she had not told anyone she was pregnant apart from her boyfriend, Elliot Benham, who was also 19, and that her family was away at the time. The prosecution alleges that Harvey procured pills to cause an abortion after being told she could not have a lawful termination, and took one of them. Both defendants bowed their heads while part of a police interview that Harvey gave in November 2018 was read out to the jury at Gloucester crown court. At times Harvey appeared tearful. Harvey told police she and Benham had gone to a clinic at the end of August 2018 after she found out she was pregnant but were informed she was “too far gone” for an abortion. The prosecution alleges Harvey was 28 weeks and five days pregnant, beyond the limit for a legal termination. “I didn’t know what to do,” she said. “I didn’t tell anyone. I was scared.” But then she thought that having a baby wouldn’t be “the worst thing in the world”, she said. She believed she would still be able to work and carry on with her hobby of dancing. “I could try and get through it all,” she told police. She said she did not want to put the baby up for adoption and Benham promised to support her. “He just said it was up to me, it was my choice.” But she said that on a Sunday in September – she thought it was 9 September – she started to feel pain and the baby was born in the toilet. “It was blue,” she said. “There was no sign of life, no movement at all.” She told officers: “I was overwhelmed and scared.” She said she wrapped the baby in a towel, put it in a plastic bag and placed it in a bin. Asked by officers if the child was a boy or girl, she said: “I didn’t want to look.” Asked if Benham had looked, she said: “He didn’t want to know.” She said the house was empty apart from them as her sister was taking part in a dance competition. The prosecution has alleged that when they were told Harvey could not have a legal abortion, they sent off for a kit containing five pills that can bring about an abortion. When police searched the house they found a kit, but it was missing one pill – the first one typically taken. The prosecution claims they disposed of the baby to hide that Harvey had taken an illegal pill. Harvey told police the baby was stillborn after Benham ordered the pills, but before they actually arrived. She confirmed she had asked the company that supplied the pills questions, such as if they had to pass through customs, because she was worried about the police catching them. In his first police interview, Benham said the baby had been flushed down the toilet. He said they had been prepared to keep the child but he had not told his parents because of embarrassment and because they would be “really disappointed” in him. Harvey denies procuring poison with intent to procure a miscarriage and denies administering poison with intent to procure a miscarriage. Harvey and Benham both deny undertaking an act intending to pervert the course of justice by disposing of a child. The jury has been told that both defendants, now 25, had admitted the charge of concealing the birth of a baby while Benham, from Wiltshire, had “acknowledged” his part in procuring the tablets. The trial continues.","2024-05-15T14:22:01Z","https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/15/gloucestershire-teen-accused-of-abortion-told-police-she-had-stillbirth"
"abortion","Louisiana moves to add abortion pills to list of controlled dangerous substances","Louisiana may soon become the first state in the country to pass a bill adding two common abortion pills to the state’s list of controlled dangerous substances, leading individuals who are caught with the drugs and lack authorization to potentially face years in prison. Like the rest of the US deep south, Louisiana already bans almost all abortions. But recently, when a house committee in the Republican-controlled legislature debated a bill to ban people from performing abortions on people without their consent, lawmakers added an amendment to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs typically used in medication abortions, as Schedule IV drugs. Under that amendment, a woman who obtains the drugs “for her own consumption” would not face penalties, but anyone who possesses them without a prescription or outside of normal medical practice could. In Louisiana, people who possess Schedule IV drugs can face up to five years in prison, while people who produce, distribute or intend to distribute such drugs can be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. They can also face thousands of dollars in fines. The bill would address a growing frustration among anti-abortion activists: the persistent flow of abortion pills into states with abortion bans, thanks to suppliers who operate outside of the US healthcare system and who use the internet and mail to help people looking to evade abortion bans. In March, a study found that in the six months after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, about 26,000 more Americans used pills to induce their own at-home abortions than would have done so had Roe not collapsed. Elisa Wells, co-director of Plan C, a website that maintains a directory of abortion pill suppliers, was unconvinced that this bill would succeed in cracking down on such suppliers. “Pills by mail – they’re in all 50 states and authorities have not been able to prevent that from happening,” Wells said. “The mail system is large and complex and many things are traveling through the mail that the authorities have not been able to regulate. We think it’s too large a problem for them to effectively address.” A week after the committee on administration of criminal justice advanced the bill to criminalize possession of mifepristone and misoprostol, that same committee shot down a bill that would have carved out exceptions in Louisiana’s abortion ban to allow children under 16 to get the procedure if they have been the victims of rape or incest. Louisiana law currently does not permit abortions in those circumstances. “That baby [in the womb] is innocent,” said one Republican committee member, Dodie Horton, as she voted against the bill, according to the Louisiana Illuminator. “We have to hang on to that.” The Democratic representative who proposed that bill, Delisha Boyd, said that her mother gave birth to Boyd after being raped at 15. Her mother never got over the rape and died before 30, according to Boyd. Since the abortion ban took effect, the OB-GYN Neelima Sukhavasi told state legislators that she and colleagues had helped teenagers deliver babies after being raped. “One of these teenagers delivered a baby while clutching a teddy bear,” Sukhavasi said, according to ABC News. “And that’s an image that once you see that, you can’t unsee it.” The sponsor of the bill to classify mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, the Republican senator Thomas Pressly, also drew on personal experience. His sister has said her then husband slipped her a drug to cause an abortion without her knowledge in 2022. However, mifepristone and misoprostol are not only used in abortions. They can also be used to manage miscarriages, which can resemble abortions. Dealing with miscarriages has become far more fraught in the wake of Roe’s demise, as women and doctors alike fear that women who go to hospitals for help after miscarriages could be wrongly accused of having illegal abortions and face criminal consequences. “Nobody should be afraid to seek medical care when they need it,” Wells said. “These laws that are trying to restrict access to abortion are creating that fear and causing people to not know about their options and not trust in the options that they have available to them.”","2024-05-14T16:36:44Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/14/louisiana-abortion-pills-dangerous-substances-list"
"abortion","Dear America: women’s bodies are not state property","A Black pregnant woman who was declared brain dead back in February is still being kept alive on a ventilator, because of a Georgia law that prohibits abortions beyond six weeks. If this sounds like the stuff of speculative fiction, it’s because there’s literally a Handmaid’s Tale episode about this. And while the TV show based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 book may have gotten many things right about the soul of authoritarianism and a violently patriarchal society, living that reality is even more sickening. Anyone who thinks this is about the life of Adriana Smith’s child is fooling themselves. This is the state, boundary testing to see how far they can take their efforts to have full reproductive control over American women, and gauging how much the American public is willing to tolerate. It is unclear whether Smith’s baby will survive, and according to the family, Emory University Hospital is keeping her on life support because the hospital is afraid of contravening Georgia law. Meanwhile, state lawmakers and abortion rights opponents have put their hands up and don’t want to be associated with the optics of this tragic mess. In a mid-May press release, the Georgia attorney general’s office clarified that the state’s anti-abortion law does not require Smith be kept alive. “There is nothing in the Life Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” the statement reads. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.” So who is responsible for this? And are we to believe that Georgia lawmakers are powerless to stop this hospital’s apparent misreading of the state’s own rules? Even if the latter were the case, the damage from conservatives’ anti-abortion crusades and the ensuing legislative crackdown has already been done. Hospitals such as Emory have no incentive to weigh the ethical implications of their actions because they have the spirit of the law to consider, regardless of how lawmakers try to play semantic tricks to get around their own culpability. When it comes to public opinion, some have argued in favor of this nightmare based on the fact that Smith is brain dead, and so keeping her alive doesn’t actually “harm” her. What’s next? Women in comas being impregnated because … why not? Vulnerable women being lobotomized and used as incubators? Should the state be able to forcefully impregnate every woman whose body is capable of carrying a baby? Where does it stop? Meanwhile, all the conservative posturing over the sanctity of human life is easily dismantled when you consider the fact that banning abortions effectively issues a death sentence to any pregnant person who is at risk. And what about the issues that took Smith to the hospital to begin with? Her family says she went to see doctors at around eight weeks pregnant with intense headaches, and received medication the same day. The next day, she woke up gasping for air, and was rushed back to the hospital where doctors discovered blood clots in her brain. Smith was declared brain dead shortly after. Black women are the most likely to die during childbirth, are most likely to experience pregnancy-related complications and regularly see their issues dismissed and minimized when they seek help. Was Smith’s life not valuable when she was here? Why is the body of a brain dead woman receiving more care than she did when she was alive? Stories like Smith’s are also a grim reminder of how desperate society is right now to reduce women to their reproductive capacity. From draconian laws that force women to endure life-threatening pregnancies, to the trad-wife and pronatalism renaissance, it’s clear that women’s ability or willingness to carry babies is the political and ethical lightning rod of our time, and the “life” of a foetus has become a convenient tool to wield in the efforts to control women’s bodies. But Black women have always known this. And Smith’s story is deeply triggering for a demographic that has not only seen the worst of what childbearing in the US medical system is like, but also has a history of being used as test dummies for gynaecological experimentation. “We didn’t have a choice or a say about it,” Smith’s mother, April Newkirk, said. “We want the baby. That’s a part of my daughter. But the decision should have been left to us – not the state.” It should go without saying that a person’s agency should be respected whether they’re conscious or not, but we’ve gotten so used to seeing women’s bodies as a means to a political or economic end that ideas like this no longer register as what they are – utterly unconscionable.

"abortion","Kamala Harris says Trump ‘guilty’ of ‘stealing’ abortion rights at rally – as it happened","Democrats went on the attack as they marked the second anniversary of the Dobbs decision, in which the supreme court’s conservative justices overturned the constitutional protections on abortion guaranteed by Roe v Wade. At a speech near Washington DC, Kamala Harris said Donald Trump was “guilty” of “stealing” reproductive rights from American women with his appointment of three of the justices who supported doing away with the precedent. Joe Biden, who is days away from his Thursday presidential debate with Trump, called his predecessor the “sole person responsible for this nightmare”. Meanwhile, neither Trump nor any top Republicans in Congress said anything about the anniversary of the court’s decision. Here’s what else happened today: Trump plans to rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, the day after his debate with Biden. His campaign believes the state is winnable in November, even though it voted overwhelmingly for Biden in 2020. The supreme court will hear a challenge brought by the Biden administration against state-level bans on gender-affirming care for minors … … but first it will release decisions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, almost certainly on at least some of the high-profile cases the justices have yet to decide. The fall of Roe upended life for aspiring doctors who hoped to provide abortions. A top White House official signaled that Biden supports an effort by Senate Democrats to repeal the Comstock Act, a 19th-century law that a second Trump administration might use to ban abortion nationwide. Meanwhile, in Florida, the judge handling Donald Trump’s stalled prosecution over the classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort is in the midst of a major hearing that could determing the case’s trajectory. Here’s the latest on what the two sides are arguing, from the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell: The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump’s prosecution for retaining classified documents is expected on Monday to consider modifying his conditions of release to include a prohibition on making statements that could endanger the safety of FBI agents involved in the case. The request to the US district judge, Aileen Cannon – the first time prosecutors have sought to limit Trump’ public remarks in this case – raises the stakes for Trump. Unlike in his other cases, where prosecutors sought gag orders, a violation of release conditions carries a risk of jail. The latest dispute over Trump’s inflammatory statements stems from his blatantly false characterization of the FBI’s use-of-deadly force policy when they executed a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago club in August 2022 and retrieved more than 100 classified documents. The order, which limits FBI agents to use deadly force only if they face extreme danger and became public after the FBI’s operational plan for the search was unsealed, used standard language that is routinely used in hundreds of warrants executed across the country. But Trump and some allies twisted the limiting language to claim the FBI was authorized by the Biden administration to shoot him when they searched Mar-a-Lago, even though Trump was not there during the search and the language is standard US justice department policy. The supreme court has indicated that the justices may release more decisions on Thursday and Friday, as several politically weighty cases await rulings. The justices were already expected to issue decisions on Wednesday, thus bringing to three the number of days this week that we can expect to hear from the court. The conservative-dominated body has a bunch of matters outstanding, which touch on everything from Donald Trump’s legal fate, to the scope of government regulation. Here are a few: Trump’s petition for immunity from the federal charges brought against him by special prosecutor Jack Smith for attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Where the Biden administration can require federally funded hospitals to perform emergency abortions, even in states like Idaho, which the case centers on, that have strict abortion bans. A challenge to a longstanding doctrine underpinning many federal regulatory decisions. Whether municipalities can make it illegal for people to sleep outside, even when there is insufficient shelter space, in a case that could upend homeless policies nationwide. Decisions on some, all, or theoretically none of these cases could come before the end of the week. Donald Trump and Joe Biden will hold the first of two debates they have scheduled on Thursday. The day after, the former president is scheduled to hold a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, a state that Biden won overwhelmingly in 2020, but which Trump’s campaign argues is within his grasp this year. Trump will “speak with the people of Virginia about how he will reverse the devastating effects of Joe Biden’s failed presidency,” his campaign announced. “President Trump will ease the financial pressures placed on households and re-establish law and order in this country! We can Make America Great Again by tackling lawlessness head-on, ceasing the endless flow of illegal immigrants across our southern border, and reversing the detrimental effects of inflation by restoring people’s wealth.” Polls have lately showed a close, perhaps tied, race between Trump and Biden in Virginia, though there have been none released so far showing the former president with the advantage. Democrats are continuing to press their message against Republicans over their support for the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v Wade, and allowed states to ban abortions. “Two years ago, the extreme right-wing Supreme Court majority issued one of the most egregious rulings in our nation’s history,” the Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said. Here’s more: The Dobbs decision undermined reproductive freedom for women all across America as part of the extreme MAGA Republican plan to criminalize reproductive health care, outlaw contraception and march us toward a nationwide abortion ban. The decision by the out of control Supreme Court majority to take away the long-held right to an abortion represents an assault on freedom, the Constitution and the values shared by a majority of Americans. House Democrats will continue to fight until reproductive freedom is the law of the land and the extreme MAGA Republican effort to impose a nationwide abortion ban is crushed. Still not a peep from Donald Trump and most leading Republicans on the second anniversary of Roe v Wade’s overturning, but that’s not stopping the Biden campaign. Their official account has spent the day tweeting out past instances where Trump has taken credit for orchestrating the downfall of the precedent, which prevented the sorts of abortion restrictions now commonplace in Republican-controlled states. From his town hall in Iowa earlier this year: And what appears to be one of the many videos Trump has posted on his Truth Social account: Former Maryland governor Larry Hogan, the GOP nominee for a Senate seat in the state, was one of the few Republicans to mark the second anniversary of the US supreme court ruling that overturned Roe v Wade. Hogan, in a statement shared by the Washington Post, said that if elected, he would work on bipartisan legislation to “codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.” He noted that as governor, he “reaffirmed my commitment to uphold Maryland law protecting access to abortion,” adding that he was “proud to make Maryland the first state in America to provide over-the-counter birth control covered by insurance.” Hogan, who last week tried to reject Donald Trump’s endorsement in his Senate race, also promised to protect women’s reproductive rights. “A woman’s health care decisions are her own,” he said. Whether it be the decision to start a family with the help of IVF, or exercise her reproductive rights, nothing and no one — especially partisan politics — should come between a woman and her doctor. Planned Parenthood will spend $40m ahead of November’s elections to bolster Joe Biden and leading congressional Democrats. The group will initially target eight states: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, where Biden is seeking to defend 2020 victories, as well as North Carolina, which the Biden campaign to flip, and Montana, New Hampshire and New York, which have races that could help determine control of the Senate and House, it told Associated Press. Jenny Lawson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said: Abortion will be the message of this election, and it will be how we energize voters. It will be what enables us to win. A six-week abortion ban in Texas was linked to a 13% increase in the number of infants who died in their first year of life, a new study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics suggests. The study, published two years to the day since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade and permitted more than a dozen states across the country to outlaw almost all abortions, is one of the first glimpses into how strict abortion bans impact babies’ health. The study also estimated that the ban may have led the number of infants in Texas who died within their first month of life to rise more than 10%. Because Texas enacted its six-week abortion ban in September 2021, months before Roe’s demise, scholars have studied what has happened in Texas for clues about how post-Roe abortion bans are now affecting the rest of the nation. Some of the researchers involved in the Monday study have previously concluded that the Texas ban also led to 10,000 additional births. The study found a 23% jump in infant deaths due to congenital anomalies – the kind of conditions that are often identified in utero and lead to abortions in states where the procedure is legal, since they can be incompatible with life. But that choice is no longer available to pregnant Texans. Two hundred and sixteen more infant deaths occurred due to the Texas six-week abortion ban, the researchers estimated. Kamala Harris has warned that abortion bans in states across the country are cutting women off from essential reproductive care and causing a “health care crisis”, In an interview with MSNBC aired today alongside reproductive rights advocate Hadley Duvall, Harris reflected on her experience visiting a reproductive care clinic in Minnesota in March. In those clinics that are trusted in the community, there is — you can get a Pap [smear] ... breast cancer screening, HIV screening, the things that where people want to be able to walk into a health care facility and be treated with dignity and without judgment so they can address their health care concerns. She continued: That’s what these clinics do. And in states where they have passed these Trump abortion bans, these clinics are closing, which means that there is a reduction of very essential health care across the board for a lot of people. Democrats are on the attack as they mark the second anniversary of the Dobbs decision, in which the supreme court’s conservative justices overturned the constitutional protections on abortion guaranteed by Roe v Wade. At a speech outside Washington DC, Kamala Harris said Donald Trump was “guilty” of “stealing” reproductive rights from American women with his appointment of three of the justices who supported doing away with the precedent. Joe Biden, who is three days away from his Thursday presidential debate with Trump, called his predecessor the “sole person responsible for this nightmare”. Meanwhile, neither Trump nor any top Republicans in Congress have said anything about the anniversary of the court’s decision. Here’s what else has happened today so far: The supreme court will hear a challenge brought by the Biden administration against state-level bans on gender-affirming care for minors. The fall of Roe upended life for aspiring doctors who hoped to provide abortions. A top White House official signaled that Biden supports an effort by Senate Democrats to repeal the Comstock Act, a 19th-century law that a second Trump administration might use to ban abortion nationwide. Kate Cox, the Texas mother who was denied an abortion under the state’s near-total ban last year, introduced Kamala Harris at her speech in Maryland. “Every minute that I stayed pregnant, the risk to my health and to a future pregnancy were growing,” Cox said. “My state chose to drive me out of my home, my community, away from my children and my doctors, rather than to let me access care,” she said, adding: “I never imagined having to fight for something so basic as a procedure to save my health.” As a young student and mother “just trying to stay afloat,” Cox said she didn’t always make time to vote. “I will never again miss an opportunity to vote. I will cast my ballot in every election like my life depends on it,” Cox said. Growing emotional, Cox then shared that she is pregnant again, expecting a child in January. The crowd erupted in applause, as many stood to cheer for her. “And I hope that by then, when we welcome our baby into the world, we will have a world led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” she said. She then welcomed Harris on to the stage as a “champion of the cause” for reproductive freedom. “You are a hero of this movement,” Harris told Cox. Harris emphasized the importance of turning out to vote in November to protect abortion access so that places like Maryland remain havens for reproductive healthcare. Pointing to the statistic that one-in-three American women live in a state with abortion restrictions, she said: “Today our daughters know fewer rights than their grandmothers. This is a healthcare crisis, and we all know who to blame: Donald Trump.” Making her case that Trump was “guilty” of stripping abortion access, which was previewed by the campaign before her appearance, Harris said Trump appointed three supreme court justices with the intention of overturning Roe v Wade. “It was premeditated,” Harris said from a stage, where a sign that said “Trust Women” hung behind her. “Trump has not denied, much less shown remorse, for his actions,” she added. Later this afternoon, Harris will go to battleground state Arizona for a second event marking the Dobbs anniversary. Harris took the stage to chants of “four more years.” She then said Trump was “guilty” in “the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America”, and went on to lay out what she said are the stakes for abortion access if Trump is re-elected. “Understand as much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term will be even worse,” she said. “His friends in the United States Congress are trying to pass a national ban that would outlaw abortion in every single state in states like New York and California, and even right here in Maryland.” She called Republicans who have passed state-level bans Trump’s “accomplices”, and said voters shouldn’t be fooled by Trump’s wavering on abortion, but should focus on what he has said. And she warned that he would go even further, curtailing access to contraception and IVF. “If there were a second Trump term, he has admitted that he is ‘looking at restrictions on contraception,’” she said. “And pay close attention to how his friends in the United States Senate obstructed a bill to protect the right to contraception, not once, not twice, but three times.” Vice President Kamala Harris just took the stage to address a crowd at the University of Maryland, her first event of the day to mark the second anniversary of the Dobbs decision. Maryland is a deep-blue state with an abortion referendum on the ballot and a surprisingly competitive Senate race that could help determine the balance of power in Congress. Ahead of Harris’s remarks, Maryland Democrats and reproductive rights leaders emphasized the stakes in November. Angela Alsobrooks, the Democratic nominee for the state’s open seat, said Trump was “proud as a peacock” for setting in motion the fall of Roe, and warned that Republicans saw the state as an opportunity to win back control of the chamber. Speaking before Harris, she said of Republicans: “Make no mistake about it. They would take the first opportunity to ban abortion nationwide.” Alsobrooks faces Larry Hogan, the state’s former two-term Republican governor, who, in a sign of the fast-shifting politics of abortion, has recast himself as “pro-choice” and said he supports the state’s abortion referendum. Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, urged voters who want to protect access to abortion to send Alsobrooks with him to the Senate. “Larry Hogan’s undergoing some election year conversion like none other I’ve ever seen,” the senator said, pointing to Hogan’s record as governor, when he vetoed a law that would have expanded abortion access. “A vote for Larry Hogan is a vote to put the Maga Republicans in charge of the United States Senate.” In November, Maryland voters will decide whether to approve a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to abortion and “reproductive freedom,” in the state’s constitution. It is widely expected to pass because of broad support for protecting abortion access, which is legal in the state. Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, called it a “solemn anniversary” but said there was also reason to hope. “We poured the pain that we felt into action,” she said. “Election after election, voters showed up motivated by that grief by that pain, but also by that anger and they sent Maga extremists packing.” Kamala Harris is holding a rally in Washington DC’s Maryland suburbs to mark two years since the supreme court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned constitutional protections on abortion. In excerpts of the speech shared by the White House, the vice-president will accuse Donald Trump of “stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America”. “This is a health care crisis, and we know who is to blame: Donald Trump. How do we know? Well, I’m a former prosecutor. So let’s look at the facts. Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe. So it was premeditated,” Harris will say. Here’s more: Trump has not denied, much less shown remorse, for his actions. Instead, he proudly takes credit for overturning Roe. In a court of law, that would be called an admission. Some would say, a confession. … In the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America, Donald Trump is guilty. The end of Roe v Wade, and moves by Republican-controlled states to ban abortion, have made life particularly complicated for women on probation and parole, according to recently published research. From the Guardian’s Jessica Glenza: The number of women on probation or parole who must seek permission to travel for an abortion more than doubled to 635,000 in two years since the supreme court overturned the federal right to abortion, a new report finds. Fourteen states have near-total abortion bans and 21 restrict the procedure. Together with near ubiquitous travel restrictions imposed by probation and parole, more than half of women on probation or parole in the US must seek permission to travel before obtaining an abortion. The policies are a “one-two punch” for women caught in the criminal justice system, the report’s author said. “Doing the math I was shocked it was so many,” said Wendy Sawyer, research director at the Prison Policy Initiative, which published the new report. The research came just ahead of today – the second anniversary of the Dobbs decision, which the supreme court used to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022. “An additional 400,000 women is a lot of additional women to be put in this very precarious situation,” she said. Beyond its massive impact in American politics, the Guardian’s Carter Sherman reports that the fall of Roe v Wade upended the education of aspiring doctors who were looking to provide abortions: The fall of Roe v Wade upended Dr Jasmine Chan’s career. As a medical student, the Texas native wanted to provide abortions as an OB-GYN. But in 2022, as Chan prepared to apply for residency – a kind of years-long apprenticeship after medical school – she worried that the quirks of the residency placement process would keep her in Texas, which banned abortions after the US supreme court overturned Roe. “I met with my advisers and I had very strong heart-to-heart conversations about how I couldn’t see myself practicing medicine if it didn’t include me getting to do abortions,” Chan said. Instead of becoming an OB-GYN, she decided to become a family medicine doctor – a less competitive specialty that increased her chances of finding a residency in a state that protects abortion access. Now, two years into her residency program in New Jersey, Chan is preparing to finally get the training that she’s longed for her entire career. But, like many other doctors seeking abortion training after Roe’s demise, she will still have to overcome hurdles that didn’t exist just two years ago. Joe Biden and his allies have seized on the second anniversary of the supreme court’s Dobbs ruling to attack Donald Trump and his allies as threats to reproductive freedom. And, so far today, the GOP is not saying much back. Trump’s feed on Truth Social is full of posts about his rally in Philadelphia this weekend, with not a peep about the overturning of Roe v Wade, or his role in it. Meanwhile, top Republican officials in Congress, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and speaker of the House Mike Johnson, have not commented either, nor has Lindsey Graham, who has introduced legislation to ban abortion nationwide. That could change in the course of the day. However, veteran anti-abortion groups are marking the occasion, with warnings that a second Biden term could lead to the re-establishment of nationwide access to the procedure. Here’s Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America: In the ongoing call with reporters marking the two-year anniversary of the Dobbs decision, the director of the White House’s gender policy council Jennifer Klein signaled that Joe Biden supports efforts in Congress to repeal the Comstock Act. That is the obscenity law passed in 1873 that remains on the books, and which productive rights advocates fear could be used by a second Trump administration to ban abortion nationwide. “We support all actions by Democrats in Congress to protect reproductive freedom, including this one, and the president has been quite clear that what we need, ultimately, is a federal law restoring the protections of Roe v Wade, which is the only way we can ensure that women in every state are going to be able to make the decisions that are right for them and their families, to stop the erosion of reproductive rights that we are seeing across the country, and to stop the other side from attempting to roll us back to the 1800s,” Klein said. She also noted that though Biden’s justice department does not believe Comstock could be used to outlaw abortion by criminalizing the mailing and transportation of material used in the procedure, officials in a second Trump administration could reverse that: Our department of justice has issued a binding opinion that Comstock is not a barrier to the shipment, the mailing, the transport, for lawful purposes, for lawful abortion. And so their view, the other side’s view, is draconian and inconsistent with longstanding interpretation of the Comstock Act by courts for decades … and they’ve been quite clear what a future administration could and would do. They would use Comstock to go after the mailing of abortion medication and even potentially other supplies used in abortion. And they’ve been quite clear that, you know, that’s why they don’t think they need to pass a national abortion ban … They’ve got a backdoor ban on the books. Last week, Democratic senator Tina Smith introduced legislation to repeal the Comstock Act: In a call with reporters, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre hit out Republicans for their efforts to ban abortion, and accused them of moving to curb access to in vitro fertilization treatment, and contraception. “Two years ago today, the Supreme Court overturned a woman’s constitutional right to make deeply Personal health care decisions free from the interference of politicians. The aftermath has been devastating for women’s health and lives,” Jean-Pierre said. She continued: Already this year, Republican elected officials and states have filed more than 300 bills to restrict access to abortion care. And, on Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans have proposed three national abortion bans, and, despite having had every opportunity to protect reproductive freedom since the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe, Republican officials have blocked attempts led by Democratic elected officials and refused to do so. Just earlier this month, Senate Republicans once again refused to protect access to IVF for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant, and Republicans in Congress blocked a bill that would protect a woman’s right to access contraception. It’s extreme, it’s out of touch, and it’s wrong … This should never happen in America. The supreme court has agreed to hear a challenge brought by the Biden administration against Republican-backed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, the Associated Press reports. The case will be heard in the court’s forthcoming term, with arguments expected later this year. Conservatives hold a supermajority of seats on the high court, and the petition gives them the opportunity to issue a ruling that could green-light such bans nationwide. Here’s more, from the AP: The justices’ action comes as Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people, including a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students. The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati allowed laws in Tennessee and Kentucky to take effect after they had been blocked by lower courts. (The high court did not act on a separate appeal from Kentucky.) “Without this Court’s prompt intervention, transgender youth and their families will remain in limbo, uncertain of whether and where they can access needed medical care,” lawyers for the transgender teens in Tennessee told the justices. Actor Elliot Page, the Oscar-nominated star of “Juno,” “Inception” and “The Umbrella Academy,” was among 57 transgender people who joined a legal filing in support of Supreme Court review. Arguments will take place in the fall. Last week, South Carolina became the 25th state to adopt a law restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, even though such treatments have been available in the United States for more than a decade and are endorsed by major medical associations. Joe Biden has marked the second anniversary of the supreme court’s Dobbs decision by issuing a statement reminding voters of Donald Trump’s involvement in the ruling, which gave state the green-light to ban abortion. Since then, 14 states have implemented total abortion bans, and 27 others have banned the procedure after a certain number of weeks of gestation, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In his statement, Biden described the situation as a “nightmare” that can only be blamed on Trump: Donald Trump is the sole person responsible for this nightmare. For him, these cruel state bans are a ‘beautiful thing to watch’ – and they’re just beginning. This is a man who brags about overturning Roe v. Wade, has called for women who access reproductive health care to be punished — and says he would rule as a dictator on day one. If given the chance, there is no question he will ban abortion nationwide, with or without the help of Congress. You don’t have to take my word for it – his advisors have already laid out the plans to do it. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Today is the two-year anniversary of the supreme court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned the 49-year-old precedent set in Roe v Wade and allowed states to ban abortion. Since then, abortion rights advocates have succeeded in getting voters to approve measures protecting access to the procedure in states as conservative as Kansas and Ohio, while Democratic candidates across the country have campaigned on reproductive rights to win office. Now, the party is looking to continue that momentum going into the November presidential election, with an eye towards focusing the ire of pro-abortion rights voters on Donald Trump – who appointed to the court three of the justices that supported the Dobbs decision. “Two years ago today, Donald Trump’s supreme court majority ripped away the fundamental freedom for women to access the health care they need and deserve,” Joe Biden said in a statement released this morning to mark the occasion. While he remains ensconced at the Camp David presidential retreat ahead of Thursday’s debate with Trump, Kamala Harris will hold a campaign event today in Maryland, where she’ll no doubt address the issue. Here’s what else is going on today: Trump continued his tactic of campaigning in inner cities over the weekend, holding his first rally in Philadelphia with a speech that focused on blaming undocumented migrants for crime, facts be damned. Same-sex marriage, which is protected by a supreme court ruling and also by a recently passed federal law, remains broadly popular, though its support is slipping among Republicans, Gallup finds in a new poll. Neither the House nor Senate are in session today, but the lower chamber will be back tomorrow, with its Republican majority focused on passing spending bills that will likely contain a number of rightwing demands to be used as bargaining chips with the Democrats.","2024-06-24T20:00:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jun/24/biden-trump-debate-abortion-roe-updates"
"abortion","US doctors struggle to get basic abortion training two years after fall of Roe","The fall of Roe v Wade upended Dr Jasmine Chan’s career. As a medical student, the Texas native wanted to provide abortions as an OB-GYN. But in 2022, as Chan prepared to apply for residency – a kind of years-long apprenticeship after medical school – she worried that the quirks of the residency placement process would keep her in Texas, which banned abortions after the US supreme court overturned Roe. “I met with my advisers and I had very strong heart-to-heart conversations about how I couldn’t see myself practicing medicine if it didn’t include me getting to do abortions,” Chan said. Instead of becoming an OB-GYN, she decided to become a family medicine doctor – a less competitive specialty that increased her chances of finding a residency in a state that protects abortion access. Now, two years into her residency program in New Jersey, Chan is preparing to finally get the training that she’s longed for her entire career. But, like many other doctors seeking abortion training after Roe’s demise, she will still have to overcome hurdles that didn’t exist just two years ago. Over the next few months, Chan will pursue abortion training in two different clinics, the closest of which is three hours away, on top of her day job. In the fall, she’ll need to relocate entirely for training at a third clinic. She’ll have to jump through all of those hoops because there just aren’t enough clinics left to train the US’s future doctors in a relatively quick, straightforward procedure that one in four women will undergo at some point in their lives. When the US supreme court overturned Roe exactly two years ago, it paved the way for more than a dozen states to outlaw almost all abortions. It also plunged the American medical training system into chaos. Because many hospitals have long refused to perform most abortions, residents who want to learn the procedure have often received their training at abortion clinics. But now that bans have shuttered so many clinics, there are just not enough facilities to train all the residents. “Clinical training sites are overburdened just trying to meet patient need, which makes it far less likely that they will accept as many trainees or for as many days as they used to,” said Latona Giwa, executive director of the Midwest Access Project, a non-profit that helps a range of healthcare professionals receive reproductive healthcare training, including abortion instruction. But if they don’t, she said, “we will not have a next generation of abortion providers.” Doctors across the country already say that abortion bans have forced them to delay care for pregnant women in medical emergencies. But as abortion training becomes more scarce, or accessible only to doctors such as Chan who have time and money to clear a logistical obstacle course, fewer doctors will have the skills to handle dangerous pregnancy complications, including miscarriages, which are often treated with the same procedures used in abortions. Abortion training may soon become even harder to access. Project 2025, a playbook written by the influential thinktank the Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Donald Trump administration, recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services “ensure that training for medical professionals (doctors, nurses, etc) and doulas is not being used for abortion training”. Project 2025 also recommends penalizing institutions that don’t make it easier for medical professionals to opt out of abortion training on conscience grounds. Although the language is ambiguous, enforcing it could ultimately lead to the prohibition or even criminalization of abortion training, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the legal history of reproduction. “It sounds like, ideally, they want to defund or essentially have like a Hyde amendment for any kind of federal support, whether direct or indirect, for training,” said Ziegler, referring to a nationwide rule that bans the use of federal dollars for abortions. Residency programs and medical schools, like virtually all US educational institutions, take money from the federal government. ‘It is just so siloed’ It has never been exactly easy for American doctors to learn how to perform abortions. The hospital systems that run medical schools and residency programs are deeply hierarchical institutions that rely on public dollars – and so they tend to steer clear of issues as controversial as abortion. In 1992, two decades after the US supreme court first decided Roe, only 12% of OB-GYN residency programs routinely offered training in abortion. Three years later, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education decided, for the first time, to mandate that OB-GYN residency programs teach doctors how to perform abortions. Still, as of 2018, just 64% OB-GYN residencies offered routine, dedicated abortion training. Meanwhile, hospitals provided just 3% of all abortions – and, usually, only in high-risk pregnancies or cases of fetal anomalies. That left the burden of training to abortion clinics. To help close the gap, a national initiative called the Ryan Residency Training Program (RRTP) helps place OB-GYN residents with clinics for training. In 2021, when Texas enacted a six-week abortion ban, the RRTP stepped up to help residents travel out of state for abortion training. But the process turned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare, as programs and clinics struggled to secure the right paperwork and legal clearances. “Oh my God, it took six months before even the first resident could travel,” said Dr Jody Steinauer, who leads the RRTP. “That’s how hard it is to set these up.” After Roe fell, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education announced that it would mandate OB-GYN programs to either offer residents training in abortion or send them to states where they can get it. However, a spokesperson for the council declined to say how many OB-GYN programs currently met that requirement. There are now nearly 1,300 OB-GYN residents living and working in states with near-total abortion bans – all of whom must travel out of state for hands-on training in abortion. The RRTP has helped 16 programs in states with abortion bans set up partnerships to help residents travel out of state for training. States with abortion bans, which tend to have among the highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in the nation, are now facing a worsening OB-GYN shortage. Fewer OB-GYNs are even applying to residency programs in those states. Louisiana, for example, saw a 17% drop; Alabama saw a 21% drop; Missouri, 25%. Alongside OB-GYNs, family medicine doctors are the specialists most likely to learn how to perform abortions. But they aren’t required to complete that training – and the ones who want it, even in blue states, can’t necessarily acquire it. “There’s just a lot more competition for training spots,” said Erica Chong, executive director of the Reproductive Health Education in Family Medicine (Rhedi) program, the family medicine version of the RRTP. Dr Amy Hoffman is a family medicine resident in Pennsylvania, a state that permits abortions. But although her institution supports her desire to learn to provide abortions, it does not have any faculty with the skills to teach her. At this point in her residency, she’s doubtful that she’ll get the training. “I have to find a month where I can leave my residency and give myself months and months ahead of planning to get the medical agreements in place,” Hoffman said. Her day job is already arduous enough. Residency programs are permitted to require residents to work up to 80 hours a week; they can also make them work 28-hour shifts. “Every doctor in every specialty has seen a caesarean or seen an appendectomy or taken care of diabetes, but the majority of doctors have never seen abortion care and never seen the procedure performed,” Hoffman said. “It is just so siloed and inaccessible to patients and learners alike.” A jump in interest Advocates across the medical training field are thrilled that, since Roe fell, so many new providers want to get trained in abortion. A handful of new residency programs have already joined the Rhedi program. Steinauer said that there is now “a lot more collaboration, within states, within regions, nationally” between institutions looking to bulk up their abortion training. The Midwest Access Project received nearly 50 applications in its first application cycle after Roe’s downfall. At the time, that was the most it had ever received. Now the non-profit receives somewhere between 100 and 200 applications each cycle. It’s still only able to accept about 50 people each cycle, but it gives Giwa hope. “That’s a huge number of great impact, because every time one abortion-trained provider is added to a community or region, a state, they can train tenfold providers and they can do it in a primary care setting, ideally,” Giwa said. She envisions a future in which “you can just go get your allergy medicine and your abortion pills from the same person, and it’s not this huge extra ordeal”.","2024-06-24T11:00:27Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/24/abortion-training-doctors-ban-roe"
"abortion","New Liberal candidate for Whitlam claimed ‘Marxist brainwashing’ happening at Australian schools","The new Liberal candidate for the seat of Whitlam once claimed school students were being “brainwashed” by Marxist and woke ideologies. Nathaniel Smith, a former MP for the NSW seat of Wollondilly, replaces another candidate dumped by the party for his controversial views. The party’s New South Wales branch administrative committee confirmed on Sunday Benjamin Britton had been disendorsed after Guardian Australia revealed a string of controversial views on fringe podcasts last year, including that women should be banned from frontline roles in the military and that the education system was “indoctrinating” young Australians about Marxist ideologies. A Liberal party spokesperson said Britton had been dumped for “views expressed which were not previously disclosed and are inconsistent with the party’s position”, with Smith confirmed as his replacement. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The new candidate, a member of the party’s religious conservative faction, held Wollondilly between 2019 and 2023 under the NSW Liberal government before he was ousted by an independent challenger. Smith’s maiden speech outlined his views on “political correctness” and “Marxist brainwashing” of school students. “Political correctness in this country has gone too far,” Smith said in May 2019. “We saw a war on the coal industry just to appeal to the latte-sipping lefties who live in inner-city seats, with no regard for regional areas such as my electorate. “I believe childhood is a period of innocence. I want to see schools teach core skills, not agendas. I want my children to learn about history, geography, mathematics, western civilisation, science and the arts; not Safe Schools, gender fluidity and other forms of Marxist brainwashing.” Smith said Australians needed to “recognise”, “embrace” and maintain Judeo-Christian history in school curriculums. In response to questions from Guardian Australia about whether he still held these views, Smith said he advocated for “better education standards for our kids”. “Australia’s school students are falling further behind their international peers, while the Labor government is encouraging activism rather than making commonsense improvements to the school curriculum,” he said. “A Liberal government will help get our education system back to basics by focusing on explicit instruction and other evidence-based teaching methods which prioritise reading, writing, maths and science.” In 2019 the then-southern highlands MP visited a Melbourne rally against abortion, hosted by Bernie Finn, amid fierce debate over a bill to decriminalise abortion in NSW. At an August 2019 anti-abortion rally, Smith said abortion should not be decriminalised. “This is not an issue like a hip replacement, a nose job, a fake tan – this is a human being,” he said at the time. “This will not protect women, this should not be going into the Health Care Act, it should remain in the Crimes Act.” Smith’s interests include preserving Australia’s reliance on gas. Asic records show Smith was appointed director of a pro-gas interests group, co-directed by the chief executive of a Beetaloo Basin gas company, just a month before he was announced as the Liberal’s last-minute replacement in Whitlam. Smith, who is also the chief executive of Master Plumbers NSW, joined Australians for Natural Gas as one of its three directors in March, Asic records show. Smith said his role at both organisations allowed him to engage in industry debates and education on “the vital role gas plays in meeting the energy needs of businesses and households”. “I make no apologies for standing up for the need to have more Australian gas for Australians,” Smith told Guardian Australia. The group describes itself as a “not-for-profit organisation representing the interests of Aussie households, industries, and producers” and supports the “expanded production and continued use of Australia’s abundant reserves of natural gas”. Candidates are not precluded from holding directorships. The group also lists the chief executive for Tamboran Resources, Joel Riddle, as one of its directors. The US company Tamboran Resources has gas operations in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo basin between Katherine and Tennant Creek. Last year the company signed a nine-year deal to sell the NT government fracked gas, beginning in 2026, with an option to extend the deal for a further six years to 2042. The deal was announced close to a year after the NT government said production could commence in the Beetaloo basin, despite science and energy agencies warning there can be no more exploitation of new oil, gas and coalfields if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C. In a social media post in December last year, Smith shared a pro-nuclear post, writing “it’s coming. Get ready for it” using hashtags, “don’t question the science” and “until then, gas and coal are king”. Lyndal Maloney, a former adviser for the conservative political group CPAC is also listed as a director for Australians for Natural Gas.","2025-04-08T13:30:27Z","https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/08/new-liberal-candidate-for-whitlam-claimed-marxist-brainwashing-happening-at-australian-schools-ntwnfb"
"abortion","Abortion restrictions tied to higher rates of intimate partner homicide, says study","A new study finds abortion restrictions may be associated with increased rates of intimate partner homicide among reproductive-aged women and girls. Notably, the study looks at the period before the US supreme court overturned the national right to abortion in 2022, when states could restrict – but not outlaw – abortion. Fourteen states have since banned the procedure. As a result, the dynamics identified in the research may in fact be significantly exacerbated, even if they are not yet reflected in the data. Even though intimate partner homicide is relatively rare, “it is consistently among the leading causes of death in pregnant and postpartum people,” said Maeve Wallace, an associate professor at Tulane University in Louisiana, and a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist who led the study. The report was published as a research letter in the journal Health Affairs. Other studies have found that women and girls often seek abortions to leave abusive relationships or avoid bringing children into abusive relationships. “In thinking about pregnancy itself as a risk factor for homicide, it follows that the ability to prevent or end a pregnancy” could have “immediate implications” for women’s safety, said Wallace. Researchers conducted the study by looking at five separate abortion restrictions – all laws designed to restrict abortion access without improving patient safety – and the rates reported in the National Violent Death Reporting System maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors of the study then controlled for a variety of factors known to affect the rate of intimate partner violence – including income inequality, gun ownership and even party control of the state legislature. Researchers also expanded the typical definition of “reproductive-aged” to include girls as young as 10. They did this based on case reports of girls as young as 13 experiencing intimate or familial violence and analyzed the years 2014 to 2020, which represents the most recent available data. For each of the five studied abortion restrictions, the rate of intimate partner homicide among girls and women ages 10 to 44 years old increased 3.4%, researches found. Extrapolated across the US, that finding could indicate an additional 24 women and girls died of intimate partner homicide during the years covered by the study. The research follows other studies which found Trap restrictions – measures that regulate where abortions may be provided and performed – are also associated with increased risk of suicide among reproductive-aged women. Not every state was included in the analysis. Researchers only included states where 100% of localities reported to the violent deaths database. That ruled out three of the most populous and diverse states in the US – California, Florida and Texas. In total, the analysis captured about 52% of girls and women ages 10 to 44 living in the US. Additionally, because there were very few identified cases of homicide among pregnant and postpartum women, girls and women of reproductive age were effectively a proxy measure for likely pregnant or postpartum victims of violence. Wallace said the research is almost certainly an underestimate of the potential risk to pregnant and postpartum women, because intimate partner violence is generally underreported. Intimate partner homicide is “the super extreme relatively rare outcome”, said Wallace. However, an estimated 41% of women in the US have experienced intimate partner violence, making “the burden … huge”.","2024-05-07T18:53:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/07/abortion-restrictions-domestic-violence-homicide"
"abortion","John Oliver on the ADF legal group: ‘A misleadingly friendly face on what is an utterly hateful ideology’","John Oliver used his perch on Last Week Tonight to look ahead to an upcoming supreme court case over the charter school St Isidore of Seville in Oklahoma, which seeks to become the first religious charter school in the country. If the court rules in its favor, the school would receive public funds for an explicitly Catholic education, marking what Oliver called on Sunday evening “yet another step on the slippery slope of breaking down the establishment clause separating church and state”. The supreme courtwill probably not rule on this particular case until next month, but Oliver trained on the “key group” behind the case: the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). “Even if you don’t recognize their name, you’re familiar with their work,” he explained. In their own words, ADF is “the world’s largest legal organization advancing every person’s God-given right to live and speak the truth”. But as Oliver explained, “the freedom ADF fights for is selective at best.” Among other things, the group had argued for the Christian baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado, orchestrated the attack on the abortion pill mifepristone in the supreme court and was a leader on the Dobbs case that overturned Roe v Wade. Since 2011, the group has represented parties in 15 supreme court wins, and claims victory in 77 cases since its founding, from removing the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act to throwing out a law that provided a protest buffer around abortion clinics. “So they are way more powerful than many are aware,” said Oliver, “and they are using that power for – I’ll say it – bad.” Yet ADF has avoided the notoriety and name recognition of, say, the National Rifle Association (NRA), “which works very much in their favor”, said Oliver, before digging into the group’s history, aims and deflections. Originally called the Alliance Defense Fund, ADF was founded in 1993 by prominent evangelical Christians as an endowment to pay for lawyers to take on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and its ilk. Under Alan Sears, who led the group from its founding until 2017, the ADF argued for state laws criminalizing gay sex and against laws legalizing gay marriage. In his 2003 book The Homosexual Agenda, Sears described gay rights as “the principal threat to religious freedom” and said gay activists were engaged in “a war of propaganda, just as Hitler did so masterfully in Nazi Germany”. “From ADF’s outset, attacking the rights and dignity of gay people was at the center of its work,” Oliver said, “along with rolling back access to abortion and giving Christians more leeway to discriminate against someone who offends their faith. And those ideals have not changed even as the organization has massively grown.” ADF now employs more than 450 people in its domestic and international offices, and boasts nearly 5,000 network attorneys who work on their behalf. The group has a legal scholarship and conference frequently attended by the supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett; Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, worked there for nearly a decade, eventually becoming senior legal counsel. While there, Johnson advocated for the criminalization of gay sex, urged people to “say Christmas!” and wrote op-eds arguing that “homosexual relationships are inherently unnatural”. “That is who they are at their core,” said Oliver. The group has been successful, Oliver argued, partially through the sheer volume of legislation they draft – 107 bills in 24 states in 2024. The Dobbs case that overturned Roe v Wade was modeled on a bill drafted by ADF. And the group sells its desired outcome to the public by “foregrounding sympathetic individuals whose liberty they present as being violated”, Oliver explained. “ADF goes out of its way to craft wholesome stories that present their side as the victims.” Oliver played a clip of ADF’s general counsel, Kristen Waggoner, who said in 2016: “We need to win back culture … And I would say we need to engage and tell the stories in a winsome way.” That “winsome” way, Oliver continued, often meant misrepresenting data and personal experience, including using Waggoner’s daughter to advocate against a fictional trans teen playing softball at a rival school (the suggested teen was in fact not trans). Waggoner argued that cases such as the baker refusing to make cakes for a gay wedding were “about whether the government can use the power of law to force Americans to say things that they don’t believe”. But as Oliver contended: “pretty fucking rich, coming from the same people who brought you saychristmas.org. Say it! You have to say it! “Throughout all of these lawsuits, ADF insisted it was just sticking up for the little guy,” he added. “But for all its careful, ‘winsome’ positioning, it is worth remembering that this is a group that in 2003, filed a brief at the supreme court urging them to uphold state bans on sodomy, has sought to uphold bans on gay sex in India in Belize, which still fights for faith-based adoption agencies who refuse to serve same-sex couples to get public funding, and that right now is fighting to overturn bans on conversion therapy. “Despite what it says, each case ADF brings is in service of their larger worldview,” he continued, “one in which abortion and the rights of gay and trans people are a thing of the past, and they’re going to keep chipping away at those rights all while cheerily telling you that they’re doing so in the service of freedom.” To return to the upcoming court case, ADF insists that the St Isidore school in Oklahoma will not reject any student based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, but it also has a policy that staff will interact with students, faculty and staff “according to their biological sex”. As Oliver noted: “Allowing taxpayer funds to go directly to a school with policies like that feels like we’re moving another step closer of ADF’s ultimate goal of eliminating LGBTQ status as protected class citizens.” As for what can be done, due to the status of the courts, “unfortunately, a lot of this is out of our hands right now,” Oliver concluded. “But I do think at the very least, there’s value in everyone knowing exactly what we are dealing with here. Because at least with the NRA, you understand what its endgame is, as they will happily tell you to your face.” But ADF has “worked extremely hard to put a misleadingly friendly face on what is an utterly hateful ideology”, he said. “And it benefits immensely from people not knowing just how poisonous and disingenuous it is.”","2025-05-12T15:54:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/12/john-oliver-adf"
"abortion","‘Terrified of losing their rights’: abortion is a leading issue for Arizona’s Latino voters","Throughout her political career, Raquel Terán has been advised to avoid talking too much about abortion. “I’ve been told: ‘Be careful speaking about the issue when you’re running in a Latino district,’” said Terán, a congressional candidate in Arizona and former chair of the state’s Democratic party. The conventional political wisdom was that Latino voters – many of whom are religious – opposed abortion access. That has never squared with Terán’s experience. “I go to mass and I believe in a woman’s right to choose,” she said. But during this election cycle – perhaps more than ever before – the issue could be a decisive factor for Latino voters in Arizona. Longtime political operatives, progressive Latino organizers and Latino candidates like Terán say they’ve seen it compel even those who have grown disillusioned by electoral politics. “Abortion has become a top priority for a lot of the people who vote all the time, and also the people who don’t vote all the time,” said Terán. “Because voters are terrified of losing their rights.” This summer, the state supreme court’s reinstatement of an extreme, civil war-era abortion law has fueled support for a November ballot initiative that could enshrine abortion rights. Though lawmakers repealed the law in May, it will remain in effect though the end of June before it is replaced by a 15-week abortion ban. “I have had people running out of the house to sign the petition,” said Alejandra Gomez, the executive director of the progressive group Lucha, which has been collecting endorsements for the ballot initiative. “That has never happened to me before.” Even though the campaign collected enough signatures in April for the measure to appear on the ballot in November, organizers said they would continue to gather support – anticipating legal challenges and audits from Republicans seeking to disqualify the initiative. On a searing afternoon in late May, as the temperatures in the metro Phoenix area began to tip into the triple digits, thousands of volunteers deployed to coffee shops, libraries and local breweries to gather more signatures. Canvassers for Democratic candidates carried Abortion Access for All petitions alongside their normal literature. Enthusiasm for the initiative has surprised even longtime political operatives in the state. Views on abortion within Arizona’s Latino communities can vary widely, especially across generational lines, said Enrique Davis Mazlum, the Arizona state director for UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy group. What many polls have historically failed to capture is that even if voters don’t support abortion personally, they still believe in abortion access. “Even if they are Catholic and might not themselves choose to get an abortion, they don’t want the government to decide for them,” Davis Mazlum said. Polls now indicate that growing majorities of Latino voters support the right to abortion access. Surveys from the Pew Research Center have found that support for abortion access among Hispanic voters nationally has ticked up over the past two decades – from about 47% in 2007-2008 to about 60% in 2022, after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. In Arizona, a 2022 poll by UnidosUS and Mi Familia Vota found that 80% of Latino voters in Arizona agreed or somewhat agreed that abortion should remain legal, regardless of their personal beliefs on the issue. That poll, which was released shortly after the fall of Roe v Wade, captured a moment when voters were especially worried about reproductive rights. The reinstatement of the 1864 near-total abortion ban earlier this year has been another inflection point. “We’ve seen that issue again at the top of mind of a lot of voters and particularly Latino voters,” said Stella Rouse, director of the Hispanic Research Center at Arizona State University. Junelle Cavero Harnal, a Democrat from south Phoenix who was appointed to a vacated seat in Arizona’s House of Representatives just one day before the legislature voted on a repeal of the civil war-era abortion ban, said it was an issue that her constituents have raised on a daily basis. As she campaigns for a full term in a diverse district where more than 80% of her constituents are people of color and about 58% are Latino, she said: “Usually what people want to talk to me about is abortion, the cost of living and the conflict in Israel.” That bore true on a searing weekday evening at the end of May as Cavero Harnal – in a baseball cap and campaign T-shirt – was knocking on doors in her own neighborhood. “I have two daughters and a granddaughter,” one woman volunteered after answering the door. “And all our rights are being taken away.” For Sophia Mendoza, 17 – whose family has known Cavero Harnal for years – the reinstatement of the 1864 ban came as a shock. “I hadn’t even been paying much attention to the news when the ban happened,” said Mendoza. “I talked about it with my mom and sister and my mom brought up the fact that she’s had multiple miscarriages, and how we shouldn’t take away anyone’s right to have or not have children,” chimed in Mendoza’s friend Emily Peña, 18. “It brought up so many feelings” Organizers said they hope the anger voters feel will drive turnout in November. “When we’re at the doors, and we begin to share that President Biden actually supports abortion access, that completely changes the conversation,” Cavero Harna said. Even voters who are disappointed with the president’s progress on the economy or immigration have signalled they would consider voting for Biden. “This is the way that our communities are coming around to entertaining voting for the top of the ticket,” she said. Biden’s campaign appears to have picked up that the issue could be a factor in its favor, coming out with an abortion campaign that targets Latino men. Ads running in Arizona and Nevada feature Cesar Carreon – a carpenter who identifies himself as a marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “I know what tough is,” Carreon says in the ad. “And a guy like Donald Trump that attacks women, takes away their freedom and brags about it? That’s not tough.” He continues: “I’m with Joe Biden, because he’ll give my daughters their freedom back.” It may help Democrats and progressives that voters can also see through Republican efforts to appeal to their community with social conservatism, said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former Democratic state senate leader who has over the decades fought back numerous Republicans’ efforts to erode abortion rights in Arizona. As the abortion access ballot measure gains steam, Republicans have promoted a “Secure the Border” initiative to galvanize conservatives that would empower law enforcement to profile and arrest anyone they suspect might have crossed the border illegally. They’ve also pushed a number of efforts to roll back voting rights. “It’s always amazing to me that the same people who on the one hand are attacking immigrants, attacking us for being here, those same people believe we will support them on the abortion issue,” Gutierrez said. “That’s an aberration that borders on psychosis.” Then again, he said, his community has long supported the right to choose. Back when he was state senate leader, he recalled once squirming in the pews when the priest at his Catholic church spoke on abortion. “He talked about what a sin it was, and how still some members of the church supported it, and I knew he was talking about me,” Gutierrez said. After the sermon, as Gutierrez was eating menudo in the church basement, a group of elder women in the congregation pulled him aside, he recalled: “They said: ‘Don’t listen to that. You’re doing the right thing.’”","2024-06-18T12:00:19Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/18/arizona-abortion-latino-vote"
"abortion","First Thing: Zelenskyy and Vance to meet after Macron warns not to ‘capitulate’ to Russia","Good morning. The US vice-president, JD Vance, is to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and other European leaders in Munich, after widespread criticism of Donald Trump’s statements on Ukraine. Following a phone call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Trump said he believed it was “unlikely” Ukraine would be able to regain much of its territory and he was “OK” with it not joining Nato. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Vance tried to stymie condemnation of Trump for what appeared to be premature and unilateral concessions, saying the US would be willing to impose sanctions on Russia if Moscow did not accept a satisfactory deal and that the option of sending US troops remained on the table. European leaders will put pressure on Vance to involve them in talks over Ukraine’s fate when they meet, stressing that their security is bound to Kyiv’s. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been among those demanding the US be more cautious, saying: “A peace that is a capitulation is bad news for everyone.” What’s the reaction in Ukraine? Anger and betrayal were common emotions among those the Guardian spoke to in Kyiv. Zelenskyy called the Putin-Trump call “unpleasant” – but clearly cognizant of being unable to burn bridges, said the subsequent call he had with Trump was “a very good conversation”. Hamas expected to name Israeli hostages it will free this weekend Hamas is expected on Friday to name three hostages it will release this weekend under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, according to local media, while the Israeli government has signalled it will also stick the deal, after the fragile peace appeared to be close to breaking point this week. The Israeli prime minister’s office on Thursday issued a statement clarifying its expectation for the continuation of the ceasefire. “There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,” the spokesperson David Mencer said. “That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday.” The statement follows nearly three days of confusion after Trump declared that Israel should demand Hamas release all the remaining hostages by Saturday or resume its war. It also comes after Hamas suggested it could delay the release of hostages due to what it said were violations by the Israeli army, before walking back the threat on Thursday. How many hostages remain with Hamas? There are 76 people, though it is unclear how many are still alive. Texas judge fines New York doctor for mailing abortion pills to patient in Texas A Texas judge has ordered a New York doctor to stop mailing abortion pills to patients in Texas and fined her more than $100,000, in a case expected to go to the supreme court. Judge Bryan Gantt of Collin county district court on Thursday ordered Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter of the town of New Paltz in New York state to cease prescribing and mailing the abortion pills. The case, which follows a lawsuit filed by the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, an ally of Trump, challenges the limits of “shield laws”, which were established after the fall of Roe v Wade to protect physicians offering abortions. How did the case come to be? The “biological father of an unborn child” of an alleged patient of Carpenter filed a complaint with the attorney general – a tactic encouraged by anti-abortion groups. In other news … Mexico’s president has accused the US of harboring drug cartels and working with Mexican organized crime, responding to Trump’s claim that her government was in an “intolerable alliance” with traffickers. A federal judge has temporarily halted Trump’s executive order to limit gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth, putting the directive on hold for 14 days. The National Park Service culled all references to trans people from its website for the Stonewall national monument on Thursday, despite the 1969 riot there, which sparked the contemporary gay rights movement, being led by trans women.

"abortion","Trump says Arizona supreme court’s abortion ruling will be ‘straightened out’","Insisting abortion rights should be left to state governments, Donald Trump nonetheless said the rightwing Arizona supreme court went too far when it ruled on Tuesday that a 160-year-old near-total ban could be enforced. “Yeah, they did [go too far],” Trump said on Wednesday to reporters at an airport in Atlanta, Georgia. “That’ll be straightened out, and as you know it’s all about states’ rights.” Only on Monday, a day before the Arizona court said the 1864 ban could go into effect, Trump issued a lengthy statement seeking to stake out his position on abortion rights. Such rights should be a matter for state governments, he said, while refusing to back rightwing calls for a national ban, a stance which has angered some close allies. Trump’s political opponents were swift to point out that he regularly boasts about being the architect of Dobbs v Jackson, the 2022 supreme court ruling in which three US supreme court justices he appointed voted to bring down Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which protected federal abortion rights. Joe Biden and other Democrats repeatedly point to Trump’s role in making the Dobbs ruling possible, thereby triggering draconian state bans including the one in Arizona. Elsewhere in his words with reporters on Wednesday, Trump said authorities in Arizona would “bring it back into reason and that it will be taken care of, I think, very quickly”. Arizona is a swing state, key to the looming presidential and congressional elections. Though the Arizona supreme court is controlled by the right, the state’s governor, Katie Hobbs, and attorney general, Kris Mayes, are Democrats. On Tuesday, Mayes decried “an existential crisis for our residents” and told NBC: “Millions of Arizonans – men and women, Republicans, Democrats, independents – woke up this morning to a decision that drags us back to 1864 … I have said I will not prosecute anyone under this draconian law.” In Georgia, Trump claimed “it’s the will of the people” that abortion be left to the states. But national public opinion remains heavily in favour of abortion rights, a winning campaign issue for Democrats since federal rights were removed. Since Dobbs, Democrats have enjoyed significant election wins while campaigning on abortion rights and ballot measures safeguarding such rights have been approved, even in Republican-run states. More such measures are due to be decided this year. Leading Arizona Republicans including Kari Lake, a Trump-backed election denier now running for US Senate, backed away from the state supreme court decision. On the national stage, Trump must walk a political tightrope, needing to satisfy hardline anti-abortion campaigners, dominant in his Republican base, while appealing to moderates and independents. His personal views on the subject are a matter of constant speculation. In 2016, running for president and under fire for suggesting women who received abortions should be punished, he was asked by the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd if he had ever been involved with anyone who had an abortion. “Such an interesting question,” Trump said. “So what’s your next question?” Eight years on, in Georgia, Trump was asked if doctors should be punished for performing abortions. “I’ll let that be to the states,” Trump said. “You know everything we’re doing now is states and states’ rights and what we wanted to do is get it back to the states because for 53 years [actually 51 since Roe] it’s been a fight and now the states are handling it and some have handled it very well and the others will end up handling it very well.” Biden’s campaign communications director, Michael Tyler, issued a statement in response. He said: “Donald Trump owns the suffering and chaos happening right now, including in Arizona, because he proudly overturned Roe – something he called ‘an incredible thing’ and ‘pretty amazing’ just today. “Trump lies constantly – about everything – but has one track record: banning abortion every chance he gets. The guy who wants to be a dictator on day one will use every tool at his disposal to ban abortion nationwide, with or without Congress, and running away from reporters to his private jet like a coward doesn’t change that reality.” Amid widespread incredulity and alarm over the Arizona supreme court decision, the Boston College historian Heather Cox Richardson pointed out in her Letters from an American newsletter that the law concerned, which “will begin to be enforced in 14 days”, was “written by a single man in 1864”. “In 1864,” Cox Richardson wrote, “Arizona was not a state, women and minorities could not vote, and doctors were still sewing up wounds with horsehair and storing their unwashed medical instruments in velvet-lined cases. And, of course, the United States was in the midst of the civil war. “… The law that Arizona will use to outlaw abortion care seemed designed to keep men in the chaos of the civil war from inflicting damage on others – including pregnant women – rather than to police women’s reproductive care … Written to police the behavior of men, the code tells a larger story about power and control.”","2024-04-10T19:37:48Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/trump-arizona-abortion-ban-"
"abortion","California’s attorney general readies the fight against Trump’s extreme agenda: ‘We’re prepared’","California was considered a leader in fighting the most extreme policies of Donald Trump’s first administration, and after the Republican’s decisive win this week, officials in the Golden state say they are more prepared to resist Trump’s expected agenda for his second term. Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, will be a crucial figure in that effort, tasked with spearheading litigation and defending vulnerable Californians’ rights in the courtroom. It’s a tall order as the president-elect has promised policies that could threaten the state’s immigrant population, LGBTQ+ residents, climate initiatives, gun safety measures, healthcare programs and abortion rights. But Bonta, in an interview with the Guardian on Thursday, said his office was ready on every front. “I know a lot of people are anxious and worried, concerned, fearful, angry, sad,” said the Democrat, who now occupies the seat previously held by Kamala Harris. “I’m not happy with the results, but I’m energized and ready to fight … I’m ready to do my job and lean in hard and punch back and push back and fight back against any attacks from the Trump administration on California’s ongoing progress.” Bonta’s efforts could have a significant impact in the most populous and diverse state in the US, home to the fifth largest economy in the world and considered a leader on progressive policies. In Trump’s first term, Bonta recalled, California successfully fought Trump’s “public charge” rule, which sought to block green cards for immigrants who accessed certain benefits, such as food stamps. The state also sued to prevent Trump from denying funds to sanctuary cities, and helped stop the former president’s effort to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program that protects immigrants who entered the US unauthorized as children. “Trump has a very difficult time resisting the temptation to violate the law,” said Bonta, saying he expected the president-elect to once again use executive action to make changes that require congressional action. “If he wanted to take a blowtorch to the Affordable Care Act and end it on day one by executive order … he can’t do it.” Trump recently said he had “concepts of a plan” to replace the popular Obama-era program that expanded healthcare coverage, and his victory has raised alarms among public health advocates. Bonta said he had been in discussion with attorneys general across the US – sharing briefs, memos and knowledge from their fights during Trump’s first term – and they were primed to coordinate lawsuits as needed: “It’s all hands on deck, use every tool that you have. Litigation will certainly be one of the most potent and powerful ones. “We’ve been preparing for months, in some cases years,” he continued. After Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022, his staff wrote a legal brief to challenge a national abortion ban, a draft he has ready, if necessary. His staff has also monitored comments by Trump’s inner circle and reviewed Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint for his second term drafted by Trump’s allies. “We’ve got a lot in our back pocket ready to drop,” he said. “In some [cases], the whole strategy is thought through – the court we file in, when we file it, based on what action the Trump administration takes. We’ve just gotta dot the Is and cross the Ts and press print. But we are very far along, very advanced in our preparation.” Trump has threatened unprecedented mass deportations, an agenda that was partially thwarted in his first term by California and other blue states that passed sanctuary laws limiting local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. California Democrats will face pressure from immigrant rights’ groups to expand those sanctuary policies, which advocates say are not currently the strongest in the nation. California prisons, for example, continue to coordinate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which helps drive deportations, but Gavin Newsom, the state governor, has previously vetoed efforts to prevent cooperation with Ice. Bonta said officials should be exploring ways to “reinforce and strengthen” the existing sanctuary law, though he didn’t offer specifics. Newsom has called a special legislative session in December for lawmakers to discuss ways to “Trump-proof” state laws, and immigration will probably be a priority. “The federal government can’t conscript or commandeer state or local resources or law enforcement agencies to do their job [of immigration enforcement],” Bonta said, describing the current sanctuary policies. “There could be some additions that could help make that stronger.” He said he would be looking for ways to ensure the sanctuary law is properly followed and implemented across the state. Advocates are also bracing for rightwing pro-Trump sheriffs in conservative counties to potentially violate California’s sanctuary rules. Bonta said he would respond if that happens: “They are law enforcement officers. They need to enforce the law. They can’t pick and choose the laws they want to enforce … if they’re going to politicize it and break the law, then we’ll be there to hold them accountable.” Trump has also promised a major rollback of LGBTQ+ rights and some of his campaign ads have spread significant misinformation about the rights of transgender Americans, particularly around healthcare and sports. He has pledged to revoke funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to youth, punish schools that affirm trans youth and push a law stating the government doesn’t legally recognize trans people. California was the first state in 2022 to establish itself as a sanctuary for trans kids seeking healthcare, and Bonta’s office successfully sued a local school district over its policy that would have required schools to out trans and gender non-conforming students to their parents. “We’ve been fighting on so many fronts against the attacks on our transgender kids, whether fighting for them to be able to play sports … or use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity, or be able to go to a doctor’s office and have gender-affirming care,” he said. “We will continue … The courts are a good place to find relief when you target and single out someone based on their protected class.” Bonta advocated for Harris during the election and was hoping he would not need to stand up to the federal government. “I didn’t want this outcome,” he said. “I was working to have a different outcome, but I couldn’t guarantee [it] … so we needed to be prepared for the possibility of [Trump]. Unfortunately, this outcome is here. Fortunately, though, we’re ready for it, because we prepared.” Read more of the Guardian’s 2024 US election coverage A masculinity researcher on the Democrats’ ‘fatal miscalculation’ Election deniers use Trump victory to sow more doubt over 2020 result What a second Trump presidency means for big US tech firms","2024-11-08T16:17:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-proof-california-ag"
"abortion","We must defend elective abortions, not just the most politically palatable cases","A Kentucky woman known by the pseudonym Mary Poe recently filed a lawsuit against her state, seeking an abortion for what was once a banal reason: because she wanted one. Poe, who was about seven weeks pregnant at the time of the lawsuit’s filing, has since had an abortion out of state. But her attorneys argue that she still has standing to sue to overturn Kentucky’s two abortion bans – a six-week ban and a separate total ban – arguing that the laws violate the state constitution. This much, at least, is typical: lawsuits challenging abortion bans have sprung up across the country since Dobbs, with women and their families seeking to overturn bans, expand exceptions, or get some compensation from the state for the graphic, distressing, disabling or deadly outcomes that the bans have made them suffer. The US supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe in Dobbs cited the surge in activist litigation around abortion – a product of conservative investment in anti-choice legal shops – as part of their reason for doing so. Surely this must be a contentious, controversial issue that the federal bench is ill equipped to resolve, the judges from the conservative legal movement reasoned – because look how many complaints the conservative legal movement has filed against it! This rationale was always disingenuous, but it has also been proved flatly wrong: Dobbs has not got the courts out of the abortion business. Instead, lawsuits over abortion have exploded. The anti-choice camp has pounced, seeking to further restrict abortion by banning pills; targeting reproductive rights advocates, abortion funds and sexual health educators; claiming rights for fetuses or embryos; or by asserting that men who father pregnancies have a right to keep women from terminating them. But the pro-abortion rights side has been busy with litigation, too. Women who have been put at great health risk or made to suffer terrible, painful complications as a result of bans brought a class-action lawsuit in Texas. Bans have been challenged over and over again – on religious liberty grounds, on the grounds of state constitutional provisions securing the right to make individual healthcare decisions, under a federal law that guarantees emergency room treatment for patients needing stabilizing care, and under state constitutional clauses guaranteeing liberty, due process and privacy. The Kentucky lawsuit is part of this latter camp. Mary Poe has cited Kentucky’s constitutional guarantees of individual rights to both privacy and self-determination, which she says have been violated by the bans. “I feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state,” she said in a statement delivered via her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union. “I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the healthcare they need in our community.” This kind of desire for an abortion – the dignified simplicity of it – has been missing from much of the post-Dobbs abortion rights discourse. After the ruling, as trigger bans shot into effect across the country, clinics shuttered their doors, and scared women tried to discern their options, there was no shortage of tragic stories highlighting the brutality, indignity and gendered bigotry of the laws. But as the dust settled and members of the Democratic party, the major reproductive rights advocacy groups and the liberal legal movement surveyed the national scene, a consensus emerged that the face of the mainstream pro-choice movement would be the patient who experienced a medical emergency. Women who had suffered horrific medical complications became lucid, moving and highly sought after tellers of their own stories, explaining how abortion bans has risked their health: Amanda Zurawski, for example, was denied an emergency abortion at 18 weeks, subsequently went into septic shock twice, and one of her fallopian tubes was so scarred that it is now permanently closed, inhibiting her future fertility. Kate Cox was denied an abortion after discovering that her fetus has trisomy 18, a rare genetic condition which is incompatible with life, and which, because of Cox’s own medical history, also endangered her fertility and life. During her presidential run, Kamala Harris ran an ad featuring a woman identified only as Ondrea, who suffered a miscarriage at 16 weeks and was denied the standard care due to her state’s abortion ban. She developed sepsis and almost died. The ad features a shot of Ondrea in a bathroom, staring at her body in a mirror wearing only a sports bra. Her belly bears the scars of the emergency surgery that eventually saved her life – the surgery that she never would have had to have if it weren’t for the ban. It does not diminish these women’s bravery, their suffering, or the wrongness of what was done to them to say that they are only one small fraction of those who need abortions in America. These are married, middle-class women with wanted pregnancies; Zurawski and Cox are both white. Cox has spoken movingly about her hopes to meet her future child, a girl; in the ad that features Ondrea, she and her husband hold a baby blanket. These are women whose suffering at the hands of abortion bans has nothing to do with a refusal or distaste for heterosexual, married, middle-class life. Their suffering can be made visible precisely because they are so acceptable. Not so with Mary Poe. Poe may well be married, middle-class and white; from her statement, in which she talks about the difficulty of finding childcare, we can infer that she, like most abortion patients, is already a mother. But Poe is not suffering a physical emergency; she is not enduring any pain or medical misfortune that she can use to purchase social license. She is not, in other words, a woman whose claim to an abortion is based on a plea for mercy. She is merely a woman who seeks to be in control of her own life, one who believes that things like privacy and self-determination apply to her, too. “I have decided that ending my pregnancy is the best decision for me and my family,” Poe writes in her public statement. “This is a personal decision, a decision I believe should be mine alone, not made by anyone else.” This was not always a radical proposition. But in the post-Dobbs world, it has sadly become one.

"abortion","‘Shame! Shame!’: Arizona Republican leaders block effort to repeal abortion ban","Arizona’s state Republican leadership halted an effort by Democrats on Wednesday to repeal an 1864 law banning almost all abortions, which the state supreme court this week ruled could go into effect. The move came after Republican lawmakers in the state had denounced the court’s decision, including some who previously expressed support for the law. Donald Trump and other high-profile Republicans, such as the Senate candidate Kari Lake, had also declared their opposition to the ruling with Lake urging lawmakers to “come up with an immediate commonsense solution that Arizonans can support”. The Arizona supreme court ruled on Tuesday that the 1864 law can go into effect – though it may not happen for weeks. Under the law, which predates Arizona’s statehood, there are no exceptions for rape or incest and abortions are permitted only if the mother’s life is at risk. Democrats and one Republican lawmaker sought to repeal the law, but GOP leaders, who command the majority, cut it off twice and quickly adjourned for the week. Outraged Democrats erupted in finger-waving chants of “Shame! Shame!” Republican state Rep Teresa Martinez, of Casa Grande, said there was no reason to rush the debate. She accused Democrats of “screaming at us and engaging in extremist and insurrectionist behaviour on the House floor”. The GOP-led senate briefly convened without debate on abortion. Democratic legislators seized on national interest in the state’s abortion ban. “We’ve got the eyes of the world watching Arizona right now,” said Democratic state Rep Stephanie Stahl Hamilton, of Tucson. “We know that the supreme court decision yesterday is extreme. And we know that should the 1864 ban on abortion remain a law in Arizona, people will die.” The state supreme court’s decision is expected to have major repercussions in the state and could significantly impact abortion access across the US south-west. Political strategists have said that the near total ban would draw moderate voters to Democrats and mobilize young voters and voters of color. “This was an earthquake of epic proportions in Arizona politics,” said Barrett Marson, a Phoenix-based Republican strategist. “Anytime Republicans are talking about abortion, they’re losing. Now, I think the only issue is going to be abortion.” Democratic governor Katie Hobbs called inaction on the proposed repeal unconscionable. “Radical legislators protected a Civil War-era total abortion ban that jails doctors, strips women of our bodily autonomy and puts our lives at risk,” she said. Some Republicans in the state had, surprisingly, come out against the court’s decision. “This decision cannot stand,” Matt Gress, a Republican state representative, said. “I categorically reject rolling back the clock to a time when slavery was still legal and we could lock up women and doctors because of an abortion.” Gress had tried to bring forth a bill to repeal the ban but then voted with other Republicans to move to recess. The Republican speaker of the Arizona state house and the president of the state senate, said in a joint statement they would be “listening to our constituents to determine the best course of action for the legislature”. Democrats, who have made Arizona a top priority in 2024, hope to flip both the state house and senate and have seized on Republicans’ decision. “I am disgusted by the actions of my peers, both lying about their stance on this issue so important to Arizonans, and refusing to repeal the 1864 ban,” said Priya Sundareshan, a Democratic senator and Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee co-chair. “This is why we need to flip the legislature, pass the ballot initiative and stop Republicans from taking away this right ever again.” Reuters contributed to this report","2024-04-11T07:43:30Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/10/arizona-republicans-block-repeal-state-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Charges dropped against US woman found unconscious after miscarriage","The charges against a Georgia woman who was found bleeding and unconscious after a miscarriage were dropped on Friday. The woman, 24-year-old Selena Maria Chandler-Scott, was arrested late last month after emergency responders were called in to treat her, according to a police press release. A witness reported that Chandler-Scott had “placed the fetus in a bag and placed that bag in a dumpster outside”, police said. Police then arrested Chandler-Scott and charged her with one count of concealing the death of another person and with one count of throwing away or abandonment of a dead body. The case sparked national outrage, as abortion rights supporters worried about the consequences of treating pregnancies like crime scenes. But on Friday Patrick Warren, the Tift county district attorney, announced that he had dropped the charges against Chandler-Scott. “After thorough examination of the facts and the law, my office has determined that continuing prosecution is not legally sustainable and not in the interest of justice,” Warren said in a statement provided to the Guardian. “This case is heartbreaking and emotionally difficult for everyone involved, but our decision must be grounded in law, not emotion or speculation. A medical examiner determined that the fetus was approximately 19 weeks, according to Warren’s statement. Found to be “non-viable at the time it was naturally miscarried”, the fetus showed no signs of breathing on its own or foul play. The case against Chandler-Scott is believed to be the first of its kind in Georgia, according to Dana Sussman, the senior vice-president of Pregnancy Justice, a reproductive justice group that tracks the criminalization of pregnancy. After the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, Georgia enacted an abortion ban that includes language suggesting that fetuses are people. The anti-abortion movement has long aimed to implement the doctrine of “fetal personhood”, which holds that embryos and fetuses should be treated like people, complete with full legal rights and protections. Warren concluded, however, that the fetus was “not legally classified as having been born alive and lived independently under Georgia law”, according to his statement. “While law enforcement acted in good faith and responded to a very difficult and emotional situation,” he said, “it’s now clear that no criminal law was violated.” Sussman called dropping the charges against Chandler-Scott “the only logical decision here”. “This doesn’t undo the trauma she faced of being arrested after a tragic medical emergency,” Sussman said in a statement. “There is no one-size-fits-all way to handle fetal remains in these situations – in fact, doctors often tell women to simply miscarry at home. No one is taught how to handle fetal remains, and police and prosecutors should not be weighing in on how women in this situation respond.” These kinds of charges are relatively unusual, but not unheard of. Between 1973, when the US supreme court decided Roe, and 2022, there were more than 1,800 cases where people faced criminal consequences connected to pregnancy, according to research by Pregnancy Justice. Of the cases where researchers could ascertain the charges, 2% involved charges of tampering with a corpse or something similar. In 2023, Brittany Watts, an Ohio woman who experienced a miscarriage, was charged with abuse of a corpse. A grand jury ultimately declined to move forward with the case against Watts.","2025-04-04T18:14:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/georgia-miscarriage-charges-dropped"
"abortion","Mike Pence urges Senate Republicans to reject RFK Jr for US health secretary","Mike Pence, the former vice-president, urged Senate Republicans on Friday to reject Donald Trump’s choice of Robert F Kennedy Jr as health secretary – although he cited Kennedy’s support for abortion rights, while other critics are most outraged at his stance against vaccines. Pence’s comments came as public alarm mounted among Democrats and in health circles about Kennedy, while there were bipartisan warnings that another of Trump’s choices, the far-right congressman Matt Gaetz for attorney general, faces “an uphill battle” to win confirmation in the US Senate, despite Republicans winning the majority in the upper congressional chamber. Pence cited his conservative views on abortion for his opposition to Kennedy’s elevation to secretary of health and human services (HHS). “The Trump-Pence administration was unapologetically pro-life for our four years in office. There are hundreds of decisions made at HHS every day that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it, and HHS under our administration always stood for life,” Pence said in a statement released by his conservative non-profit, Advancing American Freedom. “I believe the nomination of RFK Jr to serve as Secretary of HHS is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration and should be deeply concerning to millions of Pro-Life Americans who have supported the Republican Party and our nominees for decades.” Prominent medical professionals have joined leading Democrats in speaking out against Kennedy, who has embraced a multitude of debunked health-related conspiracy theories, and whose proposed elevation to the government’s top health job represents “a clear and present danger to the nation’s health” and “a catastrophe”, according to some critics. “I think this is an extraordinarily bad choice. He does not plan to lean on evidence and rigorous analysis to make decisions but instead to use his own ideas,” Dr Ashish Jha, Covid-19 coordinator for the Biden White House and dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, told CNN. Dr Richard Besser, former acting director of the powerful US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the network that Kennedy’s views criticizing childhood vaccines, including the false claim that they cause autism, were “dangerous”. “Frankly, I find it chilling. He has done so much to undermine the confidence that people have in that incredible intervention,” he said. Trump has been assembling a cabinet for his second term in office, making announcements this week from his residence in Florida, and on Thursday named Kennedy to lead HHS and its associated agencies. He praised the politician, a former independent presidential candidate and outcast from the Democratic Kennedy political dynasty, at a black-tie gala at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday night. “If you like health and if you like people that live a long time, it’s the most important position,” he said. Directly addressing Kennedy, who was in the ballroom of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and private resort club, he added: “We want you to come up with things and ideas, and what you’ve been talking about for a long time.” Democrats were quick to express outrage. The California representative Robert Garcia called it “fucking insane” and described Kennedy as “a tin foil hat conspiracy theorist”. The Massachusetts representative Jake Auchincloss promised to “fight back in Washington to protect the integrity” of federal public health agencies if Kennedy is confirmed by the Senate. “RFK Jr is a conspiracist &amp; quack who threatens the health of Americans. He’s not simply angling for more sunshine &amp; exercise (no one disagrees with that). He seeks to overturn evidence-driven, peer-reviewed research on medicines &amp; more,” Auchincloss posted to X. Shares in several of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies and vaccine manufacturers, including Moderna, AstraZeneca and GSK, plummeted on Friday in reaction to the news. Kennedy has previously said “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” but told NBC in a post-election interview that he “won’t take away anybody’s vaccines”. Trump on Thursday nominated a vocal ally of his to be interior secretary – Doug Burgum, the Republican North Dakota governor. The role would put him in charge of national parks and public lands, and he has strong links to the fossil fuel industry, where many companies have strong appetites for government permits to drill and mine on federal land. Republicans will have a majority of at least 53-47 seats in the chamber during the next Congress, but even so, two other of Trump’s picks are already receiving bipartisan pushback: Gaetz and the former Democratic congresswoman turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard, named for director of national intelligence. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton once described her as a “favorite of the Russians”. Gaetz resigned as a US representative for Florida on Wednesday, in effect suspending the planned release on Friday of a report by the House of Representatives ethics committee into allegations of sexual misconduct, including that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl, which he has denied. His nomination as the nation’s leading law enforcement officer was seen by some as a direct challenge by Trump to the incoming Republican Senate majority to defy his authority. “For me the message to the administration is simply that Matt Gaetz has a very long, steep hill to get across the finish line and it will require the spending of a lot of capital,” North Dakota’s Republican senator Kevin Cramer told the Washington Post. “That ethics report is clearly going to become a part of the record.” On Friday, Joni Ernst, Republican senator for Iowa, also said the report was expected to feature prominently in a confirmation hearing. “We’ll talk about it for certain, but I know he’s going to have an uphill battle [for confirmation],” she told NBC News. Other Republicans demanded the release of the report, including Washington congressman Dan Newhouse and Texas senator John Cornyn. Meanwhile former defense secretary and Republican US senator Chuck Hagel published an opinion piece in the New York Times challenging Trump’s controversial nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as a potential “danger” to political independence, good ethics and progress towards equality in the US military. He also questioned the potential for Trump to sidestep Senate confirmations. Trump has signaled he could resort to rare recess appointments, the archaic process allowing a president to install his nominees while Congress is not in session.","2024-11-15T18:05:15Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/15/mike-pence-reject-rfk-jr-trump"
"abortion","Donald Trump says each US state should determine different abortion laws","Donald Trump on Monday announced his belief that individual US states should decide the legality of abortion, declining to endorse a national ban on the procedure. The former president’s stated position dashed hopes of anti-abortion groups, who want a federal ban, and drew the ire of Democrats, who blame Trump for outright bans and severe restrictions already in place across the south and midwest. Trump’s announcement had been highly anticipated by Democrats, who believe the fight over abortion rights helps them at the polls, and Republicans, who failed to push Trump to endorse a national abortion ban during their party’s primary. In a four-minute video post on Truth Social, Trump said it was “up to the states to do the right thing” while also touting his work to confirm the conservative supreme court justices who ultimately overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. “States will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both,” Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in the videotaped address. “Whatever they decide must be the law of the land, or in this case the law of the state.” “Many states will be different, many will have a different number of weeks, some will be more conservative than others,” he continued. “At the end of the day this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart, or in many cases your religion or faith.” “Do what’s right for your family, and do what’s right for yourself,” he added. Joe Biden seized on Trump’s announcement, saying Trump had “made it clear once again today that he is – more than anyone in America – the person responsible for ending Roe v Wade”. “Trump is scrambling. He’s worried that since he’s the one responsible for overturning Roe the voters will hold him accountable in 2024. Well, I have news for Donald. They will,” the president said in a statement. In a press call, a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign said abortion bans and severe restrictions are “the reality facing women in this country because Donald Trump overturned Roe v Wade”, and that Donald Trump “owns the state of abortion rights in our country”. The campaign promised to restore federal protections for abortion up to the point of viability, or when a fetus can live outside the womb, if Biden is re-elected. Viability is generally considered at 24 weeks gestation. A full term pregnancy is 39 weeks. “Donald Trump’s comments today are an endorsement of the nightmare we’re seeing play out in the 21 states with abortion bans,” said Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion in Texas in spite of severe abnormalities in the fetus she was carrying. At a 13-week ultrasound, Kash found out her fetus had skeletal dysplasia, a condition that meant her child’s bones would be crushed in utero. If she gave birth, she was told, the baby would likely suffocate soon afterward. “It is unthinkable to me that anyone could cheer on the cruel abortion bans that threaten women’s lives,” said Kash, who was forced to seek an abortion out of state. She is one of several women suing Texas. For more than a year Trump has declined to say when in a pregnancy he would try to draw the line, even as Republican-led states have ushered in a wave of new restrictions and anti-abortion groups pressured him and other Republican presidential candidates to endorse a federal ban on the procedure. In his statement, Trump did not say whether he would sign into law a national abortion ban if he were president and Congress passed a federal limit. Neither did he say how he, as a resident of Florida, would vote on a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into that state’s constitution. Senior Republican senator Lindsey Graham declared his opposition to Trump’s position Monday, saying that leaving the issue entirely to the states “runs contrary to an American consensus that would limit late-term abortions”. “I will continue to advocate that there should be a national minimum standard limiting abortion at 15 weeks because the child is capable of feeling pain, with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,” Graham said. In a statement on Monday, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of SBA Pro-Life America, one of the most powerful anti-abortion groups in the country, said she was “deeply disappointed” in Trump’s position. “Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry,” she said, adding that allowing states to decide the issue “cedes the national debate to the Democrats”. Dannenfelser had previously warned that her group would not support any candidate who refused to support a national ban. On Monday, she said her group would “work tirelessly” to defeat Joe Biden in November. Democrats, who have made abortion a central issue of the election, said Trump supported laws in the more than two dozens states that have imposed outright bans or restrictions on the procedure since Roe v Wade was overturned. “Donald Trump is endorsing every single abortion ban in the states, including abortion bans with no exceptions,” Ammar Moussa, director of rapid response for the Biden campaign, wrote on X. “And he’s bragging about his role in creating this hellscape.” In the video, Trump thanked the six conservative supreme court justices – three of whom he appointed as president – “for having the courage to allow this long-term, hard fought battle to finally end” by striking down Roe v Wade nearly 50 years after it was decided. He also sought to portray Democrats as “radical” for opposing abortion access restrictions. But he simultaneously blamed Republicans for being too extreme on the issue. Since the 2022 ruling, Democrats and pro-choice voters have won big at the ballot box, including in conservative states where abortion bans have proved unpopular. Meanwhile public polling has consistently found that a majority of Americans generally favor access to abortion. In articulating his position, Trump said he was “strongly in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother”. “You must follow your heart on this issue but remember you must also win elections to restore our culture and, in fact, to save our country,” he said. Trump emphasized his support for in vitro fertilization (IVF), after a February court ruling in Alabama declared frozen embryos people in a decision that threatened to shut down fertility treatments in the state. The decision sparked widespread backlash and Republicans raced to distance themselves from it, even though some in Congress have supported legislation that would recognize embryos as humans entitled to legal protections. Trump praised the Republican-dominated Alabama state legislature for passing a law protecting IVF after the outcry. Reproductive medicine specialists said the law did not go far enough. Trump has long argued that the supreme court’s decision overturning Roe gave those who oppose abortion rights “tremendous power to negotiate”. He said he wanted to use that leverage to strike a deal that he hoped would “make both sides happy” and bring the country “together” – even though the issue is one of the most contentious in American politics, with opponents viewing abortion as a form of murder and proponents seeing it as a fundamental right. Trump suggested last month in a radio interview that he was leaning toward supporting a national abortion ban at about 15 weeks of pregnancy – which is early in the second trimester. “The number of weeks now, people are agreeing on 15. And I’m thinking in terms of that,” he said on WABC radio. “And it’ll come out to something that’s very reasonable. But people are really, even hard-liners are agreeing, seems to be, 15 weeks seems to be a number that people are agreeing at.” At the same time, Trump seemed reluctant to embrace a federal ban. “Everybody agrees – you’ve heard this for years, all the legal scholars on both sides agree: it’s a state issue. It shouldn’t be a federal issue, it’s a state issue,” he said. On the campaign trail, Trump has been ambivalent on abortion. He routinely takes credit for appointing the supreme court justices who set the stage for the elimination of Roe v Wade, which he has called a “moral and unconstitutional atrocity”. He has also called himself the “most pro-life president in American history”. But he has repeatedly dismissed as too extreme fellow Republicans who oppose exceptions to abortion in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the pregnant person is at risk. And he has said being too hard-line on the issue cost Republicans at the polls in the 2022 midterms and could do so again when he challenges Biden in November’s presidential election.

"abortion","‘Trump is inconsistent with Christian principles’: why the Democratic party is seeing a rise of white clergy candidates","He grew up on a farm in Indiana, the son of a factory worker and eldest of five children. He studied at Liberty, a Christian university founded by the conservative pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell, and recalls wearing a T-shirt expressing opposition to the Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Two decades later, Justin Douglas is running for the US Congress – as a Democrat. He is among about white 30 Christian clergy – pastors, seminary students and other faith leaders – known to be potential Democratic candidates in next year’s midterm elections, including a dozen who are already in the race. While stressing the separation of church and state, many say that on a personal level their faith is calling them into the political arena. The trend marks a break from a traditional racial divide. Whereas Black pastors who run for office are typically Democrats, their white counterparts are usually Republicans, reflecting the strength of the religious right and the party’s dominance among evangelical voters. Douglas, 41, based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is among a new generation of the Christian left aiming to change that narrative by ensuring that the Democratic brand is not associated with only college-educated urbanites, but can also connect with white working-class churchgoers. “We’ve seen Democrats time and time again sell out working-class people and we’ve seen Democrats time and time again look like liberal elitists who are looking down on people who think going to church on Sunday is a core part of their life,” said Douglas, who has been in ministry for more than 20 years. “Some people might feel judged for that. “But I also think the stereotypes of Republicans being pro-faith are bullshit too. We’re seeing a current administration bastardise faith almost every day. They used the Lord’s Prayer in a propaganda video for what they’re now calling the Department of War. That should have had every single evangelical’s bells and whistles and alarms going off in their head: this is sacrilegious. “But unfortunately, sometimes, when you’re in it, you can’t see it and it takes somebody who has an ability to communicate to that audience, to help show that you’re being manipulated.” For decades, many white Christians were not partisan and often voted Democratic, especially in the south. But by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Democratic party’s identity was shifting toward civil rights, feminism and secular liberalism. Many white conservative Christians felt increasingly alienated from the party they had long inhabited. The racial divide can in part be traced to the mid-1970s when the Internal Revenue Service began removing tax-exempt status from private schools that discriminated by race. Conservative Christian leaders such as Jerry Falwell saw this as federal overreach and seized on abortion as an issue that could be framed in religious and political terms. Falwell’s organisation the Moral Majority used abortion as a broader symbol of moral decline alongside feminism, sex education and gay rights. His followers then felt betrayed when Jimmy Carter, the first evangelical Christian to occupy the White House, failed to pursue their priorities. They defected to Republican Ronald Reagan, and, by the end of the 1980s, white evangelicals had become one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs, even as Black churchgoers remained loyal to Democrats. That has persisted over the past decade under Donald Trump, seen by critics as vulgar and unchristian but by supporters as a blunt instrument to defend a church under siege by a godless liberal culture. Whereas Carter earned 60% of the white evangelical vote in 1976, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton gained only a 16% share in 2016. It was a troubling realignment that caught the eye of Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of the progressive Christian group Vote Common Good. He said: “That’s not natural. That’s not just a policy change. There was something more significant going on. It’s been a two-sided effort. Republicans have oriented themselves primarily around religious voter identity and Democrats have set aside religious voter identity, including the fact that in 1992 Democrats removed from the voter access file the category of religious identity.” Pagitt said Charlie Kirk’s organisation Turning Point USA was vital in turning out young Christian voters for Trump last year: “The difference couldn’t be more stark, which is why white clergy running for office is such a big deal when they’re running as Democrats in Iowa, in Arkansas, in Pennsylvania, in California.” Trump’s first election was the trigger for a new wave of white clergy to overcome fears of being seen as partisan and run for elected office. Pagitt added: “After 2016 and 2018, a whole lot of people started thinking: ‘Hey, maybe running for office is something we should actually do.’ “Few people are surprised when Raphael Warnock says: ‘I’m a working pastor at Ebenezer Baptist church.’ He comes from the Martin Luther King tradition, from that pulpit, and it made sense: people are like: ‘Yeah, of course a Black clergyman’s going to run as a Democrat.’ But when a white woman pastor in Iowa says, ‘I’m going to run as a Democrat,’ it’s a real statement. It’s taken some of these people a little while to get comfortable with the fact that they are going to be partisan.” Vote Common Good was founded in response to a schism created by the election of Trump, which left many religious people feeling “politically homeless”. The group operates as a “dating service”, connecting these voters with Democrats and non-Maga Republicans. The group will spend time in 50 congressional districts this year helping candidates meet faith voters and leaders in their districts. *** Douglas is a county commissioner looking to unseat Republican Scott Perry in Pennsylvania’s 10th district. But he was previously the lead pastor of a growing church that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to participate fully in its community; over the course of a year, this developed into a huge bone of contention and in 2019 Douglas eventually lost his licence. He had to find a new house and go from one job to three jobs including driving an Uber and CrossFit coaching. He started a new church that is still operating today. Douglas recalls: “I paid the price for standing with the LGBTQ+ people. I would do it again. It taught me that doing what’s right is often costly but always necessary, and everyone deserves to be safe, respected and fully included. That’s not a religious belief. It’s a human belief that I have.” James Talarico, a Texas state representative and a 36-year-old part-time seminary student who has amassed a sizable social media following – has become an unlikely standard-bearer in the Democrats’ 2026 Senate primary. In a series of social media posts, he deploys scripture to champion the poor and vulnerable while castigating Republicans for what he casts as their drift towards Christian nationalism and corporate interests. He asked in one: “Instead of posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom, why don’t they post, ‘Money is the root of all evil’ in every boardroom?” In Iowa, state senator Sarah Trone Garriott, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, is seeking her party’s nod to challenge the Republican incumbent Zach Nunn in what is already billed as one of the nation’s marquee congressional races. In Arkansas, Robb Ryerse, a Christian pastor and former Republican, is mounting a challenge to Representative Steve Womack, adopting the slogan “Faith, Family &amp; Freedom” – rhetoric more commonly found in Republican campaign literature. Ryerse, 50, from Springdale, Arkansas, said: “I joke sometimes that the two people who have changed my life more than any others are Jesus and Donald Trump, for very different reasons. Donald Trump is absolutely inconsistent with Christian principles of love and compassion, justice, looking out for the poor, meeting the needs of the marginalised. “But Donald Trump has also used and been used by so many evangelical leaders who want political power. He has used them to validate him to their followers and they have used him to further their agenda, which has been a Christian nationalist culture war on the United States, which I think is bad for both the church and for the country.” White clergy are deciding to run for office, Ryerse believes, in part as a response to the rise of Christian nationalism and the reality that, according to a Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey, Trump won 85% of the white evangelical vote in last year’s presidential election. Ryerse said: “We realise, hey, our churches and the people in our churches have been duped by this guy and so rather than hope someone else will clean up the problem, what we’ve seen is a lot of pastors respond with, you know what, I’m going to jump in and I’m going to be a part of the solution. “On a more positive note, there’s also that notion we need to do something for the common good. There’s so much alignment between what I believe personally is good for my neighbour, what it means to love my neighbour, and how that aligns with what public policy ought to be.”","2025-11-15T17:00:07Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/christian-democrat-candidates-trump-republicans"
"abortion","‘Raising a family is not easy here’: In-N-Out CEO says she is leaving California","“Follow the money” is an age-old adage for reporters and businesses alike. The CEO of the internationally renowned burger joint In-N-Out, however, is taking a different approach – moving her family from California, where the chain boasts 276 locations, to Tennessee, where it has zero. Billionaire heiress and CEO Lynsi Snyder, granddaughter of In-N-Out’s founders, publicly announced the relocation during a family-and-faith-studded conversation on Allie Beth Stuckey’s podcast Relatable. Interview sponsors included an online academy that promises to keep children safe from socialist indoctrination, as well as an anti-abortion diaper company. Snyder, with a Forbes-estimated net worth of $7.3bn fueled by the California burger chain, said that she sees greener pastures in the Volunteer state, where she plans to beef up the Franklin, Tennessee, office. The company’s two major California offices, in Irvine and Baldwin Park, will be merged under one roof, with the Irvine office closing by 2030. “There’s a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here, doing business is not easy here,” Snyder said. Snyder also detailed her rise in the company, her journey with Christianity and her past marriages. Faith is prominent not just in Snyder’s personal life, but at In-N-Out as well, with Bible verses printed on soda cups and fry bags. Well known for its palm trees and simple menu, the company has exploded past its California roots, with locations in eight states. It currently has 35 locations planned to open in Tennessee. Snyder, however, said that the company has no current intentions for a major east coast expansion. “Florida has begged us and we’re still saying ‘no’, the east coast states we’re still saying ‘no’,” Snyder said.","2025-07-21T22:43:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/21/in-n-out-ceo-california-tennessee"
"abortion","Her abortion experience was ‘bizarre and painful’. Now she’s suing Tennessee","In January 2023, whenever Kathryn Archer took her young daughter out to the local playground in Nashville, Tennessee, strangers often noticed her visibly pregnant stomach and wanted to make small talk. “When are you due?” they would ask Archer. “Do you know if you’re having a boy or a girl?” “Oh, I bet your daughter’s so excited to be a big sister.” Archer did not know how to tell them the truth: in early January, Archer’s fetus had been diagnosed with several serious anomalies that made a miscarriage likely. If Archer did give birth, her baby could only be treated with surgeries and lifelong help – pain that Archer was unwilling to put a newborn through. Without those surgeries, which the infant might not survive, Archer’s baby would die shortly after birth. But due to Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban, Archer could not terminate her pregnancy in her home state and, instead, had to wait more than three weeks for an appointment at an out-of-state abortion clinic. “I don’t want to confide in a stranger that I’m having to get an abortion because my baby can’t survive outside of my womb and I can’t get the care that I need as soon as I need it,” Archer recalled thinking. “Those three weeks were really bizarre, challenging, painful – beyond what it needed to be.” *** In the nearly two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, 16 states have implemented near-total abortion bans. In theory, these bans have exceptions that permit people to get medically necessary abortions – but in practice, doctors and patients say, these exceptions are worded so vaguely that they are unworkable, prompting doctors to delay care out of a fear of running afoul of the law. Dozens of women from states like Texas, Idaho and Oklahoma have come forward to say that they were denied abortions they should have been legally entitled to. Archer is now one of seven women in Tennessee who, along with two doctors, have sued the state, asking a court to clarify the scope of the state’s exception for medically necessary abortions. Currently, Tennessee doctors can use their “reasonable medical judgment” to perform abortions in severe emergencies, but abortion-rights supporters say that the standard is vague and subject to interpretation, leaving well-meaning doctors vulnerable to prosecution. Lawyers from the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the women, instead hope to establish that doctors can use their “good faith medical judgement” to perform an abortion when continuing a pregnancy would be unsafe. They also want to allow abortions if a fetus is unlikely to survive a pregnancy and sustain life after birth – as in Archer’s case. On Thursday, almost all of the women in the lawsuit will gather at a courthouse in Nashville for a hearing in the case. “I felt like if I can share our story and join this lawsuit, and even just change one person’s experience, that would be worth it to me,” Archer said. *** Archer and her husband decided to start trying for a second child right around the time Roe fell. A longtime supporter of abortion rights, Archer was aware of the risks that Tennessee’s abortion ban posed to her pregnancy. “‘What if I have a miscarriage? What if something were to happen in the pregnancy?’” she recalled thinking. “But I was pretty much only thinking about the first trimester.” Archer’s pregnancy appeared normal throughout her first trimester of pregnancy and into her second. In early January 2023, at her 20-week anatomy scan, Archer learned that she would be having a girl. Then the doctor told her: “There are diagnosable abnormalities from head to toe in this baby.” A follow-up visit with a specialist confirmed that the fetus, who Archer and her husband named Cecilia, had a litany of health issues, including brain damage, a bladder located outside the body and severe spina bifida that left the spinal cord and nerves exposed. These anomalies, the specialist told Archer, made it unlikely that Cecilia would make it to birth, according to Archer’s lawsuit. Continuing the pregnancy, rather than ending it, would also pose more risks to Archer’s own health. “After that scan, both my husband and I felt really strongly that the best thing for us to do and for our family would be to terminate the pregnancy,” Archer said. “Our doctors were incredibly supportive. They cared for us in so many ways, but their response was, essentially: ‘Our hands are tied now. We can’t help you any more.’” Archer and her husband immediately started trying to find an appointment at an abortion clinic in another state. Since so many abortion clinics had shuttered in the wake of Roe’s downfall, multiple clinics were booked up for weeks, pushing Archer deeper into a pregnancy that could threaten her own health and increase the risk she would be forced to give birth to a stillborn baby. US abortion clinics performed more than 1m abortions in 2023, a record high. But that number clouds a more complex reality: abortion bans have shuttered numerous abortion clinics in the south and midwest, leaving the remaining clinics on the coasts deluged by a flood of patients from states with abortion bans. Abortion clinics in Kansas, where Archer initially tried to book an appointment, now treat roughly double the number of monthly patients that they saw before Roe fell, one recent analysis found. Only a handful of US clinics provide abortions past about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions also take longer and become more expensive later on in pregnancy. Ultimately, Archer was able to secure an appointment at a Washington DC, abortion clinic, about three and a half weeks after her 20-week anatomy scan. Due to the wait, “it went from a one-day procedure to a two-day procedure,” Archer said. “They give her a shot to essentially stop her heart. And then I had to come back 24 hours later, so there was this period of time where she was no longer alive, but she was still in my body … Had I been able to get the procedure sooner, I wouldn’t have had the longer, slightly more complex procedure.” An abortion fund and a church helped Archer and her husband defray some of the costs, but they still had to pay more than $10,000 out of pocket. “We had really good care because we have resources,” Archer continued. “Had we not had those resources and that privilege, I don’t know what we would have done.” One of the other women involved in the Tennessee lawsuit also learned that her pregnancy was unlikely to result in a healthy baby, but was unable to get an abortion. Against her will, the woman continued her pregnancy and delivered a stillborn son 31 weeks into her pregnancy. *** Archer is now pregnant again and set to give birth in May – almost exactly one year after Cecilia’s due date. Ahead of the abortion, Archer and her husband promised to scatter Cecilia’s ashes near water. “I just felt like, on a spiritual level, that I was really connected to her when I was near the element of water,” Archer said. They also pledged to take a hike every year in her honor. “We did a lot of ritual around death and saying goodbye,” Archer said. “It felt like – at every stage, for her and for our family – we’re doing the right thing.” • This article was amended on 4 April 2024 to correct a quotation from Kathryn Archer in which she said a one-day procedure turned into two-day procedure, not into a three-day procedure as originally quoted.","2024-04-04T11:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/04/tennessee-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Robyn: Dopamine review – complex emotions, instant euphoria: no wonder pop’s A-list love her","At the end of last year, during her triumphant gig at the O2, Charli xcx brought Robyn out onstage. In a sense, it was just the latest in a series of guest appearances on the Brat tour: a string of collaborators from the album and its ensuing remixes – Lorde, Billie Eilish, Troye Sivan and Addison Rae among them – had turned up at different shows to perform their parts live. But as well as contributing her verse to their remix of 360, Robyn also took centre stage, performing her peerless 2010 single Dancing on My Own. Released when at least some of Charli xcx’s audience were still in nappies, it didn’t sound remotely like a throwback even in the context of a gig based around one of 2024’s most acclaimed and agenda-setting pop albums: the star of the show’s willingness to cede the spotlight to her felt like evidence of Robyn’s influence over contemporary pop. You can see why the Swedish singer-songwriter carries so much clout among pop stars of the mid-2020s. When she opened an album with a track called Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do, she wasn’t joking: after launching as a 90s teen-pop star produced by Max Martin, she rejected the usual strictures placed on female pop – walking away from not one but two major label deals due to lack of artistic control – and seemed intent on following a more idiosyncratic, complex, messy path. She never saw being in the centre of mainstream pop as antithetical to making music with depth, or that touched on contentious issues. Despite the worldwide success of her debut, Robyn Is Here, her second album, My Truth, went unreleased outside Sweden because her US-based label baulked at Giving You Back, a song about an abortion she’d had in 1998: when asked to remove the song, Robyn refused. Gaining her independence, she went on to collaborate with both Sweden’s blue-chip pop factories and a succession of experimental electronic artists, the Knife and Röyksopp among them, at a time when blurring the boundary between mainstream pop and the musical left field was far from commonplace. A 46-year-old who released her first single in 1995, a year before the Spice Girls were launched, she seems to have more in common with pop artists half her age than with most of her peers. So you would say that her first solo release in seven years was arriving at an opportune moment, were it not for the fact that Robyn doesn’t seem to do anything in a particularly opportune way. Either way, Dopamine is a striking return. Its sound is jubilant and dancefloor-focused: a four-to-the-floor house kick drum accentuated by a relentless rhythmic vocal sample, chattering Giorgio Moroder-esque synths, Daft Punk-like robotic voices, euphoria-inducing bursts of arpeggiated electronics, a killer earworm chorus. It’s noticeably a more neon-hued than her reflective last album, 2018’s Honey, but just beneath its bright exterior lurks something more complex. It’s a song ostensibly about the first rush of falling in love, but tempers its giddy enthusiasm with a weird hint of desperation (“I just need to know that I’m not alone”) a further dash of fatalism (“it’s going to be whatever and that’s cool”). There’s also a curious tension between trying to explain attraction away as something scientific – an excess of the titular chemical – and something more spiritual and intangible: “Something here’s opening deep inside of me / And I can finally feel it.” The lyric never quite declares its hand: you could read it as emotion triumphing over rationality, or you could equally read it as tempering a standard pop cliche with a stark realism. It’s complicated and messy: it’s also an unequivocal pop banger. Which of course, makes it very of the moment, but also makes it very Robyn.","2025-11-13T15:44:23Z","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/13/robyn-dopamine-single-review"
"abortion","US confidence in judicial system dropped to record low this year, data shows","Americans’ confidence in the US judicial system and courts dropped to a record low this year, according to newly released data. A new Gallup poll, published on Tuesday, reveals that only 35% of Americans surveyed in 2024 expressed confidence in their country’s judicial system and courts – representing a decline of 24 percentage points since 2020, marking one of the largest national level drops for the courts measured globally by Gallup since 2006. Few countries and territories have experienced larger drops in confidence – speaking in terms of percentage points – in their judiciary systems over a similar four-year period than the US, the poll states. Among the few countries listed by Gallup are Myanmar, which faced a 46-point decline following its return to military rule in 2021; Venezuela, which saw a 35-point drop between 2012 and 2016 amid economic and political turmoil; and Syria, which experienced a 28-point decline from 2009 to 2013 during the early stages of its civil war. Between 2006 and 2020, Americans’ perceptions of their country’s courts generally aligned with the median confidence level of the 38 member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which was 55%. At the time of Tuesday’s poll release, there was a 20-point gap in confidence between the US and the median of OECD nations, marking the largest gap since Gallup began tracking those trends, the survey states. During Joe Biden’s presidency, the percentage of individuals disapproving of the country’s leadership lost confidence in the judicial system and courts, dropping from 46% in 2021 to just 29% in 2024. Among those approving of the country’s leadership, judicial confidence remained steady at 62% from 2021 to 2023 – but experienced a sharp decline to 44% this year. “This year marks the first time on record that judicial confidence among those approving of US leadership has ever dipped below 60%,” the poll states. It adds: “And the first time that confidence in the courts has been below 50% among both those who approve and those who disapprove of US leadership, a double whammy pushing the national figure to its lowest in two decades.” The Gallup survey was conducted through telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 US adults from 28 June to 1 August of this year. The decline in confidence under Biden indicates that “something profound occurred to atypically shake his opponents’ confidence in the courts”, the survey states, “with the various legal cases against Trump likely factors”. The 18-point drop in confidence in the judicial system between 2023 and 2024 among those who approve of the country’s leadership may also be linked to Trump’s legal cases, the survey states, “reflecting dissatisfaction with several circuit court and supreme court decisions that went in Trump’s favor”. Trump in May was convicted in New York state court of criminally falsifying business records to cover up hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. He also grappled with criminal charges stemming from his and his supporters’ efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election to Biden, though many believe it is unlikely he will face substantial consequence having won the presidency back in November’s election. Previous Gallup surveys have found that Democrats’ trust in the judicial branch, led by the US supreme court, fell 25 points between 2021 and 2022, following the decision in the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, which overturned the federal right to abortion. In 2023, Democrats’ trust in the court increased slightly to 34% – but it fell again to 24% in 2024, when the supreme court issued a ruling with respect to presidential immunity that was seen as substantially advantageous to Trump. In contrast, Republicans’ trust in the supreme court increased from 61% in 2021 to 71% in 2024.","2024-12-17T14:39:17Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/17/judicial-system-courts-confidence-data"
"abortion","Jena Friedman: Motherf*cker review – political zingers and all-too-raw grief","Standup shows about losing a parent – “dead dad shows”, they get called – have become a genre unto themselves in recent times, and nowadays tend to arrive couched in self-awareness and alertness to cliche. No such irony attends Jena Friedman’s show about (among other things) the death of her mother, which – three years on from that event – is palpably raw and vulnerable. The parallels Friedman draws between loss of a parent and the decline of American democracy are lucid. But elsewhere her material on bereavement feels insufficiently processed and too painful, frankly, dissipating the energy of the 42-year-old’s big-hitting opening half. The jaundiced tone of Motherf*cker is established from the off, as Friedman enters the stage flag-waving in a Maga cap to the strains – and it is a strain – of patriotic country music. “I look like a Republican’s wife,” she says, before launching one satirical hand-grenade after another, about abortion in the US, how the Democrats should have run Kamala Harris’s campaign, and how her unborn baby resembles Jeffrey Epstein. The in-your-face material is greeted variously with startled laughter, sometimes dazed silence (“you can’t rape a foetus”), and nonplussedness – see one routine sharing the home addresses of Republican lawmakers, which might be more worthwhile for an American audience. All this is just buildup to the tale of Friedman’s overlapping pregnancy and bereavement. She’s anxious about becoming a parent, turning to her mother for support – only for mum to be given a cancer diagnosis and weeks to live. There’s some meconium-black comedy on how these processes mirror one another (on her son’s difficult birth: “I didn’t want to leave my mum either”) and a could-be-fun closer about her mum intervening (or is she?) from beyond the grave. But their humour is undermined by Friedman’s emphasis on how damaged she was, and still is, by her loss. There’s some awkward crowdwork, too, which includes repeated apologies for the “gross” venue and her miming, apropos of not much, the mass-shooting of her audience.

"abortion","Woman disposed of baby’s body in bin after alleged illegal abortion, court told","A “vulnerable” teenager used pills to abort her baby after being told she could not have a lawful termination, before disposing of the body in a bin, a jury has been told. Sophie Harvey and her boyfriend Elliot Benham, both 19 at time of the alleged offences, were “shellshocked” when they were told she had gone past 24 weeks of pregnancy and could not have an abortion, Gloucester crown court was told. They felt they could not tell their parents and rather than begin to plan to have a baby, allegedly researched on the internet how to obtain an “MTP kit” containing pills that can lead to an abortion. Harvey cried as the prosecution detailed her account to police of losing the baby in the bathroom of her family home in Gloucestershire while relatives were away at a dancing competition. Anna Vigars KC, prosecuting, told the jury the case was sensitive. Describing Harvey and Benham as vulnerable because of their age, she said they had found themselves in a “very difficult” situation facing “very real challenges”. Vigars said that in the late summer of 2018, the pair, who lived with their parents, were boyfriend and girlfriend. On 13 August, they went to see Harvey’s GP because she thought she was pregnant and did not want to keep the baby. She thought she was 16 weeks pregnant and the GP referred her to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) for advice about a termination. The prosecutor said the pair left the GP practice believing their problem would soon be over but on 31 August a scan at a Bpas clinic revealed the baby was 28 weeks and five days, too old for her to have legal abortion. A clinical care coordinator at the clinic said the couple seemed “shellshocked”. The coordinator later told police that Harvey seemed “scared, stunned, catatonic almost” and might have been crying. “I remember being struck by how lost Miss Harvey looked,” she said. Harvey said it was not an option to tell her parents. Addressing the jury, Vigars said: “Whatever your views of abortion and the right of a woman to choose, or whether you believe abortion is wrong because of the ending of a life, what is very clear is this: by the beginning of September 2018, Sophie Harvey and Elliot Benham were in a difficult position and one that was not going to go away unless they did something about it.” Vigars said Harvey’s GP surgery tried over the next weeks and months to contact the teenager to check that she was well and preparing for the baby. But she did not reply to phone messages or letters, it was claimed. Instead, the couple allegedly began to research how they could “get rid” of the baby. “Both of them wanted the problem to disappear,” Vigars told the jury. They looked into whether they could obtain drugs or herbs to terminate the pregnancy. They searched for information about abortion MTP kits. The barrister said it was difficult not to feel sympathy for them. Vigars said Benham, who is from Wiltshire, placed an order for a kit, paying about £310, which he picked up from a mail collection point in Swindon on 22 September. In late November, by which time the baby should have been born, medical staff asked the police to do a welfare check on Harvey. When officers spoke to Harvey she said she had lost the baby. She told them: “I didn’t feel anything for a week or so.” She then felt pain and went to the bathroom, where she said she lost the baby. She told police the baby was small, about 15cm, and unresponsive. She said the body was wrapped in a towel and put in a bin. As the officer’s statement was read out in court, Harvey began to cry and was comforted by Benham. Police later found a kit minus one tablet. Harvey said she had not taken the pill but had disposed of it and insisted the baby had been stillborn. Harvey denies procuring poison with intent to procure a miscarriage and denies administering poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.

"abortion","Number of US abortions fell by only 2% after wave of state bans, CDC report reveals","Despite the wave of state abortion bans that took effect after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022, the number of abortions performed in the US fell by only 2% that year, according to the first major report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to tally abortion provision in the post-Roe United States. The findings in the report, released Wednesday, echo other research that has uncovered that US abortion rates have surprisingly risen in the years since Roe’s demise. In 2023, the US saw more than 1m abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortions and restrictions on the procedure – the highest number recorded in more than a decade. “It really speaks to a bifurcation of access,” said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a Guttmacher Institute data scientist. “On one hand, you have many states where abortion has gotten incredibly difficult to access – states with total bans, states with six-week bans. Access has gotten much more difficult for people living in those states. And then, on the other hand, you have states with more protective laws where a lot of the things that people have been doing to ameliorate the effects of bans have also increased access to residents of those states.” The CDC report found that US providers performed more than 613,000 abortions in 2022, only a slight drop from the nearly 626,000 abortions performed in 2021. Other metrics of abortion provision also remained similar to past years. Like in the Roe era, the vast majority of abortions took place at or before nine weeks of pregnancy, according to the CDC. Just over 6% of abortions took place 14 to 20 weeks into pregnancy, and about 1% took place at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy. Women in their 20s accounted for the bulk of abortion patients. Almost 60% of abortion patients had also previously given birth. However, the CDC report arrives with a number of asterisks. Its data is not comprehensive, since four states – California, Maryland, New Hampshire and New Jersey – do not supply the agency with data about the abortions performed in their jurisdictions. (The Guttmacher Institute research does include these states.) Some states also do not provide the CDC with demographic data on their abortion patients. The CDC report also does not include data on abortions performed outside of the US healthcare system. Past research has indicated that, in the six months after Roe fell, roughly 26,000 more Americans used pills to induce their own at-home abortions than would have done so if Roe had not collapsed. (Medical experts widely agree that it is safe to self-manage your own abortion using pills early on in pregnancy.) The holes in the CDC data have infuriated some abortion opponents. Project 2025, the infamous playbook of conservative policies, suggests that states lose federal funding if they do not supply the CDC with data on “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method”. It also suggests that the CDC capture data on miscarriages, stillbirths, and “treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child (such as chemotherapy)”. The increased availability of abortion pills almost certainly helps explain why the numbers haven’t fallen. Eight states have enacted “shield laws” that legally protect providers who use telemedicine to mail abortion pills to people living in states with abortion bans. Between April and June 2024, shield laws enabled providers to offer a monthly average of 7,700 telehealth abortions to people in states with total or six-week bans, according to data from #WeCount, a research project by the Society of Family Planning. Despite the national picture, the number of abortions performed in several states that enacted near-total abortion bans after Roe fell dropped precipitously, the CDC found. The number of abortions performed in Alabama, which outlawed almost all abortions midway through 2022, dropped by more than half between 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, states that have become abortion havens started performing far more abortions. Kansas, which borders multiple anti-abortion states, performed almost 5,000 more abortions in 2022 than it did in 2021 – indicating that women in states with abortion bans are traveling for the procedure. “We estimate that, in 2023, around 168,000 people traveled across state lines to access abortion care, which is more than double the number of people who traveled in 2019 or 2020,” Maddow-Zimet said. “It speaks to the way that people are going to really great lengths – often with a lot of support from a lot of other organizations – in order to be able to access abortion care when they need it.” Organizations such as abortion funds have long helped abortion patients pay for travel. However, as outrage over Roe’s demise has died down, many of those funds have begun to run out of money – which could, in turn, lead abortion provision overall to fall. “We have a system right now that’s really reliant on people donating large amounts of money, people working overtime – both providers and support organizations – to get people access,” Maddow-Zimet said. “Whether that is something that can be sustained in the long run, I think is a big question.”","2024-11-27T18:00:09Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/post-roe-abortion-rate"
"abortion","Public health bodies urged to launch period tracking apps to protect data","Public health bodies should launch alternatives to commercial period tracker apps, experts have said, as a report warns women’s personal data is at risk of being harvested by private companies. Smartphone apps that track menstrual cycles are a “goldmine” for consumer profiling, collecting information on everything from exercise, diet and medication to sexual preferences, hormone levels and contraception use, according to the research by the University of Cambridge. And the financial worth of this data is “vastly underestimated” by users who supply profit-driven companies with highly intimate details in a market lacking regulation, the report says. In the wrong hands, cycle tracking app (CTA) data could result in risks to job prospects, workplace monitoring, health insurance discrimination and cyberstalking, and even limit access to abortion, the research suggests. The authors call for better governance of the booming femtech industry to protect users when their data is sold at scale, arguing that apps must provide clear consent options rather than all-or-nothing data collection, and urge public health bodies to launch alternatives to commercial CTAs. “Menstrual cycle tracking apps are presented as empowering women and addressing the gender health gap,” said the report’s lead author, Dr Stefanie Felsberger, of Cambridge’s Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy. “Yet the business model behind their services rests on commercial use, selling user data and insights to third parties for profit. “There are real and frightening privacy and safety risks to women as a result of the commodification of the data collected by cycle tracking app companies.” Most cycle tracking apps are targeted at women aiming to get pregnant, so the download data alone is of huge commercial value, according to the report. Along with homebuying, no other life event is linked to such dramatic shifts in consumer behaviour. Data on pregnancy is believed to be more than 200 times more valuable than data on age, gender or location for targeted advertising. The report says period tracking could also be used to target women at different points in their cycle. The three most popular apps had estimated global download figures of a quarter of a billion in 2024. The femtech market – digital products focused on women’s health and wellbeing – will be worth more than $60bn (£44bn) by 2027, the report says. With such intense demand for period tracking, the authors called on public health bodies including the NHS in the UK to develop their own transparent and trustworthy apps to rival those from private companies, with apps allowing permission for data to be used in medical research. “The UK is ideally positioned to solve the question of access to menstrual data for researchers, as well as privacy and data commodification concerns, by developing an NHS app to track menstrual cycles,” said Felsberger, who added that the reproductive health provider Planned Parenthood in the US already had its own app but the UK lacked an equivalent. “Apps that are situated within public healthcare systems, and not driven primarily by profit, will mitigate privacy violations, provide much-needed data on reproductive health, and give people more agency over how their menstrual data is used.” Prof Gina Neff, the executive director of the Minderoo Centre, said: “The use of cycle tracking apps is at an all-time high. Women deserve better than to have their menstrual tracking data treated as consumer data.” In the UK and EU, period tracking data is considered “special category”, as with that on genetics or ethnicity, and has more legal safeguarding. In the US, data on menstrual cycles has been collected by officials in an attempt to undermine abortion access, the report says.","2025-06-10T23:01:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/11/public-health-bodies-urged-launch-period-tracking-apps-protect-data"
"abortion","Will Jeffrey Epstein’s victims ever get justice?","A tragedy – not a conspiracy Last weekend the terrible news broke that Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein, had died by suicide. Conspiracy theorists immediately started circling. A tweet from 2019, in which Giuffre said she wasn’t suicidal, was dredged up. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldest failson, then amplified the theory to his millions of followers, adding that “other than the Clinton’s [sic] no one has more suiciding going on”. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who seems to wield a huge amount of influence in the Trump administration, also started insinuating online that Giuffre had been silenced by dark forces. “We are never getting the Epstein list, are we?” Loomer tweeted. Various other people amplifying this conspiracy theory have noted that Giuffre isn’t the first Epstein survivor to have died in recent years. In 2023, Carolyn Andriano, who had accused Epstein of abusing her when she was 14 and who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell in her trial, was found dead of an accidental overdose in a Florida hotel room. Andriano testified in 2021 that she had been addicted to “pain pills and cocaine” and taken them “to block out” Epstein’s sexual abuse. Another of Epstein’s victims, Leigh Patrick, also reportedly died of a heroin overdose in Florida in 2017. The fact that three Epstein survivors have died by drug overdose or suicide is enraging and tragic, but it is not a conspiracy. I have a suggestion for the likes of Donald Jr and Loomer: instead of searching for secret plots, why not grapple with some very clear facts? The first being that childhood sexual abuse is associated with a wide range of physical and mental health conditions, including substance abuse. In a statement praising Giuffre’s courage, the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (Rainn) warned that victims of abuse are “significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long term effects of trauma”. The “conspiracy” that Donald Jr and Loomer are searching so hard to find isn’t hidden, it’s staring them right in the face. Far too often, when a woman accuses a powerful man of abuse she will have her life destroyed, while the man walks away. Society is set up to protect powerful predators and their enablers: misogyny is woven into the fabric of all our institutions. Look at the supreme court, where two of the six men serving have faced sexual misconduct allegations. Anita Hill had her reputation destroyed after accusing Clarence Thomas, then a supreme court nominee, of sexually harassing her. Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, was forced to flee her house to protect her safety. (Both justices deny the allegations.) And, of course, look at the White House. Trump was legally branded a sexual predator in 2023 and it didn’t stop him from becoming president again. Look too at all the years that Epstein evaded justice; all the years he rubbed shoulders with some of the most powerful people in the world who didn’t seem to care about his predilection for young girls. Which, by the way, hardly seemed to be a secret. Trump joked about Epstein liking women on the “younger side” back in 2002. Florida prosecutors also reportedly knew that Epstein assaulted young girls years before he cut a very lenient deal with them in 2008. In that deal he pleaded guilty to state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. The financier had to register as a sex offender and serve a 13-month sentence, but was allowed to spend most of his day in his office. I can understand why conspiracy theorists are so obsessed with Epstein. After all, the man operated a vast sex-trafficking ring with the help of an enormous number of powerful people. And yet, five years after the sex offender’s death, the only person to have faced any real consequences is Ghislaine Maxwell, who is in a low-security federal prison. Some high-profile men have been embarrassed, sure, but nobody except Maxwell is in prison. It’s not a conspiracy that’s to blame for this: it’s society’s attitudes toward women. Logan Paul has daughter, realizes that women are human too The influencer, boxer and YouTube personality – who has tens of millions of followers – recently spoke out about how his “mind went to some dark places” when he found out his wife was pregnant with a girl. “I don’t want to come across like a woke asshole, but like, dude, women have it hard,” Paul said on his reality show. “Women have it fucking hard. And I empathize with them.” Jill Sobule dies in a house fire aged 66 The musician’s 1995 single I Kissed a Girl is considered the first openly LGBTQ+-themed song to crack the Billboard top 20 singles chart. Breast cancer is becoming less deadly for younger women in the US From 2010 to 2020, the number of breast cancer deaths among women ages 20-49 dropped significantly, researchers have reported.Breast cancer mortality fell across racial and ethnic groups, but in both 2010 and 2020, non-Hispanic Black women had the highest rate. Why are more than 90% of pilots still men? “Despite more than a decade of initiatives designed to increase the number of women flying planes, just 6.5% of pilots working for UK companies are women,” Amelia Gentleman reports. “There is something stubbornly retro about gender roles in this industry. Female doctors began to outnumber their male peers in the UK for the first time this year, but preconceptions about what an airline pilot should look and sound like have not shifted.” Texas senate approves legislation to clarify exceptions to extreme abortion ban The new legislation, Senate Bill 31, aims to prevent maternal deaths under the state’s strict abortion ban – and serves as an acknowledgment that women were being denied lifesaving care because of confusion about the limits of the abortion ban. While it’s a step forward, don’t get too excited. ProPublica notes: “The bill stops short of removing what doctors say are the ban’s biggest impediments to care, including its major criminal penalties, and doesn’t expand abortion access to cases of fetal anomalies, rape or incest.” The Texas senate has also just passed perhaps the broadest crackdown on abortion-inducing drugs in the country. Judge in Finland dismisses charges against three men accused of raping a 17-year-old girl outside a hospital The girl was taken to Malmi hospital by an ambulance due to her severe intoxication, the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat reports. Three men, two of whom were in their 30s, then took the 17-year-old out of the hospital and had violent intercourse with her, which they filmed. The Helsinki district court has held that the girl – who, again, had been brought to hospital because of intoxication, consented to all this and dismissed the charges against the men. Cory Booker can speak nonstop for 25 hours, but has no comment about genocide The New Jersey senator was heaped with praise by liberals for speaking for 25 hours on the Senate floor last month. “This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said during his speech. “Where do you stand?” Stirring words, indeed. But Booker was awfully quiet this week after Shabtai, the Yale-based society he co-founded, invited the Israeli extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir – a man convicted of terrorism – to give a speech. Booker also took a smiling photo in his office with Yoav Gallant, wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes, in his office last year. Booker is absolutely right that this is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment. You are either for genocide, or you are against it. You are either for starving children and murdering journalists, or you are against it. Booker has made very clear where he stands. If Booker is the “resistance”, we are all in trouble.

"abortion","US supreme court appears divided after hearing arguments on emergency abortion care","For the second time in a month, the US supreme court on Wednesday heard arguments in a major abortion-rights case, the second to reach the justices since they overturned Roe v Wade two years ago. Wednesday’s case involves a 1986 federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or Emtala, which requires hospitals that receive federal dollars to stabilize the health of patients who show up at their emergency rooms with medical emergencies. The Biden administration has sued the state of Idaho, arguing that its ban clashes with Emtala because Idaho only permits abortions in medical emergencies if a woman’s life is at risk – a higher threshold than Emtala. Tensions flared at multiple moments during the two-hour hearing. The court’s three liberal justices – all of whom are women – spent several minutes emphasizing the medical and legal dilemmas unleashed by bans like Idaho’s, while conservative justice Samuel Alito raised an anti-abortion theory that would ultimately lead to the end of abortion writ large. By the end of the hearing, conservative justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared to be the most skeptical of Idaho’s arguments, but the court seemed largely divided along ideological lines. Elizabeth Prelogar, the US solicitor general, emphasized the danger now facing women who show up in crisis at Idaho emergency rooms. “If a woman comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn’t yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to materially deteriorate, or they’re airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs,” Prelogar said. “One hospital system in Idaho says that, right now, it’s having to transfer pregnant woman in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week. That’s untenable and Emtala does not countenance it.” The case is a test of one of the Biden administration’s chief efforts to protect abortion rights. Shortly after the supreme court overturned Roe and allowed states to outlaw abortion, the administration issued guidance clarifying that Emtala requires hospitals everywhere to perform abortions if patients need them in emergencies. A federal judge initially sided with the Biden administration, stopping Idaho from enforcing the parts of the ban that conflicted with Emtala. But the supreme court in January issued an order allowing Idaho’s full abortion ban to take effect. Idaho, which is also represented in the case by the powerful Christian law firm the Alliance Defending Freedom, has argued in court papers that its ban does not conflict with Emtala, in part because Emtala does not mention abortion and cannot compel doctors to offer care that is illegal under state law. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor hammered Joshua N Turner, a lawyer for Idaho, on when and if doctors could intervene in cases where a woman’s health is at risk but her life is not yet threatened. At one point, Sotomayor read off a list of cases of women whose healthcare was delayed due to abortion bans, including the story of a woman whose abortion was delayed to the point that she lost her pregnancy and then had to get a hysterectomy. “You’re telling me the doctor there couldn’t have done the abortion earlier?” Sotomayor asked Turner. “It goes back to whether a doctor can in good faith medical judgment – ” Turner started to say. “That’s a lot for the doctor to risk,” Sotomayor interrupted. A provider who violates Idaho’s ban could face up to five years in prison. Coney Barrett, the sole woman among the conservative majority, seemed taken aback by Turner’s claim that doctor could be prosecuted for performing an abortion in order to protect a woman’s health. While Turner insisted that Idaho’s state legislature did not mean for its ban to apply to doctors acting in good faith to save a woman’s life, Coney Barrett asked: “What if a prosecutor thought differently?” “That, Your Honor, is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,” Turner replied. “And it may result in a case.” Idaho is one of seven states with laws on the books that require a patient’s life to be at risk before an emergency abortion can be performed. Idaho has also argued that Emtala requires providers to treat an “unborn child”. Justice Samuel Alito, a diehard conservative, brought up that phrase, indicating that Emtala is meant to imply that doctors have two equal patients when a pregnant woman shows up at an ER: the woman and her fetus. “It seems that the plain meaning is that the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child, but performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty,” Alito said. Prelogar insisted that phrase, added to Emtala in 1989, was meant to ensure that hospitals treated women whose fetuses were in crisis while they were not. “The statute did nothing to displace the woman herself as an individual with an emergency medical condition,” Prelogar replied. “And in many of the cases you’re thinking about, there is no possible way to stabilize the unborn child because the fetus is sufficiently before viability that it’s inevitable that the pregnancy is going to be lost.” The pair went back and forth for several minutes before Alito added: “Nobody is suggesting that a woman isn’t an individual, that she doesn’t deserve stabilization.” But the exchange evoked the specter of fetal personhood, a priority of the anti-abortion movement that aims to endow fetuses with full legal rights and protections – even if those rights conflict with those of the woman carrying the fetus. Enshrining fetal personhood across the US – which is also a goal of the anti-abortion movement – would dramatically rewrite vast swaths of US law and ban abortion entirely. The consequences for abortions in medical emergencies, like those at issue in the Wednesday arguments, are unclear; although anti-abortion activists have spent years pursuing fetal personhood, the end of Roe has forced them – and the rest of the nation – to reckon for the first time with its real-world consequences. Wednesday’s hearing comes just weeks after the court heard arguments in another abortion rights case, which involved the availability of a common abortion pill and the Food and Drug Administration’s ability to regulate it. Lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom also argued that case on behalf of anti-abortion activists. Both arguments have significant implications for the federal government’s power to regulate healthcare. If anti-abortion states prevail, “you’re basically deconstructing the entire way that we manage health nationally in this country,” said Gerson Smoger, chair of the Physicians for Human Rights board of directors anda co-author of an amicus brief in the Idaho case. “There has to be some baseline that we have, nationally.” Rulings in both the Emtala and abortion pill cases are expected in June.","2024-04-24T17:25:45Z","https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/apr/24/us-supreme-court-abortion-rights-emtala"
"abortion","What’s at stake in emergency abortion care case before US supreme court?","The supreme court heard its second abortion rights case of the term on Wednesday, this one focused on how states can regulate emergency abortions – exceedingly rare procedures that often save a woman’s life or her future fertility. The case may seem technical because it focuses on a small subset of emergency abortions and federal law that governs emergency room care. However, if the court finds in favor of anti-abortion states, it could upend emergency care for millions of pregnant women and undermine the federal government’s ability to regulate emergency medicine. Here’s what you need to know about the law The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (Emtala) is a federal law that requires doctors and hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment to patients facing serious threats to life and limb, regardless of their ability to pay, or lose federal funding. The law grew out of “patient dumping” in the 1980s, when private hospitals transferred patients who could not pay, including women in active labor, to public counterparts. Idaho’s strict abortion ban only allows doctors to intervene in near-death cases Emtala requires doctors to stabilize patients if they face a threat to life or limb. If a patient’s health could be seriously impaired in the future – for example, if a pregnant woman could lose her uterus unless she receives an abortion – an emergency room must make an effort to treat that threat to health. This requirement directly conflicts with Idaho’s abortion ban, which only allows doctors to terminate a pregnancy to prevent death. Otherwise, doctors could face prosecution and loss of their medical license. So, how can healthcare providers comply with Emtala and Idaho’s law? Lawyers for Idaho say there is no conflict. Because doctors must work within the bounds of state licensing boards, Idaho’s attorneys said they could comply with Emtala by simply following Idaho’s imminent death standard. Female justices appeared especially skeptical. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the conservative wing, asked Idaho’s deputy solicitor general, Joshua Turner, if a doctor would face criminal charges if they treated a woman who could lose her uterus but not die. Not if a doctor was “exercising their medical judgment to determine life-saving care was necessary”, Turner said. “What if the prosecutor thought differently?” asked Coney Barrett. “That is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,” said Turner. The federal government says Idaho’s law is dangerous Lawyers for the federal government vehemently disagreed and Turner’s assurances that doctors could exercise medical judgment do not square with reality, said the Biden administration’s solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar. “Idaho has directly interfered with the ability of hospitals to accept these federal funds and fulfill Congress’s desire that no matter where you are in this country you can go to an ER and be stabilized,” said Prelogar. Doctors in Idaho are so scared of treating pregnant patients that the state’s largest emergency care department is regularly airlifting women to Utah, Prelogar said. Utah also has an abortion ban, but it makes an exception for women’s health, and therefore does not conflict with Emtala. At least six more states have abortion bans that do not make an exception for women’s health, Prelogar said, though not all are in effect. Herein lies some of this case’s most pernicious implications – if doctors do not feel safe, then treating any pregnant patient in an abortion ban state becomes a high-risk proposition. It means women will be and already are being turned away from emergency rooms – endangering one of the populations Congress sought to protect. The court appears divided Whether the court will side with anti-abortion states or the federal government is unclear. The court’s three liberals are almost certain to vote against anti-abortion states. At least one conservative, Coney Barrett, also appeared skeptical. The conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas appeared supportive of Idaho. The votes of three more conservative justices are less clear. Liberals will need at least two conservatives to join them to protect emergency care as Americans know it today.","2024-04-24T21:48:10Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/24/emergency-abortion-care-us-supreme-court-what-to-know"
"abortion","‘Thought crime’ and cancelled elections: how do JD Vance’s claims about Europe stand up?","In JD Vance’s confrontational and pugnacious speech at the Munich Security Conference, the vice-president ran through a series of examples to highlight his claims that Europe has gone off the rails. Here, we look at what he said – and whether it stacks up. United Kingdom Speaking about “our very dear friends, the United Kingdom”, Vance claimed a “backslide away from conscience rights” had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons in particular in the crosshairs”. The British government, he said, had charged Adam Smith-Conner, a physiotherapist and an army veteran, with the “heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own”. Vance claimed that Conner told an “unmoved” law enforcement officer that he was praying for an unborn son that he and a former girlfriend had aborted years before. “Adam was found guilty of breaking the government’s new ‘buffer zones law’, which criminalises silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person’s decision within 200 metres of an abortion facility,” Vance said. “He was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution.” Fact check Smith-Connor was convicted of breaching a safe zone in October last year, after refusing repeated requests to move away from outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022. The 51-year-old told the council the day before he would be carrying out a silent vigil as he had on previous occasions. On the day, a community officer spoke to him for an hour and 40 minutes and asked him to leave – but he refused. Smith-Connor was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay more than £9,000 costs after the case was brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council. Smith-Connor is receiving legal support from Alliance Defending Freedom International, an American conservative Christian legal advocacy group that states it “champions religious freedom through … advocacy efforts”. ADF International said it would be supporting Smith-Connor to appeal against the decision in July. Smith-Connor’s case was brought after a public space protection order was introduced outside the Bournemouth clinic in October 2022, which banned activity including protests, harassment and vigils. October last year saw the introduction of the Public Order Act 2023 in England and Wales, which introduced buffer zones of 150 metres around abortion clinics to stop women being harassed with leaflets, shown pictures of foetuses, or having to pass by vigils. Scotland The Scottish government was said to have begun distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. He went on: “The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe.” Fact check The Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Act, introduced last year, introduced safe access zones within 200 metres of abortion clinics, banning harassing, alarming or distressing actions. “Silent prayer” is listed among the banned activities to prevent mass silent vigils that have been used by large groups of US anti-abortion protesters such as 40 Days for Life who gather outside clinics to pressure women entering not to have an abortion. A Conservative US TikToker erroneously claimed that silent prayer at home could break the law in Scotland. However the law states that the actions are banned if they are likely to cause alarm or distress to someone accessing abortion services. Silent prayer in a home which caused no distress and alarm to other would not fall under this category. A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The vice-president’s claim is incorrect. Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was.” Romania Vance told the Munich security conference that a former European commissioner had “sounded delighted” that an “entire election” in Romania had been annulled. Vance added: “He warned that if things don’t go to plan, the very same thing could happen in Germany too … But when we see European courts cancelling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others, we ought to ask whether we’re holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard.” Fact check The US vice-president was referring to comments by the former European commissioner Thierry Breton. The former French minister had been speaking after the decision by Romania’s constitutional court in December to annul the early results of the country’s presidential election. The court had intervened after declassified intelligence documents pointed to what was described as a massive and “highly organised” campaign for the independent candidate Călin Georgescu, on the TikTok platform that was probably orchestrated by a “state actor”. Georgescu has committed to stop all Romanian political and military support for Ukraine if elected. Commenting on the case, Breton had said: “Let’s keep calm and enforce our laws in Europe when they are at risk of being circumvented … We did it in Romania, and we will obviously do it if necessary in Germany.” Elon Musk intervened at the time on X, referring to “the staggering absurdity of Thierry Breton as the tyrant of Europe”. Breton responded: “Tyrant of Europe? Wow! But No Elon Musk: the EU has NO mechanism to nullify any election anywhere in EU. Not at all what is said in the video below related only to the application of the [Digital Services Act] and its moderation obligations. Lost in translation… or another fake news?” Brussels Vance said that in Brussels “EU Commission commissars” had warned citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest at “the moment they spot what they’ve judged to be ‘hateful content’”. In Germany, he claimed police had carried out “raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of ‘combating misogyny’ on the internet”. Fact check Under the Digital Services Act, the European Commission can ask a digital services coordinator in an EU member state to ask a judge to assess an application for a temporary restriction on access within the EU to a large online platform or search engine. The commission does also have the power to bypass the judge-led process in an “urgent situation”. The commission has said that such an extreme measure must “follow the due process” and “would be limited in time”. Restrictions on services can only be enforced where there is evidence of criminal offences involving threat to people’s life or safety. Should the commission use its enforcement powers, its decisions are subject to judicial redress at the European court of justice. German police carried out raids last March on the homes of people suspected of posting misogynistic hate speech on the internet, including those advocating rape or sexual assault. Police raided homes and interrogated 45 suspects in 11 states. None of the suspects were detained. Sweden Vance said “the government” had “convicted a Christian activist for participating in Qur’an burnings that resulted in his friend’s murder”. He went on: “And as the judge in his case chillingly noted, Sweden’s laws to supposedly protect free expression do not, in fact, grant – and I’m quoting – a ‘free pass’ to do or say anything without risking offending the group that holds that belief.” Fact check Salwan Najem was given a suspended sentence and a fine by a court over statements he made in connection with four incidents of Qur’an burning in Stockholm. He had carried out the book burning with Salwan Momika, who was subsequently shot dead during a TikTok broadcast last month. Najem, who came to Sweden from Iraq in 1998 and has been a Swedish citizen since June 2005, told the court that his actions were legitimate criticisms of religion protected by Sweden’s freedom of expression laws. Göran Lundahl, the judge in the case, said freedom of expression did not constitute a “free pass to do or say anything”. Germany Vance cited the recent attack in Munich as reason for a “new direction”, suggesting the attack was typical. “An asylum seeker, often a young man in his mid-20s, already known to police, rammed a car into a crowd and shatters a community”, he said. Fact check German police and prosecutors have said that an Afghan suspect in a car ramming in central Munich that injured at least 36 people was believed to have had an “Islamist” motive and will answer to charges of attempted murder. They have not found links to a jihadist organisation such as the Islamic State group nor any accomplices. According to the latest EU terrorism situation and trend report from Europol, there were a total of 120 terrorist attacks (98 completed, nine failed and 13 foiled) in seven EU member states in 2023. The highest number of terrorist attacks were perpetrated by separatist terrorists (70, all completed), followed by leftwing and anarchist actors (32, of which 23 completed). There were 14 jihadist terrorist attacks of which five were completed. Two rightwing terrorist attacks were foiled.","2025-02-14T19:23:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/14/thought-and-cancelled-elections-how-do-jd-vances-europe-claims-stand-up"
"abortion","Democrats move to repeal 1873 law they say could pave way for national abortion ban","Democrats introduced legislation on Thursday to repeal a 19th-century anti-obscenity law that bans mailing abortion-related materials, amid growing worries that anti-abortion activists will use the law to implement a federal abortion ban. The bill to repeal the Comstock Act was introduced by the Minnesota Democratic senator Tina Smith, whose office provided a draft copy of the legislation to the Guardian. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Nevada senator Catherine Cortez Masto also back the bill, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the news of Smith’s plans. Companion legislation was also set to be introduced in the House. “We have to see that these anti-choice extremists are intending to misapply the Comstock Act,” Smith said in an interview. “And so our job is to draw attention to that, and to do everything that we can to stop them.” Passed in 1873, the Comstock Act is named after the anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock and, in its original iteration, broadly banned people from using the mail to send anything “obscene, lewd or lascivious”, including “any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring an abortion”. In the 151 years since its enactment, legal rulings and congressional action narrowed the scope of the Comstock Act. For years, legal experts regarded it as a dead letter, especially when Roe v Wade established the constitutional right to an abortion. But after the US supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, some anti-abortion activists started arguing that the Comstock Act’s prohibition against mailing abortion-related materials remained good law. Project 2025, a playbook written by the influential thinktank the Heritage Foundation, recommends that a future conservative presidential administration use the Comstock Act to block the mailing of abortion pills. Other activists have gone even further, arguing that the Comstock Act can outlaw the mailing of all abortion-related materials. Because abortion clinics rely on the mail for the drugs and tools they need to do their work, such an interpretation of the Comstock Act would be a de facto ban on all abortion. The Biden administration has issued guidance arguing that someone only violates the Comstock Act if the sender intends for abortion-related materials “to be used unlawfully”. However, although Joe Biden has focused his re-election campaign on reproductive rights, he has steered clear of addressing the potential return of the Comstock Act. Smith said that it “seems impossible” that her repeal bill will garner the 60 votes necessary to advance legislation in the Senate. Republicans recently stymied Democratic efforts to establish federal rights to contraception and in vitro fertilization. But Smith views her bill as a chance to raise awareness of the nationwide consequences of a Comstock Act revival, particularly among voters living in states where abortion rights are currently protected. “You talk to somebody in Minnesota or Nevada or Pennsylvania, places where people feel secure that they have control over their own decisions and their own potential to decide for themselves about abortion – and then come to find out that Donald Trump has a plan to take away that control that you have, even without a vote or an act of Congress,” Smith said. “It makes it much more real, what the difference is and what the contrast is, what the choices are for you even in those states where state law protects you. That could all change.” In a New York Times April op-ed where she first aired her plans to repeal the Comstock Act, Smith suggested that she planned to introduce the legislation once the supreme court ruled on a case involving access to mifepristone, one of the two drugs typically used in US medication abortions and a top target of anti-abortion activists. In a unanimous opinion earlier this month, the supreme court ruled on technical grounds to let access to mifepristone remain unchanged for now. Although rightwing justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito brought up the Comstock Act during oral arguments in the case, neither the majority opinion nor a concurrence by Thomas ultimately mentioned the anti-obscenity law. “The court, in its decision, left the door wide open for future challenges based on Comstock,” Smith said, adding: “There was nothing in the court’s decision that gave me any sense of security.”","2024-06-20T17:41:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/20/comstock-act-democrats"
"abortion","‘Explicit and outrageous’: South Park is back with its most gratuitous episode since naked Trump","Even outside its notoriously tight weekly production schedule, South Park has always run on an unpredictable calendar, sometimes taking years between seasons. This time around, it’s jumping from one season to the next after only five episodes (which, granted, have come in bi-monthly instalments, not counting the abrupt season finale that was pushed back a week due to a blown deadline). Tonight’s episode, titled Twisted Christian, kicks off season 28. At South Park Elementary, PC Principal – the PC standing for Power Christian ever since his politically motivated conversion at the start of last season – attempts to put a stop to his students’ obsession with the “6-7” TikTok meme, not because it is insufferable or disruptive, but because he considers it “some satanic numerology shit”. Rather than seeking help from the school’s new guidance counsellor, Jesus Christ, he turns to the world’s top expert on the antichrist: billionaire Peter Thiel. (The show’s caricature of Thiel – sunken skeletal visage with bulging bug eyes – is up there with Kristi Noem’s from earlier this year in terms of viciousness.) Thiel dives into the lore of the antichrist, revealing that God’s punishment of Satan after the war in heaven was to shrink his butthole down to the size of a pinhole, “so that [he] could never have a butt baby … until along came Mr Donald Trump, whose penis is so teeny-teeny-tiny it could actually fit in Satan’s asshole.” The size of Trump’s penis? Somewhere between 6-7cm. All of this is foretold in Revelation 6:7, natch. We’re also shown a scheming JD Vance, who seems to be the one pulling the strings rather than Satan or Trump. He is doing everything in his power to stop the birth of his boss’s unholy spawn, including giving his benefactor Thiel unlimited access to every government database while also convincing Trump to seek out an abortion. Donald Trump takes a back seat to other characters here, although several scenes are dedicated to his nether regions (including a couple of attempts at masturbation with the help of a pair of tweezers), making this by far the most explicit and outrageous episode since the last season premiere. Meanwhile, back in South Park, Jesus suffers a crisis of faith after spending time with PC Principal and other Maga Christians (“You need a way to bully people and you’re using the Bible to do it!”), while Eric Cartman’s unhealthy obsession with the “6-7” meme turns into a full-blown case of demonic possession, replete with violent projectile vomiting a la The Exorcist. It turns out he may have the key to stopping the apocalypse. Jesus eventually gives in to peer pressure and embraces a Christian bro lifestyle, while Cartman heads to DC, where a face-to-face with Trump is all but inevitable. Even though it picked up from where the last episode left off, this had the feel of a season premiere, setting all the pieces in place for the remaining five episodes and what is sure to be a wild conclusion. As evidenced by the feature film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut and the season 11 Imaginationland saga, South Park is capable of telling legitimately epic stories, and the one they’re currently in the middle of has all the makings of another classic.","2025-10-16T12:08:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/16/explicit-and-outrageous-south-park-is-back-with-its-most-gratuitous-episode-since-naked-trump"
"abortion","‘Mama bears are rising up’: the rightwing Christian entrepreneur aiming for a takeover of local US government","At a Los Angeles church in October 2023, Jenny Donnelly, a Christian entrepreneur and charismatic preacher, addressed a room full of women with a lofty idea. “Why don’t we send a million women into the school boards?” The audience had convened to hear Donnelly, a multi-level marketer turned rising star on the Christian right, offer her vision for a conservative movement of moms determined to push back against policies such as LGBTQ+ inclusion and abortion rights. Such a movement, Donnelly proclaimed, would be rooted in the “billion soul harvest”, referring to a prophetic, end-times vision of mass revival introduced by US evangelists in the early 2000s. In the year since, Donnelly has developed a sprawling network of moms through a strategic but largely under-the-radar organizing infrastructure made up of small groups across the country called “prayer hubs”. She has secured the backing of heavy-hitting rightwing Christian activists and donors and says her goal is to train women to run for office locally while establishing a national mass of parents ready to mobilize in the streets against LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion. Donnelly has found a political and religious home among the leaders and church networks associated with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a movement that seeks to install conservative Christians as leaders in governmental and cultural institutions. NAR leaders such as Donnelly are “very good at what they do, and they have mastered the art of gaining mass followings that are not highly geographically concentrated”, said Matthew Taylor, a fellow at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies whose research focuses on charismatic Christian networks. “That gives them a great deal of political power – if, when and where they decide to deploy it.” According to footage of Her Voice Movement meetings reviewed by the Guardian and Documented, Donnelly’s organization has in the last three years established more than 7,000 organizing hubs across the country. The group grew dramatically in the months before the election with the support of financing from the secretive Christian donor network Ziklag – which sought to expand the Her Voice Movement in key battleground states to help elect Donald Trump, according to internal Ziklag videos obtained by the Guardian and Documented. Looking toward and beyond the 2024 election, leaders of Ziklag took notice of the Her Voice Movement’s potential in the larger culture wars, promising that Donnelly would, in part, “ignite and fuel an epic movement”. ‘Girlboss mom engaged in a spiritual war’ In Donnelly’s telling, Her Voice Movement was born in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, forces that closed her church and traumatized her community. Although it is unclear how a protest movement against police brutality would have impacted her church – and Donnelly did not return requests for comment – the idea of a movement on the left that was capable of amassing national attention proved extremely motivating. “For over 180 days straight, my hometown, of Portland, Oregon, was dominated and destroyed by this group, simply because of this: they had a unified battle plan, with enough people executing it,” says Donnelly in a video promoting Her Voice Movement. “The church needs a unified battle plan.” With the right amount of coordination, perhaps Christians – and in particular, Christian women – could garner support for a movement of their own, making demands around issues such as abortion and transgender rights, which Donnelly opposes. Donnelly already had experience with a certain kind of organizing: as a successful multi-level marketer who earned enough revenue to propel her family into affluence. From 1999, when she joined the nutritional supplement company AdvoCare as a “distributor”, until the firm’s dissolution amid multiple lawsuits alleging it was an illegal pyramid scheme, Donnelly earned millions – an exhilarating venture. According to a 2017 lawsuit that named Donnelly and other early AdvoCare distributors as defendants, Donnelly described the experience as akin to “jumping in a new Lamborghini and with no speed limit on the freeway and you are just zipping as fast as you want to go because your foot’s on the gas pedal”. Donnelly was later dropped as a defendant, but AdvoCare, which was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for allegedly defrauding its lower-level distributors, collapsed – and Donnelly poured her efforts into godlier places. The Oregon marketer and her husband founded two groups: a church, called Collective church, and a Christian non-profit registered under the name Tetelestai Ministries. Through Tetelestai, Donnelly offers courses on relationships, wellness, healthy eating and even interpreting dreams. In 2021, the Donnellys “commissioned” another couple to lead Collective church and stepped into an oversight role. Donnelly’s church and Tetelestai Ministries, form part of a rapidly growing non-denominational Christian movement that embraces modern-day prophets and apostles and emphasizes direct encounters with God, faith healing, speaking in tongues and the belief in demons. Like Donnelly, many other prophets, apostles and preachers of the “neo-charismatic” and New Apostolic Reformation movements lean into popular culture and fluently deploy social media to connect with believers online. Much of Donnelly’s social media content is aspirational: glamorous photos of Donnelly, who is blond and immaculately put together, an image of her children showing off Her Voice Movement swag, a grateful post dedicated to her husband for gifting her an enormous painting of Jesus to decorate the wall above her “prayer chair”. In the Pentecostal and charismatic movements, “there’s a long tradition of glamorous women using mass media to do political activism and to do revival meetings,” said Leah Payne, an associate professor of religious history at Portland Seminary. “As a Charismatic, [Donnelly] is culturally very familiar with how to use new media and new media platforms.” When she’s preaching to the Christian moms who form the core of her followers, Donnelly talks about relationship struggles, lends a voice to the pressures of parenting and offers testimony about her own trauma and salvation. “I got to be about 20 years old and then everything caved in, I found myself wanting to take my own life,” said Donnelly at a Pentecostal church event in Colorado this summer. An encounter with Jesus, she testified, helped her heal from the lingering pain of her parents’ divorce and the feeling that her father had abandoned her. “What’s really compelling about what she does is that she interweaves activism into her status as a mother, and her status as a woman – so she’s combining this ‘girlboss’ feminism with our culture’s enthusiasm for very attentive parenting,” said Payne. “She’s a girlboss mom who is engaged in a spiritual war for her children, and not just her children – all children.” Donnelly frequently sermonizes about what she believes form the most serious dilemmas for American children: anxiety, depression and pornography – but also cultural affirmation of LGBTQ+ identities, which Donnelly claims are the product of demonic possession. At the center of Donnelly’s organization are “prayer hubs”, groups of two to 10 people who gather on at least a monthly basis to pray, working from Donnelly’s prayer guides and chatting on the organization’s app, which functions as a clearinghouse for news, meetings and events. Convening under the nickname “mama bears”, the prayer hub activists position themselves as devout but aggrieved protectors of children. “This nation is headed in a direction that is a direct threat to our freedom, especially for our children and our grandchildren,” Donnelly says in a video promoting the prayer hubs. “We are inviting you to join us in a strategy that has the devil running scared. Because when this works, our nation will turn back to God and our freedoms will be preserved.” With goals that lofty, the mama bears would need powerful allies. ‘A bunch of frothing females’ Donnelly’s network quickly became a topic of conversation among the leaders of Ziklag, a secretive and influential Christian donor network that has spent millions on ultraconservative causes. As the group developed a strategy to drive evangelical turnout in the 2024 election to help elect Trump, Ziklag leaders turned to Donnelly’s network of women as a political organizing tool. Donnelly, who had incorporated Her Voice Action, Inc in June 2024 as the political wing of the women’s network, was well-positioned to take on such partisan work. On the first Her Voice Action call in July, Donnelly explained how the group would allow the network to get into more overtly political activism, with the goal of “educating, equipping and activating as many men and women as possible”. “Maybe it’s the school board, maybe it’s city council. Maybe you’re going to go to the library and start booking some story reading hours,” said Donnelly. “We’ve got to get on offense and have our voices carried all over America.” In an internal video promoting its projects to donors, Ziklag proposed to “support and repurpose these hubs for frontline organizing”, a project the group internally referred to as the “Mama Bear” initiative. Ziklag pledged $400,000 for this initiative, though it is not immediately clear how much went directly to Donnelly’s group, understanding that the network of conservative moms had influence and could impact get-out-the-vote efforts in key swing states. Leaders of Ziklag praised Donnelly’s tenacity and ability to organize women, suggesting their donations could “pour fuel” on the work Donnelly had started. Drew Hiss, executive director of Ziklag, put it bluntly. “We’ve got a bunch of frothing females who are all about Don’t Mess with My Kids,” said Hiss, during a strategy call. “And we wanna help.” In addition to Ziklag, Her Voice Movement has formed alliances with influential Christian power-building hubs, activists and pastors. An internal video produced by Ziklag and reviewed by the Guardian and Documented proposed training Donnelly’s prayer hub activists alongside the Trump-allied organizations America First Policy institute and America First Works, and John Amanchukwu, a school board activist who has fought for book bans in schools across the country. Amanchukwu appeared in the July Her Voice Action strategy call, encouraging the women to quit playing the role of “nice Christians” and reclaim schools and communities through confrontation. “Faithful Christians realize that we are living in the last and evil days and Satan has the family in his crosshairs,” said Amanchukwu. Donnelly and her team have also developed a relationship with Christians Engaged, a conservative Christian non-profit that produces voter guides and offers candidate training programs. In advance of the 2024 elections, Bunni Pounds, the director of Christians Engaged, appeared as a guest on the Her Voice Action to strategize get-out-the-vote initiatives. To encourage members to get to the polls, HVM coordinated with Christians Engage to promote a voting pledge prominently on the group’s app. Lance Wallnau, a self-proclaimed prophet who has been funded by Ziklag and organized events for Trump in swing states this year, was an early supporter of Donnelly. “We better pay attention, because the mama bears are rising up,” said Wallnau during a Ziklag strategy call. ‘We can’t sit back’ Her Voice Movement has had a meteoric rise. Since 2020, Tetelestai Ministries, the Her Voice Movement umbrella group, has increased its funding by more than 250%, pulling in more than $2.2m in 2023. As the organization grows, Donnelly has directed the group toward explicitly political aims, turning her prayer hubs into political organizing hubs. “Just like we have the air game, we also have a ground game,” said Donnelly during the July 2024 Zoom call. The “air game” – prayer – would be bolstered by a political effort mobilizing members through the newly founded political wing of the group. Her Voice Movement is modeled after a push by charismatic and evangelical pastors in Peru called “No te metas con mis hijos,” or “Don’t mess with my kids” – a nod to the myth that LGBTQ+ activists covertly attempt to turn children trans and gay through the public school system. Donnelly has described her efforts as “copy-pasting” the tactics of the Peruvian movement, and has coordinated closely with Christian Rosas, a conservative Peruvian political operative who was involved with the movement there. Her Voice Movement’s first national action took place on 13 April, with members holding simultaneous rallies at the state capitols. The actions, which had been coordinated with the anti-LGBTQ+ parental rights group Moms for Liberty, drew only modest attendance but offered the group an opportunity to test its ability to mobilize politically. For at least a year, Donnelly planned a mass rally on the National Mall for October 2024 – coordinating with some of the movement’s most influential leaders, including the notorious anti-LGBTQ+ pastor, Lou Engle, to draw “a million women” to Washington DC. Ché Ahn, a California-based pastor and the leader of a sprawling and enormous network of churches and ministries spanning more than 60 countries, would play a prominent role at the rally as well. With Ahn’s network, Engle’s experience summoning mass prayer gatherings and Donnelly’s own growing spiritual network, the Christian moms movement pulled off a major day-long rally. They may not have convened “a million women” – police estimates placed the event at closer to 50,000 – but the group was able to hold down a long stretch of the mall for an event that drew a diverse and even international group. On a December Her Voice Action call, Donnelly highlighted that since March, the organization has doubled the number of prayer hubs around the country, jumping from 3,500 to 7,000. If Donnelly’s figures are correct, Her Voice Movement could, in its infancy, already retain tens of thousands of members. Pointing to an influx in funding, Donnelly hired state directors in swing states to create “super hubs” and grow the existing infrastructure. Donnelly played up Her Voice Movement’s impact on the election during the call. “We look at the elections, and we look at every battleground state went red – I am telling you right now, we know why that happened. Not just because of Her Voice Movement, I would never be that ignorant to think it was just Her Voice Movement, but I can tell you that we had a large, large piece to play. Because why? Committed prayer hubs and lots of them.” Between the success of the October rally and Trump’s win, Donnelly had proof of concept. The group has planned anti-trans “Don’t Mess with Our Kids” marches in Miami, Houston, New York, Seattle and Los Angeles in early 2025. Donnelly also urged members of the group to “double down” on efforts before the midterms and 2028 elections. In the meantime, they would build out a public-facing campaign against LGBTQ+ inclusion, mimicking the kind of direct action tactics that LGBTQ+ people have employed for decades. “When the Pride community wanted their own month of June, a proclamation across America, they did not silently hope this was going to happen – they went into the streets. They started parades. They got permits. They did all the things that are actually available to us,” said Donnelly. “We can’t sit back and just kind of hope that they give up.” This article was produced in partnership with Documented, an investigative watchdog and journalism project.

"abortion","Where do Harris and Trump stand on the key election issues?","Kamala Harris and Donald Trump offer two starkly different visions for the country with much at stake – from pocketbook economic issues and reproductive rights to the strength of the country’s global alliances and existential questions about the future of American democracy and the planet. As they compete for the White House, both candidates have laid out their plans in speeches, campaign ads and media interviews. Most of it amounts to a wish list, sketched out in broad strokes and lacking concrete details about how they would be implemented or paid for. A number of Trump’s proposals raise legal questions, while some of Harris’s would probably require Democratic control of Congress. * * * Kamala Harris policies on the economy On the top issue for voters this election, Harris is tied to the Biden administration’s record on the economy – for better or worse. But she has proposed her own set of targeted economic plans to lower costs. Inflation: While the overall economic picture has brightened in recent months, Harris has said she agrees with Americans that prices are “still too high” after several years of significant inflation. Harris says she wants to build up the “opportunity economy,”, focused on the middle class, with plans to combat price gouging, boost housing development, aid first-time homebuyers, expand tax credits for parents and expand Medicare to cover in-home senior care. Taxes: Harris has pledged to cut taxes for tens of millions of middle- and low-income families, while saying she supports tax breaks for entrepreneurs and small business owners. She also backs a proposal championed by Trump to eliminate taxes on tips. Harris has called for the corporate tax rate to be raised to 28%, up from 21%. Trade: Harris is expected to maintain the Biden administration’s approach, relying on tariffs and export controls to boost domestic competitiveness with China. On the campaign trail, she has also touted the Biden administration’s ambitious investments in infrastructure and renewable energy. Donald Trump policies on the economy Trump continues to tout his pre-pandemic record. Inflation: Much of Trump’s inflation-reduction plan hinges on his vow to slash energy costs by expanding oil and gas drilling and deregulation, though economists say his plans for sweeping tariffs and mass deportations could actually raise costs. He has also been highly critical of high interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s main inflation-fighting tool. Trump said recently that he thinks the president should have a say in decisions made by the Fed, which traditionally operates independently from politics. Taxes: In a second term, he has vowed to extend and expand a suite of tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, while pledging to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% for companies that make their products in the US. He has also said he would exempt Social Security benefits and overtime pay, in addition to tips, from income taxes. Trade and tariffs: Trump has called himself as the “tariff man”, casting such taxes as the answer to the country’s myriad economic problems, from revitalizing a sagging auto industry to bringing down the high cost of childcare. The former president has suggested an across-the-board levy of perhaps 10% and up to 20% on virtually all foreign-made goods, as well as slapping tariffs of 60% – or more – on goods from China, an approach the Economist called a “protectionist nightmare”. He has said he would ask Congress for the authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposes one on the US. * * * Kamala Harris policies on abortion Harris was a vocal proponent of reproductive rights before she became the nominee, assailing Trump and Republicans for creating a “healthcare crisis” that has led to the preventable deaths of women seeking abortion care. Roe v Wade and abortion bans: As a candidate, she has called on Congress to pass legislation to restore the protections of Roe v Wade, which the supreme court overturned in 2022. Doing so would reinstate the Roe-era status quo, in effect blocking states from banning abortion before fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. As president, Harris has vowed she would veto any nationwide abortion ban. IVF: Harris has pledged to protect the full spectrum of reproductive healthcare, including access to contraception and other fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). She has also touted efforts by the Biden-Harris administration to safeguard access to medical abortion and protect women who cross state lines to access the procedure. Donald Trump policies on abortion Trump has alternately bragged about his role appointing three supreme court justices whose votes were decisive in overturning Roe while also complaining that bans on abortion in Republican-controlled states may hurt him electorally. Roe v Wade and abortion bans: Trump has said abortion access should be left to the states, and has vowed that as president he would not sign a national abortion ban. (Weeks before making that pledge, he refused to say whether he would veto such a ban.) IVF: He has also said that if he wins he would make IVF free for women, though has provided few specifics and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation that would protect the treatment. Abortion pills: Project 2025, the 900-page conservative blueprint for the next Republican president, suggests using a 19th-century anti-vice law to ban the mailing of abortion pills, which account for two-thirds of US abortions. Because this law is already on the books, a President Trump could enforce it without congressional action. Trump has said “generally speaking” he would not enforce the law, but had previously expressed an openness to curbing access. * * * Kamala Harris policies on democracy Harris has called Trump a “fascist” seeking a return to “unchecked power”. She staged her closing argument at the Ellipse, the precise spot from which Trump had fomented a violent assault on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Harris has warned that Trump would arrive in office with an “enemies list” and has called his violent rhetoric against political opponents “disqualifying”. Reform: Harris has said that she is willing to eliminate the filibuster to codify abortion rights, a reform many Democrats believe would help ease some of the legislative gridlock in Congress. Voting rights: As vice-president, she led the push to pass federal voting rights legislation, but the effort stalled. Donald Trump policies on democracy Election denialism: Trump has never stopped fully repeating the lie that his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden was marred by fraud. He has refused to say whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election, and he and his allies are already laying the groundwork to deny an electoral defeat. In comments that have alarmed experts and scholars, Trump has threatened to jail his political opponents and turn the military against US citizens. He has also pledged to pardon defendants convicted for their roles in the January 6 attack, which he recently called a “day of love”. Trump, meanwhile, is facing federal charges over his attempt to overturn the results of the election, including his actions related to the violent Capitol assault. Trump, who has signaled his intention to surround himself with loyalists, has said he would retaliate against his political opponents, threatening to use the justice department to prosecute Democratic lawyers, elections officials, donors and even voters. This would be a sharp break from Democratic norms in the United States, where federal law enforcement is supposed to be apolitical. * * * Kamala Harris policies on border security and immigration Harris has sought to flip the script on immigration, one of her biggest political vulnerabilities. Border security: During a visit to the border in September, she laid out a plan to enact stricter penalties for people who attempt to claim asylum between lawful ports of entry. Arrests of people for crossing the southern border reached record levels during the early years of the Biden administration, but have fallen sharply since he implemented an asylum clampdown. As vice-president, Harris was tasked with addressing the root causes of migration. Trump and Republicans blame her for the situation at the border, describing it as overrun as a result of Biden’s overly lenient immigration policies. Immigration reform: A former California senator, Harris has long championed comprehensive immigration reform, including pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, especially those who were brought to the US as children. Donald Trump policies on border security and immigration Immigration is Trump’s signature issue. In a second term, he has vowed to go much further than he did four years ago. Deportation: He has promised to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in US history, a policy that would face logistical, legal and financial hurdles while tearing apart families and unleashing fear throughout immigrant communities. He has said he would reinstate several controversial policies from his first term, including the Remain in Mexico program, Title 42 and a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority nations. He has vowed to rescind programs that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation, including children, while revoking the legal status of potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the US under the federal temporary protected status program. Trump has also suggested he would end birthright citizenship for the US-born children of undocumented immigrants – a proposal that experts say is unlikely to prevail in court – and impose “ideological screenings” for immigrants. Anti-immigrant sentiment: Beyond his policy, Trump has used his rhetoric to stoke fear of immigrants, claiming that the country was being “invaded” and amplifying rightwing lies about immigrant populations in places like Springfield, Ohio, where Haitians have become targets of threats and vitriol since the former president repeated a false rumor about the community. He has also echoed Adolf Hitler, saying that immigrants coming to the US were “poisoning the blood of our country”. He recently said record levels of migration under the Biden administration had turned the US into a “garbage can”. * * * Kamala Harris on foreign policy Global alliances: Harris’s approach to foreign policy has hewed closely to the president’s, with an emphasis on maintaining the US’s global alliances, especially Nato. Russia-Ukraine war: She has fully aligned herself with the Biden administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, pledging unyielding support for the nation as it battles to repel Russian forces from its territory. Harris has repeatedly attacked Putin’s “brutality” and warned that Trump would force Ukraine to “surrender” to Russia. Middle East crisis: In the Middle East, Harris again has been broadly supportive of the administration’s approach to Israel’s widening war, which began in Gaza and now includes Lebanon, Yemen and Iran. Like Biden, Harris has called for a ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Harris has repeatedly said the US will always support Israel’s right to defend itself, and has rebuffed activist calls to support an arms embargo on the country. However, she has been more vocally critical of Israel’s conduct during the yearlong conflict that has killed 43,000 Palestinians and deeply divided her party. She supports a two-state solution, with an independent Palestinian state. China: She has signaled a continuation of Biden’s tough-on-China approach and has said she would honor the US’s commitments to Taiwan. Donald Trump on foreign policy Trump, who shares isolationist impulses, has repeatedly said that the world was a more peaceful place when he was in power. Global alliances: He has long been a skeptic of global alliances. Nato continues to be a top target of his disdain – he once said he would “encourage” Russia to invade a member country if it wasn’t paying enough. He has not ruled out withdrawing from Nato, and even suggested he might step back from other alliances. Russia-Ukraine war: With many of his supporters opposed to continuing the flow of US aid to Ukraine, Trump has vowed to “fundamentally re-evaluate” the country’s approach. He has claimed that he will end the nearly three-year war on his first day in office, but offered no details on how he might accomplish this. During the presidential debate, he refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war. His flattery of Vladimir Putin and complicated history with Ukraine – he was impeached in 2019 for withholding aid as a means of pressuring his president for “dirt” on Biden – suggest the proposal would probably entail Ukraine giving up some of its territory captured by Russia. Middle East crisis: Trump has long cast himself as a champion of Israel, despite a long history of antisemitic remarks. Though he says he supports Israel’s mission, he has been critical of its tactics and has tangled with its leader, the rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. At home, he has advocated for an aggressive response to pro-Palestinian protests, suggesting he would strip foreign students of their visas if they express antisemitic or anti-American sentiment. China: In a second term, Trump has said he would take an even stronger stand against China, though he has praised its president, Xi Jinping, and has not said whether he would send troops if China invaded Taiwan. * * * Kamala Harris on climate and energy policies Harris has said unequivocally that the climate crisis is caused by human activity and represents an existential threat to the nation and the planet. Climate programs: As vice-president, Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Biden-Harris administration’s signature Inflation Reduction Act legislation that marked the country’s most significant effort yet to combat the climate crisis. The law made major investments in renewable energy as part of the administration’s overall aim to dramatically reduce the US’s planet-heating emissions by the end of the decade. But it also expanded planet-heating fossil fuels – something Harris touted in her September debate with Trump – and under Biden, Harris also presided over record-high US oil and gas production. Harris has walked back her support for the progressive Green New Deal proposal and a fracking ban. She is a proponent of electric vehicles – though does not support a mandate – and backs clean-energy tax credits, and has promoted climate justice programs, focused on protecting “frontline” communities from the impacts of the climate crisis. Donald Trump on climate and energy policies Trump has questioned established climate science, previously dismissing the climate crisis as “mythical” and an “expensive hoax”. He has also said that the warming climate is not necessarily responsible for making extreme weather events worse. On the campaign trail, he has summed up his position with the declaration: “Drill, baby, drill.” Environmental regulations: As president, Trump claims he will prioritize clean air and water for Americans. Yet he has also promised to continue to roll back environmental regulations, including all of the ones put in place by the Biden administration. Oil and gas: In a May meeting with oil bosses, he reportedly offered to dismantle Biden’s environmental rules and requested $1bn in contributions to his presidential campaign. During his first term, he dismantled many environmental policies, including protections for clean air and water as well as regulations aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions. He is especially opposed to wind power – falsely claiming wind turbines are a major threat to birds, cause cancer and “drive the whales crazy”.

"abortion"," France makes abortion a constitutional right in historic Versailles vote","The French parliament has enshrined abortion as a constitutional right at a historic joint session at the Palace of Versailles. Out of 925 MPs and senators eligible to vote, 780 supported the amendment, which will give women the “guaranteed freedom” to choose an abortion. There was thunderous applause in the chamber as the result was announced on Monday; in central Paris, the Eiffel Tower was illuminated to mark the occasion. The measure had already been passed by the upper and lower houses, the Sénat and the Assemblée Nationale, but final approval by parliamentarians at the joint session at Versailles was needed to effect constitutional change. The prime minister, Gabriel Attal, told those gathered in the opulent Congress Hall in the palace’s Midi wing: “We are haunted by the suffering and memory of so many women who were not free. We owe a moral debt [to all the women who] suffered in their flesh. “Today, the present must respond to history. To enshrine this right in our constitution is to close the door on the tragedy of the past and its trail of suffering and pain. It will further prevent reactionaries from attacking women. “Let’s not forget that the train of oppression can happen again. Let’s act to ensure that it doesn’t, that it never comes this day.” He added: “I say to all women within our borders and beyond, that today, the era of a world of hope begins.” Mathilde Panot, an MP from the hard-left France Unbowed, who proposed inscribing the abortion rights in the constitution, told the meeting it was “a promise … for all women fighting [for them] everywhere in the world”. She added: “Your fight is ours. This victory is yours.” The president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had promised to make women’s freedom to choose an abortion “irreversible”. Writing the right to abortion into the constitution, which involved amending the 17th paragraph of article 34 that defines the law and its limits, was seen as a way of protecting the law that decriminalised abortion in France in 1975. During the national assembly debate on the law in January, the justice minister, Éric Dupond-Moretti, told MPs that abortion rights were not simply a liberty like any other, “because they allow women to decide their future”. Aurore Bergé, the minister in charge of equality and the fight against discrimination, added: “This vote will be one of the most important and remarkable of this parliament.” Once the two houses had agreed the wording of the legal text, Macron had the choice to hold a national referendum or call a joint parliamentary “congress” made up of 577 MPs and 348 senators at Versailles where it required three-fifths of votes cast to pass. Monday’s session is the first to be held to change the constitution since 2008, when Nicolas Sarkozy took steps to modernise French institutions, including limiting presidents to a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms in office. Since 1958, the parliamentary congress has met 16 times and made 21 changes to the constitution. The congress was overseen by Yaël Braun-Pivet, from Macron’s Renaissance party, who is the equivalent of speaker of the lower house, and parliamentarians were seated in alphabetical order. The leaders of 18 political groups – 10 from the lower house, eight from the upper – were invited to each speak for five minutes on the change before the vote. The text will now be authenticated by a “seal of congress” and sent to the government. Macron will attend a ceremony to finalise the constitutional amendment on Friday, International Women’s Day. Political impetus was given to the constitutional change after the US supreme court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade, a ruling that had recognised women’s constitutional right to an abortion and had legalised it nationwide. Rightwing senators from the Républicains party voted against a first attempt to change the constitution in October 2022. Later that year, the French parliament voted to extend France’s legal limit for ending a pregnancy from 12 to 14 weeks, amid anger that thousands of women were forced to travel abroad each year to terminate pregnancies in countries including the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. Anti-abortion protesters gathered in Versailles near the palace to oppose the constitutional change. • The headline of this article was amended on 4 March 2024 to remove an incorrect reference that France is the first country in the world to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right.","2024-03-04T18:10:59Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/france-to-hold-final-vote-on-enshrining-abortion-as-a-constitutional-right"
"abortion","Packed Pacs: how billionaires in the US are bankrolling Republicans at the state level","Billionaires are increasingly bankrolling Republican candidates in state legislative races across the US to push a rightwing agenda and gain long-term hegemony. The concerted effort shows that Donald Trump ally Elon Musk, currently throwing his weight behind a candidate for Wisconsin’s state supreme court, is far from alone in seeking to build influence at the grassroots. According to a research document obtained by the Guardian, the contributions are not limited to federal elections but extend to state-level campaigns and aim to influence policy at the state level. Priorities include dismantling government, targeting “culture war” issues – particularly abortion – and advancing school privatisation. In Virginia, for example, donors Thomas Peterffy and Jeff Yass contributed significantly to Governor Glenn Youngkin’s political action committee (Pac) Spirit of Virginia. Peterffy gave $3m while Yass added $2m. Spirit of Virginia spent more than $8m supporting Republican candidates in the 2023 Virginia general assembly elections. Democratic state house leader Don Scott was quoted by the Axios website as saying that Republicans were relying on “nameless, faceless, out-of-state mega-donors who have been pouring millions into the Commonwealth to push right-wing policies with no regard to what Virginians actually want”. In Michigan, the DeVos family, including former education secretary Betsy DeVos, donated more than $4.4m to state Republican candidates and causes in 2024. More than $1m combined went to the Michigan house and senate Republican Pacs. The DeVos family is known for promoting “school-choice policies”, specifically the expansion of charter schools. The Bridge Michigan news site reported “no individual has shaped school policy as much as Betsy DeVos”, contributing to Michigan having “some of the nation’s highest concentrations of charter schools run by for-profit companies”. In Wisconsin, Diane Hendricks and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed a combined $7m to Republican legislative campaign committees in 2024. Hendricks has a long history of influencing Wisconsin politics, including pushing for “right-to-work” legislation. The Uihleins have backed efforts to make it harder to receive unemployment benefits, oppose Medicaid expansion and create barriers to voting. In Pennsylvania, Yass, who is the state’s wealthiest billionaire, funded Pacs that reportedly spent nearly $4.4m to unseat Pennsylvania house Democrats. Yass-affiliated Pacs supported candidates who sponsored a near-total abortion ban. Since the 2018 cycle, these Pacs gave “$370,000 to bill sponsors and cosponsors” of such legislation. Yass also prioritises spending public funds on private education and is Pennsylvania’s biggest “school choice” donor. He told Philadelphia Magazine last year that it would be a “good thing” if public schools “shut down”, adding: “There is no possible way a government monopoly could be a better approach to schools than market competition.” Republicans in Pennsylvania pushed a constitutional amendment to ban abortion in 2021 and 2022 but without success. In Arizona, Earl “Ken” Kendrick (owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team) and his family contributed more than $200,000 to Republican legislative candidates and Pacs during the 2024 cycle. The Kendrick family supported the retention of far-right, anti-choice judges on the state’s supreme court. Legislative Republicans referred a proposal to the ballot to attempt to make these positions lifetime appointments. State legislative chambers, once regarded as sleepy backwaters, have become partisan battlegrounds in recent years as they have a huge impact on issues ranging from book banks to transgender rights to voting laws. On an otherwise disastrous election night last November, Democrats held their own at state level, emerging with more legislative majorities than they managed in 2016 or 2020. In Pennsylvania, for example, they held off a red wave to defend a one-seat majority in the state house. But that appears to be spurring on a small group of super-rich donors aiming to reshape state-level politics with a focus on issues including abortion, education and labour rights. Critics say such contributions raise questions about the role of money in politics and the influence of billionaires on the democratic process. Bernie Sanders, an independent senator currently on a “Fighting Oligarchy Tour” across the country, told last year’s Democratic national convention in Chicago: “Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections. For the sake of our democracy we must overturn the disastrous Citizens United supreme court decision and move toward public funding of elections.”","2025-03-05T15:00:05Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/billionaires-funding-republicans"
"abortion","Trump news at a glance: Musk attacks president’s tax bill; Colorado suspect’s family detained by Ice","Days after officially exiting the White House, Elon Musk has grown increasingly critical of President Donald Trump’s signature tax bill, describing it as a “disgusting abomination”. Musk’s online outburst may embolden fiscally conservative Republican senators to defy Trump as they continue crucial negotiations on Capitol Hill over the so-called “one big, beautiful bill”. Musk departed the White House last week after steering its so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) with the stated mission of slashing fraud and abuse within federal departments.

"abortion","Arizona Republicans again block effort to repeal 1864 near-total abortion ban","After days of nationwide debate over the Arizona supreme court’s recent decision to uphold a near-total abortion ban from the 19th century, Arizona’s Republican-controlled statehouse has again quashed an effort to repeal the ban. Republicans, who hold a one-seat majority in both the Arizona house and senate, on Wednesday shot down a procedural measure in the statehouse that would have enabled the chamber to vote on a bill to repeal the ban. Just one Republican, the representative Matt Gress, voted with the house’s 29 Democrats, but the 30-30 split was not enough to move forward. Wednesday marked the second time that state legislators have tried to repeal the ban, which was first passed in 1864, since the state supreme court ruling. Last week, Gress tried to bring forth a vote on the repeal bill. However, he then voted with other Republicans to recess until Wednesday. The ban, passed before Arizona became a state, only permits abortions to save a woman’s life. It does not have exceptions for rape or incest. Due to legal delays, it is not yet in effect; instead, Arizona currently bans abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy. The GOP has long been opposed to abortion, but the US supreme court’s overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022 has complicated their stance. Anger over Roe’s fall was credited with slowing a much-promised “red wave” in the 2022 midterms, as well as helping abortion-rights supporters win a string of ballot measures in red and purple states. Now, before the 2024 elections, many Republicans are attempting to moderate their previously hardline views. After the Arizona supreme court’s decision last week, multiple Republicans with a history of anti-abortion beliefs denounced the ruling and the ban. Shawnna Bolick, a Republican state senator married to one of the justices who sided with the majority to uphold the 1864 ban, called on her colleagues to repeal it, as did Gress. Donald Trump, who appointed three of the US supreme court justices who overturned Roe and has said he believes each state should decide its own abortion laws, indicated that he believes the 1864 ban goes too far. Arizona’s ban, he suggested, will be “straightened out”. Hours after the scuttled effort in the state house, Anna Hernandez, a Democratic state senator, successfully introduced a senate version of the repeal bill, which senate Democrats will now seek to advance. Due to the senate’s procedural rules, passing that bill will take multiple days. Arizona abortion-rights supporters are continuing to gather signatures for a November ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.","2024-04-17T22:11:56Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/17/arizona-republicans-block-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Texas man seeks to have ex-partner investigated for out-of-state abortion","As soon as the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago, anti-abortion activists started debating if and how they could limit Americans’ ability to cross state lines for legal abortions. Now, a Texas man has asked a court to greenlight an investigation into the abortion his former partner allegedly received in a state where the procedure remains legal. The man, Collin Davis, said in court records that when he learned his former partner planned to get an abortion in February 2024, he hired an attorney who would “pursue wrongful-death claims against anyone involved in the killing of his unborn child”. According to the records, the woman proceeded to get an abortion in Colorado, a state that has become an abortion haven as laws banning the procedure have taken effect across much of the US midwest and south. Davis’s petition, filed in March and first reported by the Washington Post last week, seeks to use a Texas law that allows people to request legal depositions before potentially filing a lawsuit, in order to ascertain who may have “aided or abetted” the woman’s abortion. Davis argues that, if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing, he can sue under Texas’s wrongful-death statute or under a state law that permits private individuals to sue one another on suspicion of “aiding or abetting” an abortion past six weeks of pregnancy. Davis does not intend to sue the woman who got the alleged abortion, but is evaluating whether to go after “co-conspirators and accomplices” – a seemingly broad range of people that could include “any individual … involved in the murder of Mr Davis’ unborn child”. It is legal for people to cross state lines for abortions in states that still permit the procedure. However, activists determined to end abortion nationwide have launched a series of legislative and legal volleys to undermine that right, often by targeting groups and individuals who may help patients travel. Idaho has passed a law banning people from helping minors leave the state for legal abortions – an act that the state has labeled “abortion trafficking” – unless they have parental consent. Small Texas localities have passed a series of ordinances to restrict people’s ability to transport others along local roads for out-of-state abortions. Alabama’s attorney general has threatened to prosecute groups that help women leave the state for abortions – a threat that a federal judge beat back forcefully earlier this week. “Alabama can no more restrict people from going to, say, California to engage in what is lawful there than California can restrict people from coming to Alabama to do what is lawful here,” US district judge Myron Thompson wrote in a preliminary ruling in a lawsuit brought by Alabama abortion providers and their supporters. Davis is being represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a prominent anti-abortion attorney and architect of the Texas law that permits people to sue over suspected illegal abortions. Mitchell, who is also representing another Texas man who is currently suing his ex-wife’s friends for allegedly helping her get an abortion, believes current law allows for holding people liable for helping procure out-of-state abortions. “Fathers of aborted fetuses can sue for wrongful death in states with abortion bans, even if the abortion occurs out-of-state,” Mitchell said in a statement. “They can sue anyone who paid for the abortion, anyone who aided or abetted the travel, and anyone involved in the manufacture or distribution of abortion drugs.” Molly Duane, a senior staff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the woman, said abortion foes want to use Davis’s filing to sow confusion and terror. “It has never been the case that a state can prohibit its citizens from leaving the state. That would be absurd,” Duane said. “This is a coordinated fear campaign. If they can’t prohibit them from traveling, well, then they want to scare them, and make them think that they’re doing something wrong.” Since Roe fell, several states, including Colorado, have enacted so-called “shield laws” to generally protect people from being investigated or prosecuted by states that ban abortion. It is not yet clear what role, if any, Colorado’s shield law may play in Davis’s case. Court records in Davis’s case also repeatedly cite the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that, in the eyes of some abortion opponents, bans the mailing of abortion-related materials nationwide. Such an interpretation of the Comstock Act, which the Biden administration disagrees with, would result in a de facto national ban on abortions, because clinics rely on the mail to obtain the drugs and equipment they need to do their jobs. Davis is waiting for a ruling from the state district court, which the Center for Reproductive Rights may in turn appeal. If the case proceeds, Mitchell wants to depose the woman who had the alleged abortion and others connected to it, with questioning about “all sources of financial support for the abortion”, and to obtain records of any communications with abortion providers and funds. Mitchell has previously asked Texas abortion funds for information about recent abortions that they have “assisted or facilitated in any way”. Although Duane is steadfast in her belief that Texas law does not prohibit people from helping one another leave the state for abortions, she still fears for the future. “Nothing is safe. No one is safe,” she said. “I cannot guarantee anyone, really, that they won’t be pursued for harassing or frivolous legal actions.”","2024-05-11T14:00:29Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/11/texas-man-ex-out-of-state-abortion"
"abortion","Missouri governor calls special session to redraw congressional maps to aid Republicans","The Missouri governor, Mike Kehoe, has moved to help the Republican party gain an additional seat in Congress, calling a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state. Kehoe’s announcement on Friday followed a pressure campaign from Donald Trump, who has urged Republican states to reshape district boundaries to more heavily favor Republicans, boosting the party’s chances of maintaining control of the House of Representatives in 2026. The announcement came hours after Texas governor Greg Abbott ratified a new congressional voting map that is designed to help Republicans gain five more congressional seats in next year’s elections. Trump has also pushed Indiana lawmakers to redraw that state’s maps, and has pushed lawmakers in Florida and Ohio to help net three or more seats for the Republican party. The president celebrated Kehoe’s announcement on social media, and urged Missouri lawmakers to pass “a new, much fairer, and much improved, congressional map, that will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional Maga Republican in the 2026 midterm elections”. In response, Democratic-led states sought to fight back by redrawing their district maps as well, but the party controls fewer state legislatures. California’s governor Gavin Newsom has signed two redistricting bills to counter Texas’s move, which will have to be approved by voters on 4 November. Following the approval of Texas’s new congressional maps, the Democratic Governors Association released the following statement: “Republicans can’t defend their toxic and unpopular agenda of gutting healthcare for millions of Americans, so they’re trying to rig our elections before a single vote has even been cast. “Democratic governors are on the frontlines of this fight – and they will use every tool available to stand up for their states and ensure fair representation.” It is highly unusual for states to redistrict in the middle of a decade; they normally adjust their districting following the decennial census, to reflect population changes. Kehoe also said the special legislative session would focus on initiative petition reform, which would render citizen-led initiative petitions – such as those overturning Missouri’s abortion ban and enacting a minimum wage increase and paid sick days – harder to enact. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democratic representative from Missouri whose district could be carved up when maps are redrawn, said that in remaking the state’s congressional maps, “lawmakers would be working to drown out Missouri voices in favor of a single man a thousand miles away”. “But let us be clear: should this effort move forward, we will not concede,” he added. “I will not surrender the voices of the people who entrusted me to fight for them.”","2025-08-29T23:09:34Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/missouri-governor-special-legislative-session-congressional-maps"
"abortion","California readies itself as ‘abortion sanctuary’ while Arizona gears up for ban","As Arizona prepares for a near-total ban on abortion to go into effect in the coming months, providers in California are getting ready to welcome a surge of out-of-state clients and live up to the state’s reputation as an “abortion sanctuary”. California clinics have been treating patients confused by the legal framework in neighboring Arizona ever since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 law enshrining a federal right to abortion, in June 2022. Arizona has had a near-total abortion ban on its books since 1864, but that law hadn’t been enforced since the Roe decision in 1973. After the supreme court’s ruling to overturn Roe, the Arizona supreme court allowed enforcement of the 1864 ban to go back into effect. At the same time, however, Republican lawmakers in the statehouse passed a newer law banning abortions after 15 weeks. After Roe was overturned, “there was a lot of confusion both on the part of patients and providers in terms of what they could and could not do to be adhering to the law,” said Pratima Gupta, an OB-GYN who provides abortion care in San Diego and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. She remembers clinics closing their doors, just to be told that the 1864 total ban wouldn’t be enforced after all. The need was urgent, Gupta recalled. She particularly remembered one patient who had driven hours by herself from Arizona for an abortion. After the procedure, “she literally jumped off the table, started to get dressed and asked: ‘Can I go home now?’ Because she had arranged childcare for a certain amount of time.” Gupta and her colleagues begged her to stay just 10 minutes so they could observe her before she drove the four hours home. “That is the level of motivation that we are seeing,” she said. California law guaranteed abortion rights before Roe and voters further enshrined those rights in the state constitution in November 2022. When Roe was overturned, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a package of 12 laws protecting and expanding abortion access in the state and directed $200m in state funding to supporting out-of-state patients, including $20m to help those patients pay for travel, lodging and other logistical expenses. Clinics across California saw a surge in out-of-state patients. Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest (PPPSW), for example, which operates 20 clinics across the California border in San Diego, Los Angeles and Imperial county, said roughly 10% of all abortion patients at its clinics today come from states outside California. Today, California providers are preparing for another surge in Arizona patients. On 9 April, the Arizona supreme court ruled that the 1864 total abortion ban – which had wound its way through the local courts – could take effect. The ban will become enforceable this June – meaning abortion is still legal in Arizona before 15 weeks until then. Kris Mayes, Arizona’s attorney general, has said her office will not prosecute patients or physicians who provide abortions, and Democratic lawmakers in the state have vowed to try to repeal the ban (including by introducing an amendment that voters will get to consider this November guaranteeing the right to abortion care in the state constitution). Still, providers expect the legal limbo will move many people seeking abortions to seek care elsewhere. “This ruling places patients in Arizona in an even more precarious position,” said Darrah DiGiorgio Johnson, president and CEO of PPPSW. The organization announced that it has appointments available for Arizona patients “in days not weeks”. Organizations such Access Reproductive Justice, a California-based abortion fund, are offering to connect people seeking abortions and other reproductive healthcare with providers in the state, and provide logistical and financial support. Still, there are challenges. Many patients needing care struggle to make the journey out of state, said Gupta, especially youth, members of the LGBTQ+ community and undocumented patients. Currently, the majority of southern California’s abortion clinics are located in the San Diego and Los Angeles metro areas. Those are crucial, and convenient for patients to fly in to from out of state. But there are far fewer providers in rural areas, including near the California-Arizona border, and a growing number of hospitals in those regions have made significant cuts in maternal and reproductive healthcare. Planned Parenthood does operate one clinic in El Centro, just an hour’s drive from the Arizona border. That clinic burned down in August 2023. The organization opened a temporary facility to continue seeing patients there and is scheduled to open a new permanent health center this summer, said Sandra Duran, communications director of PPPSW. Before it caught fire, up to half of the patients seeking care at the El Centro clinic came from out of state or Mexico. Although she’s hopeful that advanced practice clinicians will be able to expand access to abortion care in rural California, Gupta notes that the continued closure of obstetrics units in rural hospitals across the state is worrisome. It means that backup can be increasingly far away for those providers. The 2022 bills have provided some relief, she said, in particular a law that allowed nurse practitioners and nurse midwives to perform first-trimester aspiration abortions without a doctor present. “That’s been tremendously helpful, especially in expanding care to our more rural communities in California,” said Gupta. She adds that although California “is welcoming trainees from other states”, it’s difficult to convince new providers to move to California because it’s one of the most expensive states to live in. Researchers are also examining whether allowing California pharmacists to prescribe abortion pills to out-of-state patients would be another way to expand care. Pharmacists in California and in many other states can prescribe contraception, but prescribing abortion medication is out of their scope, explained Cathren Cohen, a staff attorney at the UCLA Law Center on Reproductive Health, Law and Policy and the author of a recent paper on the topic. She and her colleagues found that 69% of California pharmacists would be willing to prescribe abortion pills if they were allowed to. Researchers are still studying how effective a legislative change making that happen would be – and whether such laws could be implemented will depend on a supreme court ruling expected this summer that could limit access to medication abortion.","2024-04-19T12:00:02Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/19/california-abortion-sanctuary-arizona-ban"
"abortion","These Tennessee lawmakers love the unborn. After birth? Not so much","Think of the children? Nah You’ve probably seen this quote from an Alabama pastor called Dave Barnhart. It goes viral all the time. But I’m resurfacing the quote because it is another day that ends with “y” in America, which means it is relevant once again. “The unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for,” Barnhart said back in 2018, remarking wryly on the movement’s priorities. “They never make demands of you … They don’t need money, education or childcare … They allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn.” Over in Tennessee, there are a lot of lawmakers who are very proud of how much they advocate for unborn children. In 2022, as soon as Roe was overturned, the state passed one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans – one without explicit exceptions to save the life of a pregnant person. The ban also made performing or attempting to perform an abortion a class C felony – akin to aggravated assault – which means aiding in an abortion can land you prison time and a hefty fine. That ban has been continuously challenged in court but the bottom line is that getting an abortion in Tennessee is almost impossible. Those Tennessee lawmakers who love unborn children? Surprise, surprise, they’re not so keen on the born ones. Particularly if those kids are immigrants. On Thursday, the GOP-dominated state senate approved a bill that lets public schools check the citizenship or legal immigration status of every student. Undocumented children can be denied enrollment at these public schools or forced to pay tuition. In other words: Tennessee wants to make it legal to deny undocumented kids an education. By requiring school systems to check legal immigrant status, they’re also turning what should be safe spaces into immigration enforcement centers. All of which, to be clear, is blatantly unconstitutional. In 1982, the supreme court decision in Plyler v Doe found states cannot deny students a free public education over their immigration status. The Tennessee bill is not law yet, and if the Tennessee governor does sign it, it will almost certainly face legal challenges. But even if it eventually gets struck down, there is a chance it will stay on the books as a “zombie law” – ready to rise again when circumstances allow. Perhaps you are wondering why all these fierce advocates for the rights of unborn children are so keen on denying kids an education? According to lawmakers who voted for the measure, it’s not because they’re hateful racists who want to punish kids, it’s because they are being fiscally responsible. Their argument is that the state simply doesn’t have enough money for education for undocumented kids, particularly since some will require English language learner classes. There’s a small possibility – just throwing it out there – that one of the reasons Tennessee is finding it hard to find money for education is because its regressive tax policies are heavily weighted towards extracting money from the poor rather than making the rich pay their fair share. Tennessee is one of the nine states in the US that doesn’t have an income tax. It also doesn’t have inheritance tax and has very low business tax. Residents (including undocumented immigrants) pay sales tax, property tax and a grocery tax. Undocumented immigrants are putting money into the system and getting very little out of it. Pretending that this attack on undocumented children is about money is disingenuous. Deep down, I’m sure even the people voting for the bill know that investing in children pays dividends to society. Still, while it is disheartening that a bill like this got as far as it did, it’s also important to note that it faced a lot of opposition. Nearly half of the senate’s members spoke on the bill – many of them, including some Republicans, in passionate disagreement. There were tears and a lot of Bible verses quoted about compassion for children. As the US becomes increasingly dystopian, it’s important that we don’t lose sight of just how much opposition there is to the extremist policies and legislation a hate-filled minority are pushing through. Donald Trump likes to say that winning the popular vote gave him and his cronies a mandate to do whatever they like; that all the policies getting passed have the support of the people. This simply isn’t true. Only around 32% of eligible voters actually voted for Trump. While we must not minimize the amount of misogyny and racism there is in the US (and there is a lot!), we should also take heart from the fact that a sizable number of Americans do not want to live in an authoritarian dystopia where women have no rights and undocumented kids get no education. Sixty-three percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases according to Pew research from 2024. Most Americans say undocumented immigrants should have a way to stay in the country legally if certain requirements are met. Increasingly, the actions of the American government don’t reflect the views of the American people. Which, of course, is why the Trump administration is so obsessed with undermining education as a whole. From trying to stop undocumented immigrants from going to school, to tightly controlling how Ivy League universities operate, to attempting to eliminate the US Department of Education, Republicans are waging a war on critical thinking. The US just made it harder for married women to vote On Thursday the US House approved the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which requires people to prove they are citizens when they vote. If you changed your birth name – as around 80% of women in opposite-sex marriages in the US have – you will have to show a lot more paperwork to vote. Mickey Rourke tells JoJo Siwa he will tie her up and make her straight I had to look up who Rourke is because he hasn’t been relevant for a while. Now, however, he is making headlines for being misogynistic and homophobic on Celebrity Big Brother UK. Rourke, 72, recently told JoJo Siwa (a gay singer and social media personality) that he’d turn her straight. “If I stay [in the Big Brother house] longer than four days, you won’t be gay any more,” Rourke said to Siwa in a clip from Wednesday. “I’ll tie you up,” he added. Rourke got a warning from producers for his language but his comments were not censored. This is in stark contrast to a Big Brother “controversy” last year, when ITV, the broadcaster, edited an episode of the show to remove shots of a T-shirt worn by one of the contestants featuring a watermelon, which is a symbol of Palestinian solidarity.

"abortion","Clashing convictions mark protests as US supreme court weighs abortion pill","Supporters and opponents of abortion rights gathered on the steps of the supreme court on Tuesday, where, just beyond the marbled columns, the justices were hearing oral arguments in the most consequential abortion-related case since it overturned Roe v Wade nearly two years ago. At stake is the accessibility of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the country. In clashing speeches, advocates shared their abortion stories, with one speaker describing how the experience drove her to shun the procedure and another sharing how the decision to terminate her pregnancy allowed her to leave an abusive relationship and pursue a career in medicine. “This is something I shouldn’t have to reveal to strangers or to politicians for my choice to be respected,” Brittany House, a patient advocate with Planned Parenthood, told the hundreds of pro-choice supporters. “An abortion,” House continued, “is supposed to be between a patient and their provider.” Yards away, a group of abortion opponents lay on the ground with red balloons that said “abortion kills”. A pregnant woman had scrawled “fully human” on her bare belly. “We’d like to see the FDA really step up and bring back some of those commonsense protections for women,” said Felipe Avila of the National Association of Pro-Life Nurses, repeating the disputed claim at the heart of the case that the FDA-approved pill is dangerous. Self-managed abortions have soaredsince the supreme court eliminated federal protection for abortion in June 2022, paving the way for nearly two dozen states to restrict or ban access to the procedure. Decades of research have concluded that a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is a safe and effective method for terminating a pregnancy in the first trimester. “It allows them to access medication abortion in the comfort and privacy of their own home,” said Divya Shenoy, a family medicine physician and the director of primary care at the Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington. “Not being able to have this option would be really, really challenging for a lot of patients who are trying to seek abortion care.” Inside the courtroom, a majority of the justices appeared skeptical of the arguments in favor of restricting access to mifepristone put forth by a group of anti-abortion doctors. Outside, pop music blared as activists squared off in testy exchanges that did little to win converts on one of the most deeply held convictions in American life. One young anti-abortion activist carried a bound version of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, an 887-page conservative-policy blueprint for a Trump second term that instructs the next president to work with Congress “to enact the most robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support”. A pro-choice activist came dressed as Anthony Comstock, the 19th-century anti-vice crusader behind the eponymous Comstock Act. Some conservatives and Trump allies see enforcement of the 1873 law, which barred the mailing of “lewd” materials including drugs that could be used to terminate a pregnancy, as a possible path to banning abortion nationwide without Congress. The activist, wearing mutton chops and a top hat and speaking as Comstock, said: “I am back as a representative of the century they want to bring us back to.” A group of abortion-rights protesters was part of a planned act of civil disobedience intended to highlight the gravity of the case that could once again dramatically reshape the legal landscape, including in states that protect abortion. About 14 people were arrested, according to the groups involved. The case, which could be decided in June, may also have profound implications in the race for the White House. Even as conservative lawmakers roll back abortion access, voters have repeatedly chosen to protect it at the ballot box, even in deep red states. Julie von Haefen, a Democratic state lawmaker from battleground North Carolina who attended the rally at the supreme court, said abortion would be a defining issue of the 2024 election, especially in suburban areas like the one she represents. “After Trump, suburban women rose up and said: ‘We don’t want this, we don’t want any more bans, we want to be able to control her healthcare decisions,’” Von Haefen said in an interview. “It’s definitely something that people talk a lot about in areas like mine.” In a nod to how important advocates believe the issue will be this election, activists carried mock-campaign signs that said “Mife &amp; Miso 2024”. Moments before oral arguments began, Mira Michels of Aid Access, an organization that mails abortion pills to people across the US, swallowed a mifepristone pill dispensed to her by a roving “Roe-bot”. After a swig of water, she declared: “Tastes like freedom.” The robots are operated remotely from states with so-called shield laws, which protect clinicians who serve patients in states where providing abortion is illegal. In practice, a patient would have a telehealth appointment with a provider, and the machine would then dispense the pill. Rebecca Gomperts, the Dutch physician who founded Aid Access, said the machines were intended “to show that we’re not living in the Middle Ages. We live in the 21st century and we’re not going back.” No matter how the justices rules, Gomperts said her group would continue to find ways to help American women access medication abortion. “This case is not about taking this off the market yet,” she said. “So it will continue to be available and our providers are going to continue to ship it to women in all 50 states.”","2024-03-26T21:44:54Z","https://www.theguardian.com/law/2024/mar/26/protesters-clash-supreme-court-abortion-pill-case"
"abortion","US supreme court seems skeptical of arguments against abortion drug mifepristone","The supreme court on Tuesday seemed skeptical of arguments made by anti-abortion doctors asking it to roll back the availability of mifepristone, a drug typically used in US medication abortion. The arguments were part of the first major abortion case to reach the justices since a 6-3 majority ruled in 2022 to overturn Roe v Wade and end the national right to abortion. The rightwing groups that brought the case argued that the justices should roll back measures taken since 2016 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the drug’s availability. A decision in the anti-abortion doctors’ favor would apply nationwide, including in states that protect abortion access, and would probably make the drug more difficult to acquire. Medication abortion now accounts for almost two-thirds of abortions performed in the US. Much of Tuesday’s arguments focused on whether the anti-abortion doctors who sued the FDA, a coalition known as the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, have standing, or the right to bring the case in the first place. The doctors claim they will suffer harm if they have to treat women who experience complications from mifepristone, an argument the Biden administration, which appealed the case to the court, has rejected as too speculative. The US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the FDA, argued that the doctors do not come within “100 miles” of having the legal right to bring the case, arguing that their case rests on a “long chain of remote contingencies”. Under their argument, Prelogar said, a woman would have to face complications from a medication abortion that were so serious that she needed emergency care at a hospital – an unlikely scenario, given mifepristone’s proven safety record – and then end up in the care of an anti-abortion doctor who was somehow forced into taking care of her in such a way it violated the doctor’s conscience. A number of the justices – even the ones who ruled to overturn Roe two years ago – seemed skeptical that the doctors met the threshold required to establish standing. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh seemed to seek assurances that the doctors represented by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine were already covered by laws that protect doctors from having to undertake cases that violated their consciences. Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed to express concern over the sweeping implications of the doctors’ request of the court. “This case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government rule,” he said. The supreme court has historically rejected standing arguments based on such potential harm. However, Justice Clarence Thomas raised the possibility that perhaps the court’s own threshold for standing was too strict. His fellow conservative Samuel Alito also seemed incredulous of Prelogar’s argument. “Is there anybody who can sue and get a judicial ruling on whether what FDA did was lawful?” he asked. “Shouldn’t somebody be able to challenge that in court?” Since the fall of Roe in June 2022, more than a dozen states have banned abortion. The result has been legal and medical chaos. Dozens of women have come forward to say that they were denied medically necessary abortions. Abortion clinics in states that still allow abortion are overwhelmed by the flood of patients fleeing states with bans. More than 1m abortions were performed in the US in 2023, a record high. The availability of medication abortions, which are usually performed using mifepristone as well as another drug called misoprostol, has helped soften the impact of the bans. Telehealth medication abortions, permitted by the FDA since the pandemic, helped ease some of the burden on abortion clinics; shield laws, passed in a handful of states, even allowed providers to offer telehealth abortions to people living in states with abortion bans. But the accessibility of medication abortion also made it the next target of the anti-abortion movement after Roe was overturned. In 2022 the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine challenged the FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone. The group, which includes anti-abortion doctors and is being defended by the Christian powerhouse legal firm the Alliance Defending Freedom, argued that the FDA overstepped its authority and that mifepristone is unsafe. (More than 100 studies have concluded that mifepristone can be safely used to terminate a pregnancy.) A federal judge ruled in favor of the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a move that could have yanked mifepristone off the market entirely. But an appeals court narrowed that ruling, deciding that it was too late to challenge mifepristone’s original 2000 approval. Instead, the appeals court ruled to rewind later measures taken by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including by removing requirements that abortion providers dispense mifepristone in person. A recent analysis found 16% of all US abortions are facilitated through telehealth. Mifepristone’s availability has remained unchanged as litigation has progressed. During oral arguments, Thomas and Alito also raised the specter of the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that bans the mailing of abortion-related materials. Long regarded as a relic, the Comstock Act has now seen a resurgence of post-Roe support among anti-abortion activists who believe it is the key to a de facto nationwide abortion ban. “How do you respond to an argument that mailing your product and advertising it would violate the Comstock Act?” Thomas asked Jessica Ellsworth, a lawyer for Danco Laboratories, a manufacturer of mifepristone. After some back and forth, Ellsworth told Thomas: “That statute has not been forced for nearly 100 years and I don’t believe that this case presents an opportunity for the court to opine on the reach of the statute.” Regardless of what the supreme court decides, Americans will still be able to order mifepristone online from suppliers who help people “self-manage” their own abortions. A study released on Monday found self-managed abortions had soared since Roe fell. Outrage over the overturning of Roe has turned abortion into a key election issue, since most Americans support at least some degree of abortion access. Voters in multiple states, including conservative strongholds, have voted in ballot initiatives in favor of abortion rights; roughly a dozen states are now expected to put abortion-related ballot measures to voters come November. Democrats are hoping that the issue will bolster turnout for their candidates, including Joe Biden. The supreme court is expected to issue a ruling in the mifepristone case by the summer, just months ahead of the 2024 elections. The case’s consequences could stretch far beyond abortion. If the justices greenlight attempts by ideologically driven groups to second-guess the authority of the FDA, the agency’s regulation of all manner of drugs – such as contraception and vaccines – could be challenged in court. Ellsworth, the Danco attorney, argued that the doctors’ argument in the case “is so inflexible it would upend not just mifepristone, but virtually every drug approval”.","2024-03-26T20:23:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/26/us-supreme-court-abortion-pill-case-mifepristone"
"abortion","Ministers speaking out against assisted dying ‘are giving false impression’, says peer","Senior ministers who have spoken out against assisted dying are giving voters a “false impression” about the government’s position, a leading proponent of changing the law has said. Charlie Falconer, a Labour peer and former justice secretary, said opponents to the change were “getting more coverage” because ministers in favour of legalising assisted dying were “playing by the rules”. MPs are preparing to vote on a bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales later this week. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, told a constituent she was “profoundly concerned” the bill would initiate a “slippery slope towards death on demand” and that “the state should never offer death as a service”. Mahmood’s letter, which was published on social media over the weekend and reported by the Observer, warned the bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales lacked appropriate safeguards. Mahmood, who is Britain’s most senior Muslim politician, wrote that while she believed in the sanctity of life and that was the starting point for her position, she was opposed to the bill for legal and political reasons. Her intervention has triggered questions about how a change in the law would be implemented with the health secretary and the justice secretary opposed to it. Wes Streeting has argued it could lead to coercion and ordered his department to carry out a review of its potential costs. Lord Falconer, an ally of Keir Starmer who served in his shadow cabinet until 2021, told the Guardian that the arguments from Mahmood and Streeting were giving the “false impression that their departments are against it”. “The awfulness of them breaking the rules is that it gives the impression that their departments are against it when they most certainly are not,” he said. Asked about the absence of a vocal proponent for the change within the government, Falconer said: “Nobody in the government can do it, because all the people in favour are playing by the rules. The rule-breakers are getting more coverage because they’re breaking the rules so spectacularly. And so they’re getting a platform.” Falconer added that ministers’ religious views should not “determine the choices that people have in their death”. “Generally, the people who are opposed to it are opposed to it on spiritual grounds … There’s nothing wrong with religion – but that obviously colours their view and is not an objective stance on things like safeguards.” Three former directors of public prosecutions have backed the bill, which Falconer said was evidence that it was an improvement on the current law. Starmer, himself a former director of public prosecutions, has declined to state his position but voted in favour of assisted dying in 2015. “Keir is playing by the rules – rightly so,” Falconer said. “It would be incredibly interesting to hear his views as the ex-DPP, particularly to counter the views of Shabana.” Downing Street sources said neither the prime minister nor Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, planned to set out their views before the vote on Friday. Proponents of the bill, which was put forward by Kim Leadbeater, a Labour backbencher, say they are confident they have the numbers for it to pass its first parliamentary hurdle. Opponents say a number of MPs are planning to vote in favour of the bill in the first instance without necessarily supporting it, on the assumption there will be meaningful scrutiny and chances to amend it in later stages. Labour MPs who are not attached to either camp say that although proponents of the change have been better organised than its opponents, many MPs harbour reservations about it privately. The fact that MPs have a free vote and that Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats are all divided on the issue make the result difficult to predict. Leadbeater told Sky News she welcomed “robust debate” and that she did not have “any doubts whatsoever” about the bill. Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary who is in favour of the change, told the BBC that “it is really important as a society we talk about what makes for a good death”. The justice minister Heidi Alexander and health ministers Karin Smyth and Stephen Kinnock are also among those who support legalising assisted dying. A source close to Streeting said: “Wes has approached this issue in a genuine, thoughtful and considerate way, setting out his own view while respecting others’ views. He has always played the ball, not the man.”","2024-11-24T18:00:18Z","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/ministers-speaking-out-against-assisted-dying-false-impression-charlie-falconer"
"abortion","Abigail Spanberger presents herself as bulwark against chaos and cruelty","She spoke of political turmoil coming out of Washington. Recklessness and heartlessness coming out of Washington. A careless, chaotic, reckless economic policy coming out of Washington. She did not mention Donald Trump. The Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, pitched her closing argument on Saturday to more than 7,000 supporters at a campaign rally in Norfolk, home to the world’s biggest naval base. To the joy of the crowd she was joined on stage by former president Barack Obama, who eviscerated the Trump presidency with barbs, sarcasm and biting critiques. Spanberger, by contrast, is betting that the antidote to Trumpism is unflashy competence and a focus on the cost of living. The former CIA officer and three-term congresswoman has not attended any of the No Kings protests that featured millions of anti-Trump voters and seldom mentions him by name. “I feel like if I say it too much, it’s like Beetlejuice,” the 46-year-old joked recently to the Associated Press. “He’s gonna show up.” It is a different approach a year after Kamala Harris hammered a warning about stopping Trump to save democracy only for him to sweep back into power. On Tuesday Democrats hope to start hauling themselves up off the canvas by winning gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. History will be made in Virginia where Spanberger and the Republican lieutenant-governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, are vying to become the state’s first female governor. The commonwealth, as it is known, is also seeking to reassert its claim to be the most progressive state in the south after four years under Republican Glenn Youngkin. Virginia is second only to California in the size of its federal workforce. Spanberger has vowed in stump speeches to stand up for the thousands of employees laid off by Trump’s department of government efficiency, or Doge. “We need a governor who will support the thousands upon thousands of Virginia families whose livelihoods have been disrupted or destroyed because of Doge and now this government shutdown,” she said in Norfolk, against a backdrop of a giant Stars and Stripes and supporters waving mini-US flags and campaign signs. “We do not need someone who has said that losing a job isn’t a ‘real issue’ when we have Virginians who have dedicated themselves to service to our country who have lost their jobs because of bad policies and a reckless administration.” The “someone” in question was Earle-Sears, 61, who has been criticised for not taking the government shutdown seriously. The marine veteran has vowed to cut taxes, root out wasteful government spending and be tough on crime. A Jamaican-born immigrant, she has accused Democrats of playing “the race card”. Her campaign was boosted by an endorsement from Trump and a down-ticket scandal involving the Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, who reportedly sent violent text messages about a political rival in 2022. But polls show Earle-Sears trailing by about seven percentage points in a state that Obama won in 2008 – the first Democrat in 44 years to do so – and that Trump has lost three times. Indeed, Virginia had been moving left for years on issues such as reproductive rights, gun safety and the death penalty until Youngkin’s 2021 victory put a Republican back in the governor’s mansion. Earle-Sears has sought to emulate the Youngkin playbook with a focus on culture war issues such as abortion, parents’ rights and transgender athletes. She ran an ad that attacks Spanberger for voting “to let boys share locker rooms with little girls” and “let children change genders without telling their parents”. Echoing a spot from Trump’s campaign last year, a narrator says: “Spanberger is for they/them, not us.” But this time the messages appear to be falling flat. Brian Jones, a partner at Black Rock Group, told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington that Republicans “jumped right to where they thought they could replicate some of the success of President Trump on the trans issue. It’s my sense that it hasn’t broken through. I don’t know if people are tired of the message or it’s just not as effective. “My sense is that Winsome Sears has not been effective in driving a credible message on Spanberger, [who has] done a nice job on the bio front presenting herself as somebody who is this committed centrist.” Spanberger’s brand was reinforced on Saturday when Obama extolled her ability to reach across the aisle despite Washington’s deepening polarisation. He told the crowd: “Abigail is ranked as the most bipartisan member of Congress from the Commonwealth. She has had bills signed into law by both President Trump and President Biden. That is not easy to do.” As Democrats continue to debate how to fight back, Spanberger has not been drawing the huge crowds that follow progressive Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But those who did attend the rally in Norfolk took a pragmatic view of her candidacy in a purple state such as Virginia. Kacie Schappert, 46, a doctor’s assistant attending with her 14-year-old daughter, said: “Some things I agree with, some things I don’t but at this point regardless Democrats need to come together and fight the craziness that’s going on. We have to vote for the people that are most going to do that for us. She’s a woman; she’s in a state that can go either way; she has to be moderate.” The party that lost the White House is often the more energised in off-year elections and 2025 promises to be no different. A vendor outside the rally was selling merchandise with slogans such as “Anti Trump Grandmas Club”, “Are we great yet?”, “Cats against Trump”, “Elect a clown, expect a circus”, “Gulf of Mexico: est 1550”, “No Kings in America”, “No kings since 1776” and a silhouette of dog defecating on the word “Trump”. Standing in a queue outside the sports arena, June Ameika, 61, a pilates and yoga teacher whose husband served in the navy for 30 years, said: “What’s going on in our country at the moment is absolutely frightening and so it takes all of us to come out and show support and be visible. “Every election is about sending a message. We have to let Trump know that his behaviour is despicable, breaking the law is despicable, and we’re not going to stand for it. Donald Trump has basically no regard for the democracy of this country and that’s fundamental going forward.” Spanberger is currently embarked on her second statewide bus tour of the campaign. On Thursday, she spoke at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria, delivering her stump speech in both English and Spanish – a language she used to conduct arrests during her days as a federal agent working narcotics cases. She accused the Trump administration of terrorising communities with its hardline approach to immigration. “I am a law-and-order Democrat – I’m a former intel officer and a former federal agent – but it is not law and in order to have your citizens, your community members, live in fear,” she said. Some attenders were government workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began a month ago. Anna, 45, a Latino single mother who did not wish to give her last name, said: “I try to save, but it’s not going to last long. Instead of going out and contributing to the global economy, now it’s more restricted. I cannot spend a lot of money on certain things. It’s hard.” Anna said she would vote for Spanberger because of immigration, abortion and LGBTQ rights and urged Latino voters, who swung towards the Republicans last year, to return to the Democratic fold. “I hope people are opening their eyes. Latinos have to unify. I hope those who were in the middle and went towards Trump will now switch.” Spanberger presented herself as a bulwark against the chaos and cruelty emanating from Washington. She promised to work tirelessly to lower costs in housing, energy and healthcare and to improve public schools. She did not dwell on Trump and his attacks on institutions. Lauren Spears, 55, who works part-time at a school, said: “I love her background: CIA, law enforcement, congresswoman. I love that she is reasonable, moderate, very smart. She is a wonky policy kind of person and is good at compromise, which is what our government desperately needs.” Republicans have poured late money into the race but Trump has given only tepid support for Earle-Sears and has not campaigned with her in person – a clue that he suspects she cannot win. She has struggled to pull off the Trump-lite approach that Youngkin mastered four years ago by nodding to Maga without fully embracing it. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “The Republican candidate is a pleasant enough person but she’s far right. She is extreme. What worries me about Spanberger is she’s going to try and be bipartisan the way she’s advertising. She’s going to find the Democrats won’t put up with that either. This is not the time to be bipartisan.”","2025-11-02T17:01:03Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/abigail-spanberger-virginia-candidate-governor"
"abortion","The supreme court’s abortion pill ruling isn’t the end of a fight. It’s the beginning","On Thursday, the US supreme court unanimously ruled that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine – a sock-puppet group of fanatically anti-choice doctors and busybodies – lacked standing to sue in the group’s challenge to the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, the drug that is now used in more than 60% of American abortions. The court’s decision may seem like the end of this battle. It’s only the beginning. The lawsuit in question had originally emerged from Amarillo, Texas, in a federal court that has become a destination for anti-choice litigants because Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee and the sole judge hearing federal civil cases in the district, is a militant anti-abortion activist. Kacsmaryk made news when he used to case as a pretext to issue a nationwide injunction revoking FDA approval of the drug. The fifth circuit court, a radically rightwing appeals panel which has jurisdiction over Texas and which has repeatedly sought to push the supreme court to new heights of anti-abortion extremism, upheld most of Kacsmaryk’s ruling, but limited the case to challenges that the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 to make mifepristone more easily available. The case that reached the supreme court was about whether the drug, which has been found to be safer than Tylenol, could be used between seven and 10 weeks of pregnancy, and – crucially – whether it could be prescribed by telehealth and sent through the mail. There was only one problem: the plaintiffs had no legal standing whatsoever. Their merits case was bad enough – they relied on obscure, since-retracted studies to claim that mifepristone was dangerous. But their theory of how they were harmed by the drug’s availability – even though they neither took nor prescribed it – was fanciful, heavily contingent and ultimately too far-fetched even for this very enthusiastically anti-choice supreme court. Brett Kavanaugh, the Trump-appointed justice best known for being accused of sexual assault and braying that he likes beer, authored the opinion that maintained the status quo with regard to the drug’s availability. Mifepristone is still banned in states with abortion bans. But it has not been made more difficult to get in states without them. There’s a reason why anti-choice groups are targeting mifepristone. In the more than two decades since the drug was first approved by the FDA, it has revolutionized abortion care. Whereas previously, abortions were largely surgical procedures, mifepristone was the first safe and effective method for terminating a pregnancy by ingesting a pill. It allowed abortions to be conducted at a patient’s convenience, and in the privacy of her home. A slim majority of abortions in the US were already conducted with mifepristone before Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, but in the years since Roe’s reversal, the use of the pills has risen even further: now, 63% of abortions are performed using mifepristone. And because of the FDA’s 2021 ruling allowing the drug to be administered via telemedicine – one of the modes of access that the AHM suit was seeking to end – not all of those mifepristone abortions are happening in states where abortion is legal. That’s because, since Dobbs, providers in Democratic-controlled states – particularly those that have shield laws that protect providers from out-of-state liability – have been prescribing the pills to women in Republican-controlled states via telemedicine, sending abortion pills into those ban states via the mail. Some estimates posit that more than 8,000 abortion seekers in ban states receive the pills this way every month – safely and secretly ending their pregnancies in defiance of local law. Because mifepristone is safe and effective – because it is easy to use, easy to access and difficult to track – the anti-choice movement will not stop looking for ways to restrict or ban it. And despite the justices’ ruling in this latest case, it is likely that the supreme court will look to help them. This particular case isn’t even dead: back at the district court, Judge Kacsmaryk has already allowed three states – Missouri, Kansas and Idaho – to join as plaintiffs, and their claims will go forward. It is likely, too, that the anti-choice lawyers bringing the suit will soon find plaintiffs with more plausible standing claims. When those plaintiffs reach the supreme court, there is every indication that they will find a sympathetic audience for their merits claims in the court’s conservative supermajority. As Mary Ziegler, a law professor and historian of the anti-abortion movement, put it, “One could read parts of this opinion as creating a roadmap [for] future plaintiffs who do want to establish standing.” We already know that this court wants to ban abortion nationwide, and to limit abortion access as much as possible in the meantime. And at least some of the justices will all but openly work in tandem with the conservative legal movement to find the right opportunity to do it. In the meantime, the choice to remand the case for lack of standing may be meant to give the court a little bit of much-needed good PR. As the nation careens toward the November elections, a contest in which Americans’ anger over Dobbs is expected to play a crucial part, the court is reeling from a series of cascading ethics scandals. Their approval is in the toilet; their justices keep getting caught accepting lavish vacations from billionaires, or seemingly endorsing coups with cryptic flag displays outside their mansions. Later this term, the justices are expected to partially nullify a federal law creating minimum standards of care in emergency rooms, so as to allow states to ban life- and health-saving abortions. That case, over the federal statute called Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, is likely to cost hundreds or thousands of Americans their lives. In these circumstances, the justices might not mind taking some of the heat off themselves by kicking the can down the road another year or two before they restrict mifepristone. After all, it’s not like they won’t get another chance.

"abortion","Activists could be jailed for six months for protesting outside MPs’ homes","Activists could be jailed for up to six months for protesting outside MPs’ homes in England and Wales under a new law aimed at tackling harassment of politicians after a surge of intimidation complaints. The law would criminalise protests outside the homes of MPs, peers and councillors as well as others who have stood for public office – and is likely to draw further criticism that the government is squeezing the right to protest. The government is to amend the crime and policing bill on Tuesday to formally bar the protests and to impose criminal sanctions. Home Office sources described such protests as “toxic behaviour in UK politics” and said the amendment would introduce a criminal offence of protesting outside the home of someone in public office where their intention is to influence them in their role or an aspect of their private life. A survey by Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, found almost all MPs (96%) had experienced at least one instance of harassment or intimidation. Just Stop Oil, whose activists sang climate crisis-inspired Christmas carols outside Keir Starmer’s home, has previously defended the need to directly target MPs. It said it was a crucial tool to influence policy, though the group has since changed its tactics to stop high-profile stunts. Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said the level of abuse faced by politicians was “truly shocking – it’s a threat to our democracy. People should be able to participate in our politics without fearing for their own or their family’s safety. “When good people choose not to put themselves forward, communities lose out and the country is poorer for it.” Jarvis said the measure was “a serious but necessary and proportionate step. Targeting public office holders at their homes crosses a line – it’s intimidation, not protest, and we’re putting a stop to it.” The change has been backed by the Jo Cox Foundation, set up in the name of the murdered Labour MP who was attacked outside her constituency surgery by a far-right terrorist. “Protest and robust debate are important to our democracy, and there are many ways that people can make their voices heard without crossing the line into intimidation at someone’s home,” the organisation said. Starmer was understood to have been furious about Gaza protests outside his north London home by Youth Demand when he was leader of the opposition. The group placed children’s shoes outside his door while demanding further opposition from Labour to arms sales to Israel. Three people were charged under section 42 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which already covers harassment at a home address. Protesters were also arrested for targeting the constituency home of Rishi Sunak. Home Office sources said the amendment would expand the scope of police powers to cover a wider range of behaviours and to give clarity to officers. Some MPs have previously complained that police have taken a laxer approach to protests outside their family homes, including when children were present. The former chair of the defence select committee Tobias Ellwood was targeted by dozens of pro-Gaza protesters at his home in Bournemouth, calling him complicit in genocide. The former Conservative MP Mike Freer said last year he was stepping down as an MP because of the repeated targeting of his constituency office, including in an arson attack. The Labour MP Stella Creasy has also condemned the targeting of MPs at their homes, having been the target of anti-abortion protesters in her Walthamstow constituency. Youth Demand recently staged a protest with body bags outside the home of David Lammy, when he was the foreign secretary. They said the government was “allowing Israel to murder children en masse”. The amendment excludes official residences – so would allow protests outside Downing Street or grace-and-favour homes for the prime minister or other ministers such as Chequers or Dorneywood.","2025-11-03T20:10:11Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/activists-could-be-jailed-for-six-months-for-protesting-outside-mps-homes"
"abortion","Nigel Farage accused of ‘fantasy promises’ with expensive policy pledges","Nigel Farage has been accused of leaving a multibillion-pound black hole at the heart of his party’s spending plans after unveiling a series of expensive policy pledges to be paid for by cutting nonexistent items of government spending. The Reform UK leader laid out a series of economic promises at a speech on Tuesday designed to take advantage of disquiet among Labour voters at the government’s policies on taxes and benefits. But while Farage promised up to £80bn worth of new spending – including scrapping the two-child benefit cap and increasing winter fuel payments – he did not explain exactly how they could be paid for. Helen Miller, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “The risk is that we hear much more about sizeable giveaways on tax and benefits while getting nothing like the same amount of specificity about the big cuts to spending on public services that would be needed for the plan to be implementable.” One of Farage’s main revenue-raising policies is to scrap the government’s commitment to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said would save £45bn a year, citing calculations by the Institute for Government (IfG). But Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the IfG, said the Reform leader had used a figure that included both public sector and private sector investment. “The bulk of spending on energy infrastructure is going to come from the private sector – but closing private sector projects won’t generate money for the government,” she said. Labour accused Reform of making “fantasy promises”, while the Liberal Democrats called his speech “Trussonomics on steroids”. The Climate Change Committee says net zero will require investment of £26bn a year, more than two-thirds of which will be provided by the private sector. That will be offset, however, by about £22bn a year of savings the policy will enable. Tim Montgomerie, a political commentator and Reform supporter, told the BBC: “I wouldn’t say the numbers do add up yet, I readily concede that.” He said it was too far away from the election to demand the party deliver a fully costed policy platform. Farage himself admitted his sums might not add up, but insisted they gave “an idea of direction, policy, of priorities, of what we think is important, of what we think it is going to cost”. The Reform leader set out his latest policy pledges during a speech in central London at which he made three main policy announcements: ending the two-child benefit cap, reversing the cuts to winter fuel payments and increasing tax breaks for married couples. He refused, however, to guarantee keeping the pensions triple lock, which ensures the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5% a year. The IFS calculated that when added to a separate promise to increase the threshold at which people start paying income taxes to £20,000, the policies could cost between £50bn and £80bn a year. Farage said his policies were in part about fairness, but also designed to encourage families to have more children, a social policy frequently espoused on the right. “We believe lifting the two-child cap is the best thing to do, not because we support a benefits culture but because we believe for lower-paid workers this actually makes having children just a little bit easier for them,” he said. He also promised more generous tax breaks for married people should he win the next election, saying he would raise the amount of tax-free allowance that someone can transfer to their spouse from £1,260 to £5,000. He added that he wanted more stringent controls on abortion as well. “I think it’s ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous, that we can allow abortion up to 24 weeks, and yet, if a child is born prematurely at 22 weeks, your local hospital will move heaven and earth and probably succeed in that child surviving and going on and living a normal life,” he said.","2025-05-27T18:04:28Z","https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/27/nigel-farage-refuses-to-commit-to-keeping-pensions-triple-lock-if-he-wins-next-election"
"abortion","Kamala Harris blames Donald Trump for Arizona abortion-ban debacle in speech","Kamala Harris pinned the blame for Arizona’s abortion ban squarely on Donald Trump, who she described as the “architect of this healthcare crisis” in a speech at a campaign event in Tucson on Friday. The state was left reeling after the Arizona supreme court ruled earlier this week that a civil war-era law banning abortion in the state with almost no exceptions is now enforceable. “Here in Arizona they have turned back the clock to the 1800s to take away a woman’s most fundamental right – the right to make decisions about her own body,” the vice-president said, adding that women in the state now “live under one of the most extreme abortion bans in our nation”. “The overturning of Roe was, without any question, a seismic event and this ban here in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,” she said. The decision in Arizona will have major implications for reproductive healthcare across the US south-west and will likely make abortion a defining issue of the 2024 race. Republicans in the state, who cheered the overturning of Roe v Wade and once passionately supported a ban, including the far-right Senate candidate Kari Lake, have suddenly backpedalled. The ban was made possible by Trump, Harris argued, who had said he is “proudly” responsible for the supreme court overturning Roe v Wade in 2022. “Former president Donald Trump did this. During his campaign in 2016, Donald Trump said women should be punished for seeking an abortion,” she said. Arizona’s ban is a new inflection point, Harris said. “It has demonstrated once and for all that overturning Roe was just the opening act of a larger strategy to take women’s rights and freedoms, part of a full-on attack, state by state, on reproductive freedom.” The law in Arizona, which predates its statehood, does not provide exceptions for rape or incest and abortions are permitted only if the mother’s life is at risk. Trump, like other high-profile Republicans, has argued Arizona’s court went too far: “That’ll be straightened out, and as you know, it’s all about states’ rights.” Lake, who had previously expressed her support for the ban and even cited the number of the 1864 code, said this week that she agrees with Trump and has urged lawmakers to repeal it. Support for abortion in the US has been at record highs. Arizona’s Republican lawmakers, with their sudden changes of heart, seem to be aware that the state’s drastic ban is deeply unpopular among voters and could have repercussions in November. Among those who came out against the court’s decision was Republican state representative Matt Gress. “This decision cannot stand,” said Gress. “I categorically reject rolling back the clock to a time when slavery was still legal and we could lock up women and doctors because of an abortion.” Gress had tried to bring forth a bill to repeal the ban but then voted with other Republicans to move to recess. The law does not have the support of Arizonans, Lake said in a video on Thursday. Political analysts have said that the near-total ban would help draw moderate voters to Democrats while mobilizing young voters and voters of color. The ban has fired up Democrats, who have already made Arizona a top priority in 2024 and hope the issue will mobilize voters in the state and across the US. “Arizona, this November up and down the ballot reproductive freedom is at stake, and you have the power to protect it with your vote,” Harris said.","2024-04-12T23:01:48Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/12/kamala-harris-blames-trump-arizona-abortion-ban"
"abortion","Diddy’s trial is more proof the legal system can’t handle domestic violence","Laws are for the poors Wouldn’t it be nice if, just now and again, bad things happened to bad people? Wouldn’t it be refreshing if violence against women was taken seriously instead of being treated like one big joke? Yes, but alas, that is not the world we live in. Over here in reality, we’ve got an adjudicated sexual predator as president, a defense secretary who has been accused of sexual assault and aggressive behaviour towards his second wife, and a supreme court where a third of the male justices who get a final say on legal issues have been accused of sexual misconduct. And we’ve got Sean “Diddy” Combs: the disgraced entertainer who escaped this week with what many people consider to be a slap on the wrist after a New York jury delivered a mixed verdict in his seven-week federal sex-trafficking trial. The trial was focused on allegations that Combs had coerced two women, including his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, to take part in “freak offs”: drug-fueled sexual encounters involving hired male prostitutes and humiliating acts. I don’t want to downplay the Diddy verdict. While Combs was acquitted on the most serious federal charges, of racketeering conspiracy and sex-trafficking, he was still found guilty of the lesser charges of transporting the male prostitutes he allegedly forced women to have sex with across state lines. The disgraced musician was also denied bail and is facing a barrage of new civil cases alleging abuse and assault. While we still don’t know how much time (if any) Combs will be sentenced to, he did not get off scot-free. I also don’t want to boil the results of a complex trial down to “misogyny”. It would be overly simplistic to say that the jury of eight men and four women in the Diddy trial simply didn’t believe women. The fact is Diddy was not on trial for being an abuser, or a bad person, or for his highly publicized battery of Cassie, one horrifying instance of which was caught on camera and the subject of a previous civil case. He was on trial for a specific set of charges, the most serious of which the prosecution did not have enough evidence to prove. But this is not to say that justice was done. Far from it. The trial is yet another demonstration that the legal system is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of intimate partner violence, the ways in which survivors deal with trauma, and the uneven power dynamics weaponized by abusers. If we had better legal frameworks for domestic violence and coercive control, perhaps prosecutors would not have turned to trafficking charges to try to secure justice. “Trafficking cases come with longer statutes of limitations, more severe penalties and more public support,” notes the human-trafficking expert Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco in USA Today. “And existing domestic violence statutes are often outdated or ill-equipped to address coercive control, especially when the abuser is wealthy, powerful and legally savvy.” It’s not just the law that is ill-equipped to address coercive control – this complex issue is still minimized by some factions of the media. A Washington Post piece (written by two women), for example, described Combs as a “music producer turned modern-day Gatsby”, a framing which casts the “freak offs” as hedonism rather than something more sinister. The writer Sarah Kendzior notes that allusions to F Scott Fitzgerald’s Jay Gatsby have been used to soften the image of high-level sexual predators like Jeffrey Epstein for decades. In the courts of public opinion, men like Combs are also far too often seen as playboys rather than predators. After the verdict on Wednesday, CNN reported that several spectators could be seen pouring baby oil on themselves, along with wearing T-shirts reading: A Freako is not a RICO (RICO is a reference to the racketeering charges). Perhaps what is most depressing about the Diddy verdict is that it is all too easy to imagine a path in which Combs finds his way back to prominence in public life. Donald Trump hasn’t ruled out pardoning Diddy and it is not inconceivable that he might; birds of a feather stick together, after all. Chris Brown still has a music career despite being charged with felony assault following a domestic violence incident when he beat up Rihanna in 2009. Brett Ratner is directing the very expensive Prime Video documentary about Melania Trump despite being accused of sexual misconduct by six women (he has denied the claims). With enough money, good lawyers and the right connections, you can get away with almost anything. If you can call Sean Combs ‘Diddy’, you can respect someone’s preferred pronouns The indictment against Diddy is titled United States of America v Sean Combs, AKA ‘Puff Daddy’, AKA ‘P.Diddy’, AKA ‘Diddy’, AKA ‘PD’, AKA ‘Love’. And yet some people think that calling someone by their preferred pronouns is too complicated. Horrific sexual violence used against Tigray’s women “Tigray is often described as a forgotten war,” Tess McClure writes in an incredibly disturbing but essential read. “If it has been forgotten, it is not by those who endured it, but by the global powers that looked away from one of the most brutal conflicts of this century.” That brutality includes reported wartime sexual abuse by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers against tens of thousands of Tigrayan women.

"abortion","Senior Labour figures seeking to water down plans to decriminalise abortion ","Senior Labour figures want to water down proposed legislation to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales ahead of a historic Commons debate on the issue. Later this spring, MPs are due to have a free vote on a proposal by the Labour MP Diana Johnson to abolish the criminal offence associated with a woman ending her own pregnancy. The proposal from Johnson, who chairs the home affairs select committee, has support from MPs on both sides of the house and senior doctors’ groups. There has been a widespread expectation it will pass, in a major change to abortion law. In England and Wales it is a criminal offence to have an abortion after 24 weeks, carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Campaigners supporting Johnson’s amendment, which would remove this offence, say that would ensure no woman can be prosecuted or jailed for ending a pregnancy. Instead, abortion would be treated as a healthcare issue. This would bring the law in England and Wales in line with Northern Ireland, where abortion was fully decriminalised in 2019. In Northern Ireland women can no longer be prosecuted for terminations after 24 weeks, although such terminations are extremely rare as even early-stage abortions are offered only in clinics. Some senior Labour figures have privately expressed concern that Johnson’s proposal goes too far because of the provision of telemedicine in England and Wales, whereby a woman seeking an early-stage abortion can be prescribed tablets at home without seeing a doctor. Under rules introduced during the Covid pandemic and later made permanent, women in England and Wales can obtain abortion pills at home after a remote consultation. This is not an option in Northern Ireland, where the first of two tablets required for a termination can be administered only at a clinic. There are concerns that under Johnson’s proposal, a woman who misleads an abortion provider to obtain pills to terminate a pregnancy at home after 24 weeks would not be committing an offence. There are also fears such a change could be counterproductive by drawing backlash from anti-abortion groups or rolling back telemedicine in England and Wales. “There are some people who are questioning whether this is the right thing to do,” one Labour MP said. Another Labour source said: “There is definitely a large group of undecideds [and] lots of different people working on alternatives.” Two influential Labour backbenchers have been in discussions about drafting different amendments to modernise abortion law. Some senior Labour figures want to see a narrower proposal that in effect ensures women can never be imprisoned for ending a pregnancy, but does not completely remove the criminal offence. The Commons is expected to have a historic debate on abortion when the criminal justice bill returns to the house after Easter. Johnson’s proposal has been made in the form of an amendment to that bill. Calls to overhaul the law have grown louder since Carla Foster, a mother of three, was jailed last year for ending her pregnancy by using pills after the legal time limit. Her sentence was reduced on appeal. Abortion law in England and Wales relies on the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which outlawed terminations and is still used to prosecute women today. The 1967 Abortion Act decriminalised abortion in some circumstances, but is framed in a way that means abortion is not a right. Instead, it exempts women from prosecution when two doctors agree the pregnancy would be a risk to their physical or mental health. The act originally allowed terminations up to 28 weeks, but this was lowered to 24 weeks in a 1991 amendment. The 1967 act never extended to Northern Ireland, where abortion was illegal until a 2019 act repealed key sections of the 1861 legislation. A new legal framework was introduced in 2020 to set up abortion provision in Northern Ireland up to 24 weeks. As a result, the law in Northern Ireland is more up to date than England and Wales. Scotland has separate laws and has set up a working group to examine decriminalisation. Abortion is treated as a matter of conscience in parliamentary votes, so MPs from all parties are allowed to vote whichever way they wish, without frontbench direction. Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, has suggested she could vote in favour of decriminalisation. A source close to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said he was minded to vote whichever way Atkins does. Johnson’s amendment has been signed by senior MPs including the Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Harriet Harman, and the Conservatives Tracey Crouch and Dehenna Davison. It has support from MPs from six parties, which gives it a strong chance of being selected for a vote by the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. The amendment also has the backing of the heads of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Midwives. Johnson told the Guardian: “These laws are no longer fit for purpose. This is an opportunity to take a step forward and treat a woman’s right to choose as a healthcare matter and not a criminal matter. Society has moved on. Other countries around the world – France, Australia, New Zealand – have decriminalised abortion, as we did in Northern Ireland a few years ago. Why should a woman in Birmingham be treated any differently to a woman in Belfast?” Harman said: “Women needing to terminate their pregnancy need help, support and healthcare, not police, prosecutors and courts.” Rachael Clarke, the chief of staff at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said: “Every single Labour MP elected in 2019 was elected on a manifesto committed to the decriminalisation of abortion.”","2024-03-23T06:00:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/23/senior-labour-figures-seeking-water-down-plans-decriminalise-abortion"
"abortion","Why does this billionaire have 100 kids in 12 countries?","Move over, Elon, another billionaire baby daddy is in town Pavel Durov is a Russian-born billionaire whose interests include doing half-naked photoshoots with baby goats and having lots and lots of (human) kids. The 40-year-old billionaire founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram revealed last year– in a post on his own app – that while he isn’t married and prefers to live alone, he has over 100 biological children in 12 countries via sperm donation. Durov’s reproductive choices made headlines again this week after the tech tycoon told the French political magazine Le Point that he is going to leave his fortune, estimated at almost $14bn, to all of his children. Durov has six children he fathered naturally with three different partners as well as the children he has via sperm donation. “They are all my children and will all have the same rights. I don’t want them to tear each other apart after my death,” he told Le Point. What possessed Durov, who was charged last year in France over allegations that Telegram is being used for illicit activity, to populate the world with so many mini-mes? (He has denied failing to cooperate with authorities and Telegram has denied having poor moderation.) Well, like Elon Musk and a number of other tech types, Durov is a pronatalist who is worried about global fertility rates declining. He’s chosen to take a hands-on approach to tackling the issue, funding free IVF treatments for women at AltraVita IVF Clinic in Moscow for anyone who uses his sperm. If you’re interested, and I’m sure that a lot of people will be now that Durov has laid out the terms of his will, he’s still got sperm on ice at the clinic. Durov first donated his sperm over 15 years ago, in order to help a friend. Then, he said in his Telegram post last year, he realised he ought to donate more widely. “The boss of the clinic told me that ‘high quality donor material’ was in short supply and that it was my civic duty to donate more sperm to anonymously help more couples,” Durov said in the post. Durov added that he wants to “help destigmatize the whole notion of sperm donation and incentivize more healthy men to do it.” Having used a sperm donor to conceive my own child, I’m all for destigmatizing sperm donation. Particularly as there is a major lack of sperm donors among certain demographics: at one point last year, for example, there were only a dozen Black sperm donors at the four main cryobanks in the US. But, and this is a very big but, there is an enormous difference between destigmatizing artificial insemination and one person thinking it is their “civic duty” to conceive 100-plus children. Allowing a single individual to procreate so prolifically raises complex ethical issues. There’s the possibility of accidental incest in the future, as well as the potential psychological impact that stems from someone discovering they have 100 siblings. There are also potential medical problems: earlier this year it was reported that the sperm of a man with a rare cancer-causing mutation was used to conceive at least 67 children. Is Durov even allowed to donate to so many different couples? The short answer is yes. The law regarding how many children can be conceived from one donor is complicated and varies from country to country. In places like France there are strict national limits while in the US (and Russia) there is no national law limiting the number of donations one person can make. Reputable cryobanks, however, do claim to have their own self-imposed limits. The European Sperm Bank applies a worldwide limit of 75 families for each sperm donor. California Cryobank, one of the largest providers in the US, has said it tries to limit donations to about 25-30 families. However these cryobanks are also extremely expensive, particularly after the pandemic, when shortages meant spermflation kicked in, and there is a completely unregulated market for sperm via Facebook groups and private websites where people can match with potential donors. This has allowed unscrupulous people like Jonathan Jacob Meijer of the Netherlands to father hundreds of children. As artificial insemination becomes more common, there is a desperate need to better regulate the industry and limit the number of children conceived from a single sperm donor. Indeed, Sweden, along with seven other countries including Belgium, raised the topic with EU ministers this week. “This issue has been left unresolved for too long,” an official from Belgium told POLITICO, adding that an “international limit is a first step in the right direction.” Let’s hope that these limits get put in place sooner rather than later. Because I have an inkling that Elon Musk, who seems to be going a little off the rails, might take all the chatter about Durov’s progeny as a personal challenge. New Rio law requires public hospitals to display anti-abortion signs These include messages like: “Did you know that the unborn child is discarded as hospital waste?” The Guardian reports that this is the “latest example of a growing trend across Brazil to further restrict access to abortion in a country that already has some of the world’s most restrictive laws”. Melanoma cases rise in women under 50 The caveat here is that overdiagnosis could be contributing to this increasing.

"abortion","Mississippi declares infant deaths emergency as CDC program that could have helped is halted","The Trump administration’s shake-up of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has forced Mississippi to stop gathering critical data on women’s experiences before, during and after pregnancy – even as the state recently declared a public health emergency over its surging infant mortality rate. Mississippi has suspended data collection for Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams), a national database that has been integral to policymaking on maternal and infant health for nearly four decades, the Guardian has learned. Prams functions as a partnership between state-level health officials and a little-known but influential CDC agency called the Division of Reproductive Health, which has lost most of its staff – nearly 100 people – in the Trump administration’s purges of federal workers, according to records in a lawsuit filed by several Democratic-led states over the purges. As a result, many of the division’s projects, including Prams, have sputtered to a halt, the lawsuit alleges. The division will likely be unable to obtain accurate nationwide data on maternal and infant health in 2024, 2025 and 2026, an unnamed CDC staffer said in one declaration included in the lawsuit. Researchers rely on Prams data to test out potential health interventions to improve maternal and child health, while states use it to make the case for federal funding for programs that aim to reduce infant deaths, improve care for women and help children with special needs. The changes at the division forced Mississippi to terminate its 2024 Prams data collection and has delayed its 2025 collection, a Mississippi health department spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson also attributed the work stoppage to “a federal directive” issued in January, but did not answer follow-up questions about the nature of that directive. In the meantime, the spokesperson said, the department is at work analyzing its existing Prams data. In response to several questions for this story, a CDC spokesperson said that states received funding for 2025 data collection in May, to begin collecting data this summer, and that the agency “plans to support Prams data management activities” for the 2024 and 2025 data. Neither the CDC nor Mississippi responded to follow up questions clarifying why the data collection has been stopped. Mississippi declared a public health emergency in August after its health department found that the state infant mortality rate had increased in 2024 to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births – its highest point in more than a decade. Between 2014 and 2024, more than 3,500 babies died before their first birthday. While researchers can still use birth and death certificates to examine general trends in infant mortality, those records lack the granular detail tracked by Prams. “Prams is basically the only state and national dataset that gets data every year about the health of pregnant and postpartum women and their infants,” said Rita Hamad, an associate professor of social and behavioral sciences at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. The lawsuit by Democratic-led states allege that, although some “contract reviewers” recently embarked on data collection for Prams, “their efforts were unsupervised and uncoordinated leading to data collection that is unusable by plaintiff states.” The disintegration of the Division of Reproduction Health means there is no one left to oversee Prams and shape the data into working condition, one former CDC employee told the Guardian. “If you don’t maintain the staff, the funding isn’t going to be effectively used,” the employee said. “Perinatal epidemiologists are not a dime a dozen. Trying to fire them and yet still maintain a healthy society for moms and babies is just not possible.” ‘What are we changing for families?’ In its declaration that Mississippi’s infant mortality rate constituted a public health emergency, the state health department said it would work to increase counties’ ability to offer prenatal care, educate families on safe sleep practices for infants and strengthen a program that provides home visits to expectant moms. The declaration does not unlock extra funding; a department spokesperson called it “an administrative tool to help us expedite setting the plans and resources in place”. “Part of the plan includes a comprehensive, large-scale public relations campaign that is in the works,” the spokesperson added. But advocates believe that expanding pre- and postnatal care, while helpful, is not enough. The Trump administration plans to cut more than $1tn from Medicaid, the US government insurance program for low-income people. Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the advocacy group Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, wants Mississippi to devote more state dollars to offsetting those cuts. Medicaid pays for nearly 60% of births in Mississippi, a share that is about 20% higher than the national average. She also wants Mississippi, which currently abides by the US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, to set a higher minimum wage. “It’s a poverty issue,” Welchlin said of the infant mortality crisis. “If folks have higher incomes, they’re better able to take care of themselves and their families.” The Mississippi health department’s ability to address one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Mississippi, congenital anomalies, will also likely be hobbled by the state’s near-total abortion ban. Research has repeatedly linked abortion bans to higher infant mortality, in part because they force people to carry pregnancies with congenital anomalies that they otherwise would have ended. Advocates are calling on the state to better address the racial disparities in infant mortality. In Mississippi, as in the rest of the US, Black people face disproportionately high rates of infant mortality. The state’s health department found that, in 2024, the infant mortality rate among white people was 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births. Among Black individuals, it was 15.2. Nakeitra Burse leads Six Dimensions, a Mississippi public health company, and sits on the state’s maternal mortality review committee. Her aunt and sister-in-law died within weeks of giving birth, while her sister was diagnosed with preeclampsia and ultimately gave birth to a son who died at eight months old. All were Black. “These are women who had education. My aunt had a master’s degree. They had access to healthcare. They had family advocates,” Burse said. “They had all the boxes that America wants you to check off so that you can navigate this system in a healthy way, but they still were not able to get out of the system healthy.” But experts say Trump’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is hampering efforts to fight racial disparities in public health. In Mississippi, government records show, the administration terminated a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant that funded a “partnership to optimize equity in maternal and infant health”. At the time of the termination, records indicate that the NIH still owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the grant recipient Delta Health Alliance, a non-profit focused on improving the lives of people in the Mississippi Delta, a region whose population is predominantly Black. (The organization did not reply for a request for comment on the termination.) Ultimately, Hamad believes the attacks on Prams will lead to higher maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. “We don’t have ways to track the risk factors and we can’t study the policies to fix the problems,” she said. “It’s really gonna be a catastrophe moving forward.”","2025-09-16T10:00:35Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/mississippi-infant-deaths-cdc-prams"
"abortion","France to make abortion a constitutional right after senate vote","France is preparing to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right at a joint session of parliament next week, after the senate voted in favour on Wednesday night. France would write into its constitution the “guaranteed freedom” of women to choose an abortion. The French government, lawmakers and senators had argued that the right to abortion needed full constitutional protection as it comes under threat in the US and other countries in Europe. After the US supreme court overturned in 2022 a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee abortion, senators and lawmakers in France have argued that in Europe abortion rights are also at risk of being rolled back or limited, citing countries such as Hungary, Poland, Italy and Spain. After a long senate debate on Wednesday, the French prime minister, Gabriel Attal, said: “When women’s rights are attacked in the world, France stands up and places itself at the avant garde of progress.” The French justice minister, Éric Dupond-Moretti, said: “This vote is historic … It states to all those who don’t yet know it that the women in our country are free … and to what point we are attached to that freedom.” Mélanie Vogel, a Green senator, who had campaigned for the constitutional change said: “This is a historic, feminist victory.” The Communist senator Ian Brossat said: “It will be a victory for women across the world.” The change to the French constitution is now expected to win the approval of the necessary three-fifths majority of a joint session of parliament which has been called for Monday, and which is traditionally held at the Palace of Versailles. The president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had promised to make women’s freedom to choose an abortion “irreversible”. Writing the right to abortion into the constitution is seen as a way of protecting the law that decriminalised abortion in France in 1975. The Socialist senator Laurence Rossignol argued that wherever there were gains in the public and political space by “far-right, ultra-conservatives, populist nationalists … whatever name you give them, whenever they get to power, women’s rights are their target”. The centrist senator Dominique Vérien said anti-abortion movements were becoming “more and more pernicious” in France, citing attacks on family planning centres in France, anti-abortion stickers placed on rental bikes in Paris and the TV channel CNews, which this week apologised for a broadcast in which it called abortion “the number one cause of mortality in the world” ahead of “cancer and tobacco”. Vérien said: “Let’s not be naive, France is permeable to these movements. We have to protect this freedom.” In 2022, the French parliament voted to extend France’s legal limit for ending a pregnancy from 12 to 14 weeks, amid anger that thousands of women were forced to travel abroad each year to terminate pregnancies in countries including the Netherlands, Spain or England.","2024-02-28T20:46:32Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/28/france-to-make-abortion-a-constitutional-right-after-senate-vote"
"abortion","Despite the supreme court ruling for the abortion pill, the battle is far from over","The US supreme court has rejected an effort by anti-abortion activists to roll back access to a common abortion pill – but the battle over the pill is far from over, both in the courts and in legislatures. In a 9-0 unanimous decision on Thursday, the US supreme court ruled that anti-abortion activists did not have standing, or the legal right to sue, over the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulation of mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in a US medication abortion. But because the case turns on an interpretation of legal doctrine, the justices left open the possibility that someone else may challenge mifepristone in the future. Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a federal judge in Texas who first heard arguments in the case, has allowed Missouri, Idaho and Kansas to join the case as plaintiffs. Although the supreme court declined to let those states join the case once it was before Scotus, the states may continue litigating it at a lower-court level and evade the standing defects that doomed the case’s original plaintiffs. The powerful anti-abortion group, SBA Pro-Life America, already emphasized that possibility in the organization’s statement on the Thursday ruling. “The pro-life states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are seeking to take up the challenge based on harms suffered by women in their states,” the group said. Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis who studies the legal history of reproduction, noted that “this ruling doesn’t preclude anyone else from bringing the same claim. “Until or unless the supreme court actually rejects these claims on the merits, they’re not going anywhere,” she said. As medication abortion now accounts for more than 60% of all US abortions, gutting access to it has become a major goal of the anti-abortion movement in the years since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. If anti-abortion advocates are not able to curb access to mifepristone through the courts, they may be able to do so through the White House. An administration headed by Donald Trump could, for example, try to direct the FDA to change its approach to mifepristone. The Thursday ruling, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, seems to touch on this possibility. “The plaintiffs may present their concerns and objections to the President and FDA in the regulatory process, or to Congress and the President in the legislative process,” Kavanaugh wrote. “And they may also express their views about abortion and mifepristone to fellow citizens, including in the political and electoral processes.” Elizabeth Sepper, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, emphasized that “they don’t mean Joe Biden”. “I think there’s a very strong signal in the opinion that, well, if and when Donald Trump wins the presidency, head straight to the administration and ask them to change the approval of mifepristone,” she told the Guardian. Still, Nicole Huberfeld, a health law professor at Boston University’s school of public health, is not convinced such an effort would be successful. “It’s not as if the president can just wave his hand and have things happen at the FDA,” Huberfeld said. “You can’t always tell the scientists what you want them to say.” A future Trump administration could also target mifepristone using the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that, some anti-abortion activists argue, bans the mailing of all abortion-related materials. The Biden administration has disagreed with that interpretation, issuing guidance arguing that the Comstock Act only bans such materials if the sender intends to use them to break the law, but a Trump administration may take a more hardline approach. Without involving Congress, Trump could use the Comstock Act to outlaw the mailing of mifepristone – which would result in a de facto ban on the pill. Project 2025, a playbook written by the influential conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation, recommends that a future conservative administration do just that. During oral arguments in the mifepristone case, both Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas – the most conservative justices on the supreme court – brought up the Comstock Act. However, there was no mention of the law in either Thursday’s majority opinion or a concurrence by Thomas. Sepper suspects that the omission was a canny play by the conservative faction of the supreme court. “There’s been concerns in the conservative legal movement that admitting Comstock would be revived in a Trump administration would be a poor political play. And so not mentioning Comstock at all is just wise strategy,” Sepper said. “It certainly diverts attention from Comstock.”","2024-06-13T19:39:14Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/13/supreme-court-abortion-pill-mifepristone"
"abortion","First Thing: At least 13 people killed and dozens injured in Israeli airstrike near Beirut hospital","Good morning. At least 13 people were killed and 57 injured in an Israeli airstrike on Monday near Hariri hospital, Beirut’s main government hospital, the health ministry said, revising upwards its initial death toll of four. Israel claimed the strike was aimed at a Hezbollah target, not the hospital. On Tuesday, Hezbollah launched a barrage of rockets into Israel, sparking air-raid sirens but causing no apparent damage or injuries. Israel continued to bombard Beirut, Lebanon and north Gaza with shelling overnight, as the humanitarian crisis from the conflict continues to grow. What has the impact been on Lebanese civilians? Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, launched 1 October, has displaced more than 1.2 million people multiple times, according to Lebanese authorities. At least 2,483 people have been killed, according to the health ministry. What is the US doing? Secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv, where he will meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Blinken is expected to stress the need for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and to discuss securing the release of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. As Israel’s most powerful ally and weapons supplier, the US has sent more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000lb bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles since the start of its war on Gaza. Liz Cheney urges conservatives to back Kamala Harris over abortion Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman and longtime opponent of abortion rights, on Monday condemned Republican-imposed bans on the procedure and urged conservatives to support Democrat Kamala Harris for president. Cheney was speaking during three joint events with the vice-president in three swing states aimed at prising suburban Republican voters away from party nominee Donald Trump. She has become the Democrats’ most prominent conservative surrogate and is rumoured to be in contention for a seat in a potential Harris cabinet. What did Cheney say? “I’m pro-life and I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states since Dobbs … I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who – as the vice-president said, in some cases have died – who can’t get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.” What are the polls saying? The election is essentially deadlocked. Harris has small polling leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump has small polling leads in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, but all are well within the margin of error and all the races in the all-important battleground states remain too close to call.

"abortion","Such Brave Girls season two review – this Bafta-winning comedy is startlingly brilliant","There’s a scene early on in the first series of Such Brave Girls that sums the whole thing up nicely. Josie – a millennial not long out of a mental health crisis, now just in a general, all-encompassing life crisis – has helped her sister to bleach her hair. Unfortunately, she has neglected to tell Billie that the plastic bag she put over her head has left a massive, Shrek-green Asda logo on the dye job. Billie – who alternates between sweetly naive and absolutely petrifying, with little warning – lunges at Josie and smothers her new dress in ketchup, before threatening to kill herself. The girls’ mother will later attempt to return said dress to the shop – stains and all – feigning tears as she tells the shop assistant how much debt she’s in. Suffice to say, Such Brave Girls isn’t a wholesome coming-of-age affair. It is, however, a brilliant, startlingly feral comedy, one which scooped the scripted comedy Bafta last year (previous winners include Derry Girls, This Country and Peep Show). The subject matter – suicide, abortion, financial ruin, deep-seated abandonment issues – sounds like the stuff of sadcoms. But what makes it stand out in a post-Waller-Bridge world is that it is an unashamed sitcom, with a regular cast and recurring gags. Think The Inbetweeners, if it had it been written by Julia Davis. It is, in fact, from the twisted mind of Kat Sadler, who plays Josie alongside her real-life sister Lizzie Davidson as Billie; the show, in particular the mental health and debt parts, are loosely based on their own lives. (There is an Inbetweeners connection, though: Simon Bird, AKA Will, is the director.) Along with Sadler and Davidson, Louise Brealey completes the troubled triad as their mum, Deb, who is just as – if not more – self-absorbed and unstable than her daughters (staunchly anti-therapy, at one point she declares that it is only “for celebrities”). Broke thanks to a runaway husband and cosplaying as a widow, Deb pins all her hopes on rich boyfriend Dev (Paul Bazely), “our Willy Wonka ticket out of fucking hell” and an actual widower. Billie, meanwhile, is both impressively nonchalant – she pitches up at an abortion clinic in the witch’s outfit from her job at Kidz Cauldron – and dangerously obsessed with on-off boyfriend Nicky (Sam Buchanan). If Billie often feels like Blanche DuBois for the TikTok generation, Josie is a more muted presence. Controlled by her sister, mother and a boyfriend she can’t stand (because she’s secretly queer), she is often afforded only a supporting role in her own life story. Series two arrives with only a smattering of preview episodes and a spoiler list that makes writing about it feel like navigating a hallway blocked by lasers. What I can say, though, is that it’s excellent, and that Josie is still completely overpowered: episode one begins with Deb and Billie forcibly removing her from an art school lecture and sticking a bag over her head to get her to comply with their latest scheme. Still repulsed by the idea of having any sort of sexual contact with Seb (Freddie Meredith), Josie becomes fixated on a fellow student, a girl named Charlie. What unfolds takes us to even darker places than series one. Sadler’s performance during Josie’s long-awaited NHS mental health assessment, in particular, is at once terrifyingly unpredictable and a complete hoot. Billie says of her sister’s unconvincing display of sanity: “Your mouth’s doing the right thing, but your eyes are trying to call the Samaritans.” Not that she is doing much better, having embarked on an inadvisable affair with an older man named Graham (he told her he wasn’t married, she told him she was 15), launching herself at him at every opportunity then rebranding herself as a sugar baby when he pays her to leave him alone. Deb’s mental state is disintegrating, too, along with her finances, and we see her careening to the supermarket on a scooter, card declined at the till. The rest of the cast remain just as compellingly pathetic, and the decision to make Seb and Dev co-workers at a banal, Wernham Hogg-esque office is a neat trick to guarantee enough screen time for both. Such Brave Girls won’t be to everyone’s tastes. In fact, there are plenty of people I can imagine not rolling about at lines like “I heard she gets a smear test every week just so someone has to look at her vagina”, or revelling in the sheer lack of empathy that every single character here has for one another. But if you like your comedy scary, lairy and perfectly portioned, it is a total knockout. Josie is pretty brave, but Sadler is even braver. • Such Brave Girls aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now in the UK and on Stan in Australia","2025-07-03T21:30:00Z","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/03/such-brave-girls-season-two-review-bbc-three"
"abortion","‘We must not stop’: potential Trump VP Ben Carson touts national abortion ban","In a new book, the retired neurosurgeon, former US housing secretary and potential Trump vice-presidential pick Ben Carson calls for a national abortion ban – a posture at odds with most Americans and even Donald Trump himself. Hailing the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson US supreme court ruling that removed the federal right to abortion, Carson writes: “We must not stop there … the battle over the lives of unborn children is not yet finished. Many states have made abortion illegal because of the Dobbs decision, yet the practice continues in many more states. “What is needed is legislation that guarantees the right to life for all American citizens, including those still in the womb. Therefore, we must be boldly vocal about saving our fellow human beings through the legislative process. They are counting on us!” Carson’s book, The Perilous Fight: Overcoming Our Culture’s War on the American Family, will be published later this month. The Guardian obtained a copy. With the book, Carson follows other potential Trump running mates in seeking to sell himself to the reading and voting public as well as the former president, among them the extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene; the former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard; and the South Dakota governor and self-confessed dog- and goat-killer Kristi Noem. No 2 to Trump may be a dubious prize – his vice-president, Mike Pence, ended up running for his life from Trump supporters who wanted to hang him on January 6 – but contenders continue to jostle. Recent reporting suggests Carson has slipped from the front rank. On Thursday, Bloomberg said Trump was closely considering Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, and three senators: Marco Rubio of Florida, JD Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina. But Carson, 72, remains close to Trump, having challenged him for the Republican nomination in 2016 – briefly leading the race – before becoming one of the only members of Trump’s cabinet to stay throughout his term, even after Trump incited the deadly January 6 attack on Congress. Carson’s hardline views on abortion are well known: during his 2016 run he ran into controversy when he likened abortion to slavery and said he wanted to see the end of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which safeguarded the federal right. His new book comes nearly two years after Roe was brought down by a supreme court to which Trump appointed three rightwing justices. Carson writes: “I’m grateful that in my lifetime I was able to hear these incredible words established by the supreme court of the United States: “Held, the constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.” Planned Parenthood v Casey was a 1992 case that upheld Roe. Thirty years later, tilted 6-3 to the right by Trump, the court brought both rulings down. Carson continues: “The supreme court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson was a crucial correction to the error of Roe v Wade, and I am certainly grateful for that correction. However, we must not stop there.” Many observers suggest Republicans should have stopped their attacks on abortion rights before achieving their goal with the fall of Roe. Public opinion remains in favour of legal abortion: according to Gallup, just 13% of Americans agree with Carson that it should be banned entirely. Since Dobbs, fueled by such voter sentiment, Democrats have enjoyed electoral victories, even in Republican-run states, when campaigning on Republican threats to women’s reproductive rights. The issue has been placed front and centre of the presidential election to come by the Biden campaign. Extreme developments among the states have included the introduction of a six-week abortion ban in Florida and in Arizona the triggering (and repeal) of a brutal ban passed in 1864, before statehood and when the age of consent there was just 10. Trump has struggled to reconcile boasts about bringing down Roe with avoiding talk of a national ban. Last month, the former president said: “States will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. Whatever they decide must be the law of the land, or in this case the law of the state. “Many states will be different, many will have a different number of weeks, some will be more conservative than others.

"abortion","JD Vance has met Jenrick on Cotswolds visit but not expected to see Badenoch","JD Vance has met Robert Jenrick during his holiday in the Cotswolds but is not expected to see the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. Jenrick held an hour-long one-on-one meeting with the US vice-president on Tuesday evening, according to a source close to the shadow justice secretary. A Conservative spokesperson said that Badenoch was also speaking to Vance this week but that scheduling time for them to meet in person had proved difficult. Both Vance and Badenoch’s teams played down the idea of a snub, but Vance’s decision to hold a meeting with Jenrick will raise eyebrows. Jenrick was defeated by Badenoch in the Conservative leadership contest last year and is widely perceived to harbour continued ambitions for the top job. He has strayed well beyond his justice brief and repeatedly caused controversy with his incendiary language on migration. There are reports that Vance will also meet Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, on Wednesday. Farage’s spokesperson did not reply to a request for comment. A Conservative source said that Jenrick was attending a drinks event with Vance on Tuesday evening alongside others, including the former chancellor George Osborne. They said Badenoch had been in contact with Vance but that they had been unable to find time for a meeting due to diary clashes. The US vice-president spent last weekend with David Lammy, the foreign secretary, while Badenoch has been in Epping and the Isle of Wight this week. Both Vance and Jenrick have expressed staunch opposition to equality, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and voiced concerns about the erosion of freedom of speech. In February, the vice-president claimed that a “backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious Britons” under threat, and he attacked the use of laws to enforce buffer zones around abortion clinics. Asked about his remarks before meeting Lammy last Friday, Vance claimed that his concerns related more widely to “the entire collective west”. Vance is on holiday in the Cotswolds with his family and has been pictured visiting the Daylesford farm shop near Chipping Norton. Responding to reports that Farage was due to meet Vance, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, called on Farage to “tell the White House that in Europe we stand together against Putin’s aggression”. He added: “But Farage won’t do that because he’s much more interested in pleasing Trump than in standing up for British values and European security.”","2025-08-12T19:10:24Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/jd-vance-has-met-robert-jenrick-on-cotswolds-visit-but-not-expected-to-see-kemi-badenoch"
"abortion","Pregnant Arizona lawmaker shares fight to get abortion, highlighting ‘cruel’ laws","When Eva Burch learned that her pregnancy was not progressing and decided to have an abortion, Burch and her husband quickly made another decision: Burch, who is a Democratic state senator in Arizona, was going to speak up about it – from the floor of the state senate. On Monday, as her voice shook and a group of women surrounded her, Burch gave a 10-minute speech about her decision and the struggle to navigate Arizona’s “coercive” maze of abortion restrictions. With her speech, Burch joined the ranks of women who have spoken out since the fall of Roe v Wade about their battles to get abortions even for nonviable pregnancies. Yet Burch, who was still pregnant when she spoke on the floor as well as during an interview, is believed to be the first pregnant state lawmaker to go into such detail about her plans to get an abortion since Roe’s demise. “If I can take this sad situation that I find myself in and make it actionable, help get people engaged, help people to turn out to vote, help people to care about this and to pay attention to their local governments – where so many of these decisions are being made – then it’s worth it to me,” Burch said. “In spite of the tragedy of it.” Burch, who has two young sons, has experienced infertility for years. She was not trying to get pregnant – but when she discovered she was, Burch and her husband were happy and hopeful. That happiness would dissolve as tests revealed Burch’s pregnancy was not advancing and would end in a miscarriage, Burch said. She had experienced a miscarriage two years earlier and knew immediately she would prefer to have an abortion. Arizona bans abortion after 15 weeks, without exceptions for rape or incest. Burch was well below that limit, but still, she said, she had to overcome an obstacle course to get care. Arizona law mandates that patients visit an abortion clinic for counseling 24 hours before undergoing the procedure. Although Burch said she had already received an ultrasound and did not need another, she said she still had to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, which involves inserting a wand into a patient’s vagina. State law also required Burch’s provider to read a statement to her about alternatives to abortion. “Some of the statements read to me, for example, advised me that there are alternatives to abortion, including adoption or parenting, which in my case is particularly unfair and unkind and cruel, since parenting is an option I would love to take on,” Burch said. “The intent is clear: they don’t want to make sure that it is accurate and appropriate care. They want patients to make a different decision. They want patients to make a decision that the legislators feel more comfortable with.” Notably, Arizona’s abortion laws remain up in the air. In 1864, before Arizona became a state, its territorial government enacted a near-total abortion ban that only permits abortions to save a patient’s life. While Roe was the law of the land, that ban went dormant; in 2022, legislators passed the 15-week abortion ban, which Roe also blocked from taking effect. When Roe fell, confusion broke out over whether the near-total ban or the 15-week ban was in effect; amid the chaos, all abortion providers in the state temporarily shut down as courts warred over the two bans. The state supreme court is now weighing whether to reinstate the near-total ban. Burch was nearly caught up in that upheaval. In June 2022, she became pregnant with another nonviable pregnancy and scheduled an abortion. The night before, Burch recalled, she started to bleed heavily and went to the emergency department. There, she learned that providers could no longer detect any activity from the tissue that would – in a healthy pregnancy – ultimately become a heart. But a doctor there refused to perform an abortion because, Burch said, she was not bleeding heavily enough. “They had offered to give me some medication to make me start bleeding again and said if I bled enough, I could have had a procedure there in the hospital,” said Burch, who is also a nurse practitioner and has worked in a women’s health clinic. “That sounded awful.” Instead, she underwent her abortion at a clinic the next day. Burch’s ordeal unfolded just two weeks before the US supreme court overturned Roe and Arizona clinics shut down. “Had the situation taken place two weeks later, I wouldn’t have been able to go access that care,” Burch said. “If I had needed to have an abortion, I would have had to leave the state to do it.” She continued: “This time around, I knew what to expect. I went in there eyes wide open. But it doesn’t make it any easier. The laws here are not going to become palatable here because patients know what’s coming. We just deserve better care than what we’re getting.” Abortion-rights supporters in Arizona are now gathering signatures for a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. Advocates in roughly a dozen states are hoping to put abortion rights on the ballot come November; so far, every time Americans have directly voted on post-Roe abortion rights, abortion-rights supporters have won. Because Arizona is an anticipated swing state in the 2024 elections, the push for the ballot measure – which Democrats also hope will boost turnout amid lackluster support for Joe Biden – is sure to attract nationwide attention. “I absolutely hope that by sharing my story,” Burch said, “we can move the needle for voters in November.”","2024-03-20T18:42:43Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/20/eva-burch-abortion-speech-arizona-senator"
"abortion","Polish MPs debate easing strict abortion rules in test of new government","Poland’s parliament has begun a long-awaited debate on loosening the country’s near total ban on abortion, in what campaigners have described as a crucial test of the country’s new government. More than three years after hundreds of thousands of people poured on to the streets wielding placards that read “the revolution has a uterus” and “my body, my choice”, MPs on Thursday will consider four proposals. Two of the bills are aimed at legalising abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy and another is focused on decriminalisation. The fourth, introduced by the conservative Third Way alliance, seeks a return to the strict 1993 laws hammered out between political leaders and the Catholic church, which were tightened in 2020. The debate is expected to last hours and MPs are due to vote on Friday on whether to send the bills to a special commission for further study. “The state can’t pretend that abortion doesn’t exist - they’re being done, always have and always will,” Katarzyna Kotula, the equality minister, told parliament. “The state must do everything to ensure that abortion is safe, accessible, legal and takes place in appropriate conditions,” she added. Poland’s Federation for Women and Family Planning described the debate as a “massive test” of how MPs saw women’s rights. “Women elected this government and our demands are clear – we want legal, safe and accessible abortion,” the organisation wrote on social media. “This week we will find out who was worthy of our vote and who we will not trust again.” Poland, long home to some of the EU’s strictest abortion laws, further curtailed women’s rights under the previous rightwing populist government and a 2020 constitutional ruling that barred abortion in the case of foetal abnormalities. The crackdown was linked to the deaths of at least six women as some doctors prioritise saving foetuses – either for ideological reasons or in an attempt to avoid legal consequences – in what Human Rights Watch described last year as a “climate of fear that has heightened risks for women and girls”. Marta Lempart, of the Polish Women’s Strike, a key player in organising the mass protests that followed the 2020 ruling, expressed concern that Third Way would join with far-right parties to defeat the bills in the first reading. She said doing so would be “spitting in the face” of the hundreds of thousands of people who had demanded change. “It’s women of Poland who brought victory to the new government,” Lempart said. The long-running question of how to reform the draconian abortion laws has cast a spotlight on the deep divide in the prime minister Donald Tusk’s unwieldy ruling coalition. On Tuesday Tusk said he hoped MPs from his coalition would allow the legislation to clear the first hurdle in parliament. “There are many indications that this will be the case,” he said. Even if the bills are eventually approved by parliament, the question remains of whether the president, Andrzej Duda, who is aligned with the rightwing former government, will sign them into law. Last month Duda used his veto to kill legislation that would have provided prescription-free emergency contraception to girls and women aged 15 and over, citing his desire to “respect constitutional rights and the standard of health protection for children”. The government later said it would bypass Duda’s veto by allowing pharmacists to provide morning-after pills. While a recent Ipsos survey suggested that 62% of people in Poland support the right to abortion up to 12 weeks, anti-abortion groups mobilised before Thursday’s debate, announcing plans for a march through Warsaw and a rally outside the parliament building.","2024-04-11T13:58:50Z","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/poland-mps-debate-easing-strict-abortion-rules"
"abortion","I left behind an authoritarian state to move to the US. Now I see my new home falling to the same dark forces","“What’s he done now?” My parents live in Cairo and I’m in New York City. We FaceTime once a week and that question is like a game we play. My parents ask about Donald Trump and I ask about Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, whom Trump calls “my favourite dictator”. Aren’t we Egyptian-Americans lucky – a dictator for each side of our hyphen. Tellingly, the “he” my parents ask about has dominated our conversations lately. I moved to the United States from Egypt in 2000 and I have spent the past 25 years watching the US turn into Egypt – from encroaching state power to the increasingly unchecked role of religion in politics. After each travesty – the lies used to invade Iraq, the zealotry that destroyed abortion rights, the arming and financing of Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza – I thought: “Any minute now, there’ll be a revolution, they’ll burn things down.” And here is Trump, finessing that state power into a regime that, as with the regime in Egypt, is targeting culture, education, media, judges, students and any group or entity that poses a threat or even the potential of dissent to the regime. And I’m still waiting for the revolution. I now know, having lived in the US for more than two decades, that most white people in this country would rather hear comparisons to Russia or Hungary than Egypt or a place led by Black or brown autocrats, because even autocracies are separated along racial lines. I joined an anti-Trump protest in NYC earlier this month, which along with others across the country, was said to be the largest single-day protest since Trump’s return to the White House. The signs mocking Trump and his billionaire sidekick Elon Musk were clever and there were dogs dressed in coats that had “I bite fascists” written on them, but the rage had stayed at home. Revolutions need feet on the ground, yes. But they also need rage, and lots of it. White Americans are the largest voting bloc and the group most responsible for bringing Trump to power both times – and they are the least enraged. The privilege of whiteness means that for many in the US, the loss of rights only happens to people who aren’t white, far away somewhere, in places such as Egypt. Only Black and brown people in faraway countries end up with an authoritarian ruler. But, if anything, where the Trump regime is taking the US is infinitely worse than what is happening in Egypt, because Egypt’s footprint on the world is not nearly as damaging as that of the US. This is why I’m enraged at the lack of rage. White people in the US have a delusional amount of confidence in their government and institutions. They are childishly naive in believing that institutions will save them from autocratic power. That stubborn belief in their exceptionalism undergirds the refusal to see the fascism that Trump brought when he was first elected and that he is now cementing. Black and Indigenous people and people of colour have no such delusions. They do not expect institutions to protect them because they are so often hurt by those institutions. To people like me and others who have lived in and survived autocracies, white state power and its institutions have always functioned like a regime – so we are well versed in scepticism of anything that politicians say. No matter how often those of us from authoritarian countries, who know to be suspicious of state power, and those of us who have fought fascism – whether implemented through military rule or the rule of religious fundamentalists – warned and warned, white people in the US arrogantly shook their heads and said it couldn’t happen here. Because the US is like a teenager who is stubbornly determined in their own self-destruction. In Egypt, when I interviewed officials from the Muslim Brotherhood – political Islamists who were Egypt’s most powerful opposition to the regime – about their policies, their answer would invariably be “Islam is the solution”. Their goal was the establishment of an Islamic state. Though the group briefly ruled Egypt after the 2011 revolution before being overthrown by Sisi, never in its wildest dreams would the Muslim Brotherhood have imagined holding as much power as white Christian nationalists in the US, for whom Christianity is the professed solution and who are creating a white Christian state in the most powerful country in the world. If Pete “I want a crusade and I have enough Crusader crosses to earn it” Hegseth were a Muslim, the US would have invaded his country to save the “free world” from his jihad. It is easy to see theocracy when the theocrats and zealots don’t look like you. The US media have been able to report on the ways the Muslim Brotherhood politicised and weaponised religion. But they have failed to bring that same urgency to the politicisation of Christianity in the US, especially by the white Christian nationalists who have been instrumental in bringing Trump to power. White and Christian are considered default – the harmless norm – in the white-dominated newsrooms of the US. As a feminist, I am especially enraged at the inability of US media, as well as many white people generally, to see what religion has done to women in the US. During this term, Trump has so far rowed back any diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and blocked federal funding for abortion services. During his first term, he appointed three conservative supreme court judges, which led to the reversal of Roe v Wade and the removal of federal protection for abortion rights, meaning that individual states can ban abortions. These policies have been promoted by some white women, who serve as foot soldiers of the white supremacist Christian patriarchy. The women who helped destroy abortion rights, for example, are rarely analysed, examined and pathologised in the way that Muslim women are. Living in the US has radicalised me. Over the past 25 years my rage at the state-sponsored patriarchy in both of my countries has injected anarchism into my feminism. Anarcho-feminist conveys the “don’t mess with me” level of rage I’m at. And unless (perhaps until) the Trump regime targets naturalised citizens, NYC will remain my home. Two years before Trump was re-elected, I began strength training. I can now deadlift and squat more than my body weight. The timing had nothing to do with the occupant of the White House and more to do with my personal goals, but my journey feels apt. When fascism flexes its muscles, it’s time to make feminism dangerous again. The rage must come. It will come. Mona Eltahawy writes the FEMINIST GIANT newsletter.

"abortion","When my birth mother rejected me, another woman’s words helped me heal","Sometimes we learn the deepest truths in the most quotidian moments. One afternoon when I was six, I watched a character give birth in an army tent in the sitcom M*A*S*H. I immediately rushed from the den into the kitchen with a very important question for my mother. “Did you give birth to me in a tent like that?” I blurted out, hoping to learn my origin story. Unexpectedly, my mother dashed from the room in tears. When she returned, she sat me down and broke the news I had somehow always known. “Your Uncle Ana brought you home from the hospital to Mommy and Daddy,” she said. “You’re adopted, which means we chose you.” I felt relieved to learn this truth, but as it upset my mom, I resolved never to bring it up again. Still, my thirst for details never waned. My parents and I had the same skin tone, but I didn’t much look like them. I was awkward, gangly and bookish; they were not. Despite their love and acceptance, I had always felt like an alien in my family and could never put my finger on why. In the decades before Google, I was ill-equipped to track down information about my biological parents, especially because I was a minor and adoption records were then sealed in every US state. Shortly after I turned 18, though, I called the hospital where I was born to ask for my records. The clerk, initially warm, seemed puzzled that I didn’t know my last name at birth. After I admitted that I was adopted, a chill fell across the line. My records arrived in the mail a few weeks later, crisscrossed with thick black marker. The clerk had blocked out every trace of personal information: my birth mother’s name, birth date, address and details about her hospital stay. The redacted records reinforced a sense of erasure. I stuffed them away, and tried to move on. Years later, as a journalist adept at digging up information about practically anyone and anything, I continued to hit dead ends when it came to learning more about my biological mother. Then, when I was 35, I used part of a tax refund to hire a private investigator to try to find her contact details. He tracked her down quickly: she was a marine attorney living in Connecticut. Elated and fantasising about a joyful mother-daughter reunion, I quickly fired off a letter, gently suggesting she was my mother and asking for medical history and ethnicity details. My dream turned out to be just that: a fantasy. My birth mother replied, but not in the way I had hoped. In attorney-like fashion, she’d neither confirm nor deny I was the baby she had given up on that late July day, but implied it with her words. “I don’t want to think back on that experience,” she wrote, adding that information about my existence could be “greatly damaging” to her. Her email left me shaken. Surely she’d want to see the person I had become? I summoned the courage to request a photo and perhaps even lunch (we lived about three hours apart). But she insisted that I never contact her again. I didn’t know it at the time, but secondary rejection by a birth parent – when an attempt at reconnection with a birth family fails – is rare and considered a traumatic event, for which some adoptees seek therapeutic support. I dealt with the initial blow with long phone calls to friends and probably a little too much red wine. I didn’t have much time to ruminate, though – I was working towards a master’s degree and later that week headed off to a seminar with my professor at her New York City apartment. During an afternoon tea break, my professor’s partner, a judge, chatted with us at the counter of their cosy kitchen. With a brusque, direct communication style honed in New York City courtrooms, she asked about my life. I blurted out the events of the past few days and told her how I was finding it nearly impossible to focus. She listened intently. Then, as I imagined she might do in court, she began rapid-fire questioning. “When were you born?” she asked. The early 1970s, I told her. “And your mother, was she Catholic?” “Yes,” I replied, “from an Irish Catholic family. One of seven, I think.” “And she was young, probably?” “Yeah – 19, I think.” She paused. “You know, I’m just about the same age as your birth mother,” she said. “It might be hard for you to understand, especially now, but back then it was tough for an Irish-Catholic girl who became pregnant outside marriage.” I almost choked on my tea. Was she really defending my biological mother? My birth mother who was rejecting me again out of shame, cruelty or both? “I didn’t know that,” I admitted. “But it doesn’t excuse her actions. She’s in her 50s, for goodness sake.” Undeterred, the judge explained how pregnant Catholic girls were often sent away to conceal their pregnancies and save face for their families. How the stigma could be overwhelming. She reminded me that abortion was illegal at the time, and Roe v Wade (the decision that legalised abortion in the US) was still a few months off. As we placed our mugs in the sink, she urged me to try to see the situation through another lens, if only for my own peace of mind. “What’s done is done,” she said. “You are alive, and you have the rest of your life ahead of you.” Now that I knew the truth, the only way forward was through. For weeks, I clung to my sense of injustice. Perhaps I had grown attached to the bewildering primal wound I’d carted around since childhood. Like many adoptees, I had long been unable to explain why I felt displaced. Now, I had proof. But if trauma and shame are generational continuums, how do we break the cycle? Over the ensuing months and years, I realised the judge had thrown me a lifeline of sorts. What she said that afternoon had planted seeds of compassion for a woman I could have easily grown to resent. It had blunted the edges of what might have festered into lifelong bitterness, and it fuelled an enduring empathy I’ve applied in many situations since. Her words also became a salve when I was rejected again by a biological uncle, after we were connected by a DNA test. And they were a shot of confidence when I sought and eventually found my biological father’s family – all of whom welcomed me with open arms and not an ounce of hesitation. Above all, the judge’s words in the kitchen that long-ago day allowed me to let go of the need for perfect answers – and make space for imperfect endings.

"abortion","A Man on the Inside to Landman – the seven best shows to stream this week","Pick of the week A Man on the Inside Michael Schur’s delightful retirement home detective comedy was originally based on a true story. While that source material was soon exhausted, it was clear the show had legs. Sure enough, this second season effortlessly transfers its magic to another eccentric institution: Wheeler College, a university that needs the favour of an unpleasant donor to survive. But who is trying to sabotage the deal? It’s a perfect job for Ted Danson’s septuagenarian PI Charles, who must pose as a professor and assess the suspects – including music tutor Mona, played by Danson’s wife Mary Steenburgen. It’s charming stuff, kept afloat by the lead’s irresistible comic chutzpah. Netflix, from Thursday 20 November *** Landman Taylor “Yellowstone” Sheridan’s Texas drama returns for another wallow in America’s last great blue-collar gold rush. With Monty out of the picture, it’s time for Demi Moore’s Cami Miller to step up – and she shows every sign of becoming a terrifyingly efficient ambassador for big oil. Meanwhile, Tommy Norris (Billy Bob Thornton) continues to juggle professional power-broking with a turbulent home life. Landman leans into the mythologising of its setting without really engaging with the environmental consequences but still hits its narrative beats with ruthless precision. Paramount+, from Sunday 16 November *** Byker Grove For viewers of a certain age, this will be an irresistible hit of nostalgia. There is an Ant and Dec-powered reboot of this much-loved coming-of-age drama in the works. In the meantime, it’s now possible to enjoy all 18 seasons of the geordie teen institution, which began in 1989 and, alongside the erstwhile PJ and Duncan, also launched the careers of Donna Air and Charlie Hunnam. The show is undoubtedly of its time but it still looks admirably progressive, tackling homophobia, child abuse and abortion. Not to mention the dangers of paintballing. ITVX, from Sunday 16 November *** June Farms June Farms in the US’s Hudson Valley is the (self-described) “premier events destination of upstate New York”. This series follows Matt Baumgartner, the owner of this idyllic rural venue, as he attempts to deliver perfect bespoke weddings to wealthy urbanites. There’s much focus on the sometimes turbulent lives of Baumgartner’s staff, most of whom seem to be in a constant state of coupling up and dumping each other. But there’s plenty of high-society opulence for viewers to vicariously enjoy alongside the behind-the-scenes dramas. Prime Video, from Monday 17 November *** English Teacher This comedy about a gay, thirtysomething teacher working in a Texas high school continues to be warm, a little formulaic and devoid of much in the way of overt polemical grandstanding. Instead, like all the best educators, it shows rather than tells: Evan Marquez (Brian Jordan Alvarez) is still well-meaning, gently embattled and a fine, low-key argument for diversity. This term sees him attempting to teach Dante’s Inferno to students who are more interested in critiquing his sartorial choices, and helping his students stage a play about the impact of Covid. Disney+, from Wednesday 19 November *** The Mighty Nein The line between gaming and small-screen fiction becomes ever more porous: this animation is set in Exandria, the world created by game designer Matthew Mercer for a 2012 Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. It then expanded into a web series and now reaches (potentially) its ultimate form. But whatever the provenance, the animation and the plotting are fairly traditional – the series follows a group of outcasts and adventurers (including a drunken goblin and a rude monk) as they attempt to combat forces unleashed by a powerful relic known as the Beacon. Prime Video, from Wednesday 16 November *** The Invisibles Like the Slow Horses but empathetic, mutually supportive and hugely competent, the Invisibles in this French crime drama are a motley squad of misfit cops, thrown together as a semi-secret collective to crack the cases that elude their more orthodox colleagues. The team (which includes a duchess, a military veteran and an ex-boxer) specialise in identifying unknown corpses, which range from a woman found dead in her wedding dress to a body discovered built into a wall during a house renovation.

"abortion","Mitch McConnell refuses to say whether he supports a US national abortion ban","Asked whether he supports a federal abortion ban, the US Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Sunday that he is “not advocating anything at this level”. The Republican, during remarks in a new interview published by NBC’s Meet the Press, stopped short of saying whether or not he supported a 15-week federal ban on abortion with exceptions, but he instead portrayed the issue as “a practical matter” that was too divisive among federal lawmakers to result in a consensus among them. Alluding to comments from 2022 in which he said a national ban was “possible”, McConnell said, “I said it was possible. I didn’t say that was my view. I just said it was possible.” The Meet the Press host, Kristen Welker, pressed McConnell to explain if he supported a federal ban, prompting the Kentucky senator to reply: “The reason I said it was possible is because the supreme court has put this back into the legislative arena. And we’re seeing it play out all across the country. And I think in the end, it’ll reflect the views of these individual states. But I said: ‘Possible’. I didn’t say that was my view. “I don’t think we’ll get 60 votes in the Senate for any kind of national legislation,” he continued, referring to the number of votes needed to end the debate on bills in the Senate and get a vote on them. “I think it’s a practical matter. It’s gonna be sorted out at the state level.” McConnell went on to reaffirm that he believes the issue of abortion access is one that should be decided by individual states after the US supreme court’s decision in 2022 to eliminate the federal abortion rights once established by the Roe v Wade case. “I’m not advocating anything at this level,” he said. “It seems to me views about this issue at the state level vary depending where you are. And we get elected by states. And my members are smart enough to figure out how they want to deal with this very divisive issue based upon the people who actually send them here.” McConnell said he also does not think legislation seeking to federalize abortion rights would get the 60 votes it would need to be voted on in the Senate either. In 2022, the South Carolina Republican senator Lindsey Graham proposed a federal ban that would prohibit abortions after 15 weeks. Following Graham’s proposal at the time, McConnell told reporters: “With regard to his bill, you’ll have to ask him about it. In terms of scheduling, I think most of the members of my conference prefer that this be dealt with at the state level.” McConnell’s latest interview comes after the supreme court recently heard an abortion rights case centering on how states can decide when to permit emergency abortions. The case involves Idaho, which has one of the country’s strictest abortion bans and only permits doctors to perform an abortion to save the patient’s life. However, under federal law, doctors are required to stabilize patients’ health if either their life or limb is threatened. The conservative-majority US supreme court, which appeared divided as of Wednesday, is expected to rule on the case in June.","2024-04-28T16:30:42Z","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/28/mitch-mcconnell-national-abortion-ban"
"abortion","FBI to reinvestigate 2023 White House cocaine find and leak of supreme court Dobbs draft","The FBI will launch new investigations into the 2023 discovery of a bag of cocaine at the White House during Joe Biden’s term, as well as into pipe bombs discovered at Democratic and Republican party headquarters before the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. The discoveries predate the leak of the supreme court’s draft opinion before the historic overturning of national abortion rights with the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v Wade in 2022. Dan Bongino, a rightwing podcaster turned deputy director of the FBI, made the announcement on X, where he said he had requested weekly briefings on any progress in looking into the old cases. The incidents have been popular talking points on America’s political right wing and among conspiracy theorists. Bongino said that he and the FBI director, Kash Patel, had been evaluating “a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest” and had made a decision “to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases”. The FBI deputy director made an appeal for “investigative tips on these matters”. The discovery of a small, zippered bag of cocaine in a cubby near the entrance to the West Wing two years ago drew excited commentary from Republicans, including then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has said it was implausible the drugs could belong to anyone beyond Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden – even though the Biden family was away from Washington at the time. Bongino has previously alleged, without presenting any evidence, that he was in touch with whistleblowers who told him they were “suspicious” that evidence from the White House cocaine bag “could match a member of the inner Biden circle”. A formal laboratory test confirmed that the powder found was indeed cocaine and the Secret Service said the substance was found in a “highly trafficked” area of the White House and it was reviewing visitor logs to determine how it had gotten there. Then White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that public tours of the West Wing had taken place over the weekend when the discovery was made, prompting an evacuation of the executive mansion. “We have confidence that they will get to the bottom of this,” Jean-Pierre later said, referring to the Secret Service. A White House spokesperson said that the allegations that Hunter Biden was involved was “incredibly irresponsible”. But in his first interview as president in February this year, Trump returned to the subject, arguing that forensic analysis should have revealed fingerprints but the evidence appeared to have been deliberately wiped clean. He described the cocaine discovery as a “terrible thing”. Politico’s pre-emptive publication of the supreme court’s opinion ending the constitutional right to abortion on 2 May 2022 provoked condemnation from Trump, who called the source of the leak “slime” and demanded that the journalists involved be imprisoned until they revealed who it was. Eight months later, the supreme court released a 23-page report into the leak saying the investigative team “has to date been unable to identify a person responsible by a preponderance of the evidence”. Investigations into both cases ended without identifying who was responsible for the cocaine or the leak. Bongino also announced more resources for the FBI’s investigation into the placement of pipe bombs at the Democratic national committee and the Republican national committee in Washington. The bombs, which were later defused, had been planted the night before Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.
